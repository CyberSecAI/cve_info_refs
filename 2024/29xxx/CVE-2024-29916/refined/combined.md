# Unsaflok

Unsaflok is a series of serious security vulnerabilities in dormakaba’s Saflok electronic RFID locks, commonly used in hotels and multi-family housing environments.

When combined, the identified weaknesses **allow an attacker to unlock all rooms in a hotel using a single pair of forged keycards**. Over three million hotel locks in 131 countries are affected.

The vulnerabilities were reported to dormakaba in September of 2022 and disclosed in March 2024 by [Lennert Wouters](https://twitter.com/LennertWo), [Ian Carroll](https://ian.sh), [rqu](https://twitter.com/rqu53), [BusesCanFly](https://twitter.com/BusesCanFly), [Sam Curry](https://twitter.com/samwcyo), [sshell](https://twitter.com/sshell_), and [Will Caruana](https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-caruana).

> Our slides from DEF CON 32, which contain additional technical information about these vulnerabilities, are now available [here](https://unsaflok.com/videos/slides.pdf).

## FAQs

### What locks are impacted?

The vulnerability impacts over 3 million doors on over 13,000 properties in 131 countries. All locks using the Saflok system are impacted, including (but not limited to) Saflok MT, the Quantum Series, the RT Series, the Saffire Series and the Confidant Series.

These are primarily used in hotels where the management software is System 6000 or Ambiance. Some applications in the multifamily housing space which use System 6000 or Community are also affected.

Saflok MT and Saflok RT Plus (pictured below) are the most common models of impacted locks. Note that while it is possible to visually identify a Saflok lock, it is not possible to visually see if the locks have been patched.

### Have the vulnerabilities been fixed?

Dormakaba started working on a fix after they received our vulnerability report, and began upgrading hotels in November of 2023. As of 03/2024, approximately 36% of the impacted locks have been updated or replaced.

Upgrading each hotel is an intensive process. All locks require a software update or have to be replaced. Additionally, all keycards have to be reissued, front desk software and card encoders have to be upgraded, and 3rd party integrations (e.g. elevators, parking garages and payment systems) may require additional upgrades.

We are disclosing limited information on the vulnerability now to ensure hotel staff and guests are aware of the potential security concern. It will take an extended period of time for the majority of hotels to be upgraded.

### How can I tell if a lock has been updated?

It is not possible to visually tell if a lock has been updated to fix these vulnerabilities. You may be able to tell if a hotel has been through the upgrade process if the guest keycards are using MIFARE Ultralight C cards instead of MIFARE Classic.

The NFC Taginfo app by NXP is available for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nxp.taginfolite&hl=en_US&gl=US) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nfc-taginfo-by-nxp/id1246143596) and can be used to identify the type of keycard.

Note that this information only applies to dormakaba Saflok systems; several other lock manufacturers use MIFARE Classic keycards and are not affected by the Unsaflok vulnerability. Nevertheless, the use of MIFARE Classic in a security sensitive application is not recommended.

### Will the deadbolt protect against a forged keycard?

**No.** Saflok locks can retract the deadbolt from software, and the deadbolt can be overridden by a malicious keycard. In order to deter entry into a room, another physical locking device must be used, such as a chain lock found in many hotels.

### What does an attacker need to perform this attack?

An attacker only needs to read one keycard from the property to perform the attack against any door in the property. This keycard can be from their own room, or even an expired keycard taken from the express checkout collection box.

Forged keycards can then be created using any MIFARE Classic card, and any commercially available tool capable of writing data to these cards. One pair of forged keycards allows an attacker to open any door in the property.

### Can the attack be carried out using a Flipper Zero or other tools?

Yes, this attack can also be performed using any device that is capable of reading and writing or emulating MIFARE Classic cards. This includes tools like the Proxmark3 and Flipper Zero, but also **an NFC capable Android phone**.

### Is it possible to detect an occurence of this attack?

It may be possible to detect certain attacks by auditing the lock’s entry/exit logs. Hotel staff can audit this via the HH6 device and look for suspicious entry/exit records. Due to the vulnerability, entry/exit records could be attributed to the wrong keycard or staff member.

### Has this vulnerability been exploited?

Dormakaba started selling Saflok locks in 1988, which means that vulnerable locks have been in use for over 36 years.

While we are not aware of any real world attacks that use these vulnerabilities, it is not impossible that these vulnerabilities are known, and have been used, by others.

### How does Unsaflok relate to the Saflok KDF that was published recently?

Dormakaba uses a Key Derivation Function (KDF) to derive the keys for some of the Saflok MIFARE Classic sectors. This proprietary KDF only uses the card’s Unique IDentifier (UID) as an input.

Knowledge of the KDF allows an attacker to easily read and clone a Saflok MIFARE Classic card. However, the KDF by itself is not sufficient for an attacker to create arbitrary Saflok keycards.

We are aware that this KDF has been reverse engineered by several people over the years, and that it was published recently after we had disclosed our findings to dormakaba.

### Are you sharing more technical information or proof of concepts?

We are not planning on sharing a full proof of concept at this time due to the potential impact to hotels and guests. We plan on sharing additional technical details of the vulnerability in the future.

### What was the disclosure timeline?

* **08/2022:** Our research began on Saflok locks
* **09/2022:** We completed a proof of concept exploit and contacted dormakaba
* **10/2022:** We had our first meeting with dormakaba about the issues
* **2022 - 2024**: During this time we had at least 13 meetings with dormakaba
* **11/2023:** First hotels upgraded to resolve vulnerability
* **03/2024:** Coordinated disclosure of the vulnerability’s high-level details

### How can I contact you?

[00:00] [Applause]
[00:03] thanks everyone uh Welcome to our talk
[00:04] titled unsa loock unlocking millions of
[00:07] Hotel
[00:08] locks I'm Leonard I'm a Hardware
[00:10] security researcher at the K Loven
[00:12] University in Belgium I typically do
[00:15] research related to um voltage glitching
[00:17] and other Hardware
[00:18] attacks uh I'm Ian I'm a application
[00:21] security researcher uh I was formerly at
[00:23] the red team at Robin Hood and now I run
[00:25] a point search engine called C uh we got
[00:28] sued by our Canada
[00:32] so as you can probably tell from the
[00:34] first slide neither of us is really
[00:36] working on locks or RFID stuff all of
[00:39] the time so when we started working on
[00:40] this it was all relatively new to us and
[00:43] the reason we started looking at these
[00:45] locks is that a group of us got invited
[00:49] to hack some Las Vegas hotels back in
[00:51] 2022 and they were running a bug Bounty
[00:53] program and one of the elements of the
[00:55] hotel room that was in scope were the
[00:57] hotel locks and that's how we got nerd
[01:00] sniped and started looking at these
[01:02] Hotel logs now it wasn't just Ian and me
[01:04] there were more people involved and some
[01:06] of them were sitting here on the on the
[01:08] first row so thanks
[01:14] everyone so here some related research
[01:16] of other researchers so back in 2020
[01:20] 202 2012 uh Sarah looked at the on
[01:24] loocks and she found that there is a
[01:27] programming part on the outside of the
[01:28] door and if you plug in into this you
[01:30] can actually start reading memory of the
[01:32] lock itself and if you analyze this
[01:35] memory you can um extract the side code
[01:38] and this side code is enough to send an
[01:40] unlock command to the door and then open
[01:41] it up uh back then Sarah immediately
[01:45] published all of the details of the
[01:46] attack and this resulted in some people
[01:49] making their own devices going to hotels
[01:51] opening all of the doors stealing TVs
[01:53] and so on um there's a very nice wired
[01:56] article about this sort of um hacking
[01:58] spree that some people went on it's a
[02:01] it's well worth the read I would
[02:03] say then 6 years later in 2018 um there
[02:07] was an attack on the v card system by
[02:09] ASA abloy this was an attack by
[02:11] researchers from F secure and they
[02:13] figured out that if you can read one
[02:15] card from the hotel that they can make a
[02:18] master key and then open every door in
[02:20] the hotel essentially um in this case f
[02:23] secure worked with Asa aoy on a fix and
[02:26] this also meant that the talk didn't
[02:27] include a lot of technical details
[02:30] and this is um something where we want
[02:32] to strike a balance so instead of
[02:34] publishing all of the details
[02:35] immediately we went to a long um
[02:37] responsible disclosure process and now
[02:39] we are sharing some of the details of
[02:41] what we
[02:43] found so this talk is about dormakaba
[02:46] saf loock uh it was introduced in 1988
[02:49] by computerized security systems uh back
[02:51] then it was a magstripe lock and then
[02:53] they became RFID locks uh it has kind of
[02:56] a weird corporate history uh
[02:57] computerized security systems was
[02:58] acquired by cabba in 2006 and then in
[03:01] 2015 two companies called Dorma and Cava
[03:04] merged and now it's called Dorma
[03:07] Cava uh saf loock is used on 3 million
[03:09] doors in 13,000 hotels in 131 countries
[03:13] so this is one of the biggest brands of
[03:14] Hotel
[03:16] locks um it's important to talk about
[03:18] the architecture before we start so
[03:20] these locks are usually entirely offline
[03:22] so there's the front desk server and the
[03:24] front desk computers have a connection
[03:26] but they're not connected to the actual
[03:27] Hotel locks and so the front desk will
[03:29] write the key card that contains the
[03:31] information of what doors it should open
[03:33] and then uh the locks make the decisions
[03:36] entirely themselves they don't contact
[03:37] any server or anything um but in the
[03:40] case of when the lock needs to be
[03:41] upgraded or if you need to see the
[03:43] access history there's this unit called
[03:44] the hh6 uh and you can plug into a USB
[03:47] port on the bottom of the lock to use
[03:48] this so generally that's the only
[03:50] connection these locks
[03:52] have um and some places especially in
[03:55] large Vegas hotels they use kind of a
[03:57] semi online architecture so in this case
[03:59] the hallways have zigg coordinators in
[04:01] them and this allows the front desk to
[04:03] kind of see the audit log um it still
[04:05] doesn't make it an online system the key
[04:07] cards are still read by the lock and the
[04:09] lock determines if it opens or not but
[04:11] afterwards it tells the front desk hey
[04:13] this key open this lock um this might be
[04:16] beneficial for hotels because you can
[04:18] kind of detect what keys are being
[04:22] used so when we were starting out um we
[04:26] needed a hotel to do our research on we
[04:28] don't own a hotel so we had to build one
[04:30] ourselves and that first B acquiring the
[04:33] system 6000 software as with any
[04:35] software this is software you can find
[04:38] on some places on the internet the other
[04:41] thing you need is an RFID encoder so
[04:43] this is the device that the front desk
[04:44] will use to encode a new um key card
[04:48] back in 2022 these were very expensive
[04:50] on eBay $600 to just get one now thanks
[04:54] to our research these have really come
[04:56] down in price so now you can find them
[04:57] for $45 online
[05:01] [Applause]
[05:05] so the the reason they are much cheaper
[05:06] these days is they all have to be
[05:08] replaced so all of the hotels are
[05:09] essentially selling their old encoders
[05:11] online so another thing you need are
[05:14] myair classic 1K cards these are very
[05:16] common very cheap you can find them
[05:18] everywhere um and optionally if you want
[05:21] to actually open some some doors you can
[05:23] also buy on eBay some door locks or a
[05:26] hh6 programmer if you want to play with
[05:28] one of those
[05:30] so now that we have all of the elements
[05:31] for our hotel we have to set it up so we
[05:34] start by installing the software if you
[05:37] open the manual the installation manual
[05:39] the first step it tells you is to
[05:40] disable all of the Windows security
[05:42] features and then you're good to start
[05:44] running the
[05:46] installer once you've installed the
[05:48] software you copy over a GDB database
[05:50] file to the installation directory and
[05:52] then you can start the
[05:54] software this database file is very
[05:56] useful to us um it's a firebirth
[05:59] database file file um it has a default
[06:01] username and password on there and so
[06:03] you can start reading all of the the
[06:05] elements in the database so this
[06:07] contains configuration data for your
[06:08] specific hotel but also all of the cards
[06:11] that were created by the hotel software
[06:14] so this means that if you create a card
[06:15] you can go look into the in the database
[06:17] and look at all of the different fields
[06:19] that are encoded on the
[06:21] card now as I said back in 2022 real
[06:24] encoders were very expensive um but we
[06:27] figured out that this system used to to
[06:29] support just commercial RFID reader
[06:32] writers at some point so that means that
[06:35] you can go into the firebirth database
[06:37] and you can set the height Legacy
[06:39] encoder flag to zero and now you can use
[06:41] the she sheep of the Shelf um encoder
[06:44] essentially so that this is what we used
[06:46] back in 2012 uh 20
[06:50] yeah so about the handheld programmer so
[06:53] as I mentioned before all of these locks
[06:55] have a mini USB port on the bottom of it
[06:58] and obviously that struck our interest
[06:59] pretty quickly because it's you know
[07:01] behind it's in the hallway um so we
[07:04] bought the hh6 off of eBay um and we
[07:07] tried to use it in a lock at first and
[07:09] we hit an issue where it detected it was
[07:11] being used at the wrong property and so
[07:13] we were like okay there's some kind of
[07:14] authentication here uh but then we
[07:17] quickly realized that if we just changed
[07:18] the property ID in our database to the
[07:20] property we were staying at it would
[07:21] start working uh and so there's a lot of
[07:25] interesting features in here and we
[07:26] didn't use it too much in our attack but
[07:28] the main interesting thing is you can
[07:30] actually interrogate these locks and you
[07:32] can view every entry and every exit to
[07:34] the room so for example you can even see
[07:36] you know when housekeeping entered your
[07:38] room you can see when they left um you
[07:40] can see the previous guest you can see
[07:41] when they were coming and going and if
[07:43] you know the property ID you can
[07:45] actually do this to any door on any
[07:46] hotel um it was also useful for our
[07:49] purposes it will tell you why it refused
[07:51] to open the door so for a long time we
[07:53] were making fake key cards and we
[07:54] couldn't figure out why it wasn't
[07:55] opening but the hh6 will actually tell
[07:57] you hey this is why your key card didn't
[07:59] work so that's very useful for our
[08:03] purposes so the next step was to reverse
[08:06] engineer the system 6,000 software um
[08:09] the software consists out of some dely
[08:11] executables which are very annoying to
[08:13] reverse engineer but luckily there are
[08:15] also some net um binaries in there and
[08:18] those are very easy to reverse engineer
[08:20] we can simply decompile them and look at
[08:22] the code in we now we had a few goals
[08:25] for reverse engineering the system we
[08:26] wanted to understand how the myair SE
[08:29] keys are derived how the data stored on
[08:32] the cart is encrypted and then once the
[08:35] data is decrypted what is actually the
[08:37] meaning of the different fields of this
[08:40] data so first a quick introduction to
[08:42] myair Classic most of the safl
[08:44] deployments use Myer classic 1K cards
[08:47] these 1K cards have 16 sectors each
[08:50] containing four 16 by blocks so they are
[08:53] essentially just storing data block zero
[08:56] is special it's the manufacturer block
[08:58] it contains the the uid and the
[09:00] manufacturer data and then the last
[09:03] block of every sector contains the keys
[09:06] so the keys that you need to
[09:07] authenticate and to read the data on the
[09:10] card every sector has two keys
[09:12] Associated to it key a and key B and
[09:15] then essentially the access conditions
[09:18] indicate what actions you're allowed to
[09:20] perform with either of these
[09:23] Keys then if you look specifically at
[09:25] the saf loock cards in in the case of
[09:28] the saf loock system all of the
[09:30] interesting data is stored in sector
[09:32] zero um and the key to read that sector
[09:34] is derived from the uid so all of the
[09:37] keys marked in Orange on the slide are
[09:39] unique for every key card so they always
[09:41] change but they are derived from the uid
[09:44] which is not a very secure way of
[09:46] implementing this the key for sector one
[09:49] is the same on every safo cart across
[09:51] all of the deployments and that means
[09:53] that if you read one of these cards and
[09:55] you see this key then you immediately
[09:57] know it's a saf loock system
[10:00] so the key derivation function um to
[10:03] read the data from the card we need the
[10:05] keys to authenticate to the sector
[10:07] there's a few ways you can get those
[10:09] keys you can use a box Mark 3 run hfmf
[10:12] autoone and it will immediately spit out
[10:14] all of the keys for you the other way to
[10:17] do it is to actually reverse engineer
[10:19] the key derivation function and it turns
[10:21] out that back in 2022 multiple people
[10:24] had already done this they had reverse
[10:26] engineered the kdf but they hadn't
[10:28] published it so at the time we had to
[10:30] reverse engineer it ourselves in the
[10:32] meantime someone has published the kdf
[10:36] and now it's also implemented in the
[10:37] prox Mark 3 project and in The Flipper
[10:42] zero it's maybe interesting to know that
[10:44] knowing the kdf is not strictly
[10:47] necessary for our attack and that's
[10:49] because there are cryptographic attacks
[10:51] on the Myer classic
[10:53] cards so reverse engineering the kdf um
[10:56] we figured out that the sefl C encoder
[10:59] dll contains a Caba get secured Keys
[11:02] function which implements this kdf
[11:05] initially we weren't 100% sure that this
[11:07] is the correct function we wanted to
[11:09] reverse engineer so we we made a simple
[11:11] python rapper that uses the dll and then
[11:13] we could feed in some uids and check if
[11:16] the response was the same key as what we
[11:18] were seeing uh in the proxar project
[11:20] essentially and then later on when we
[11:22] were sure this was the correct function
[11:24] we translated it to python so that we
[11:26] had our own library for it
[11:30] so now we have a pretty good way of
[11:31] reading the data on the myair card but
[11:33] of course our goal is not just to clone
[11:35] it we want to modify what rooms the key
[11:37] can open uh and so we learned that
[11:39] really the only data that matters is the
[11:41] 16 bytes on block one which kind of
[11:42] tells the lock which doors the lock can
[11:44] open and then the first bite on block
[11:46] two is a check sum of the first block uh
[11:49] and so we wanted to figure out it looked
[11:51] like the data was encrypted on the
[11:52] sector because we didn't really see
[11:54] anything meaningful in it and we found
[11:55] this encrypt card and decrypt card
[11:57] function in the firebird Services deal
[11:59] and so using that we discovered that the
[12:02] data on the card was actually encrypted
[12:03] using just a substitution table uh and
[12:06] we unfortunately also learned that that
[12:08] substitution table is the same for every
[12:10] saff loock Hotel so every saff loock
[12:12] installation has the keys to decrypt and
[12:14] encrypt every Seth loock
[12:17] card um and so now we know how to
[12:19] decrypt it um and now we want to start
[12:21] changing what the fields are but we had
[12:24] the decrypted data but we still didn't
[12:25] really know what those 16 bytes
[12:26] represented uh luckily in the same dll
[12:28] we found a function that we didn't think
[12:30] was actually being used but it basically
[12:32] assembled the 16 bytes for an emergency
[12:35] card and so we kind of took a look at
[12:36] this function and saw you know what
[12:38] Fields is it right to on sector one and
[12:41] we were able to kind of work from there
[12:42] work backwards and say okay these bites
[12:44] are the expiration these bites are the
[12:46] room number stuff like that um and being
[12:49] able to create cards was also very
[12:50] useful we had our fake Hotel so we
[12:52] created some cards and we to decrypt
[12:53] that data and see you know do the fields
[12:56] align with what we expected and so
[12:58] slowly B by bite we figured out what the
[13:00] data was starting to
[13:03] mean so this is the full car data format
[13:07] for the SF loock
[13:08] systems it is in alphabetical order so
[13:11] if you want to reproduce it you will
[13:12] have to figure out the correct order of
[13:14] the fields there's a few logical fields
[13:16] in here there's the card creation date
[13:18] so this is like up to the second when
[13:21] the card was created at the front desk
[13:23] um there are card levels indicating if
[13:25] this is a guest key a master key or an
[13:28] emergency key there's quite a few of
[13:29] these levels there's a few different
[13:32] types of cards but we'll get into those
[13:34] later on um there's a deadbolt override
[13:36] bit which sounds very interesting
[13:38] obviously um and then there's a few more
[13:41] Fields so the lock ID is an interesting
[13:43] one this is just a numerical indicator
[13:46] in a database linking a specific linking
[13:48] to a specific lock so you can't simply
[13:52] figure out what the lock ID is for a
[13:53] specific room number but if you know the
[13:56] lock ID for your room number you can
[13:58] sort of get what the room next door has
[14:01] as a lock
[14:02] ID the other thing that we need to know
[14:04] to make cards for every deployment is
[14:06] the property ID so this is u a 12 bit
[14:10] number that is supposed to be different
[14:11] for every hotel and to make a card for a
[14:14] hotel you need to know this property ID
[14:17] and finally there's a sequence and
[14:18] combination field and this was by far
[14:21] the most annoying field in this entire
[14:23] data format and it took us quite a while
[14:25] to figure out how to work around this
[14:29] so as I mentioned before multiple card
[14:32] levels and card
[14:33] types most of the keys you will get when
[14:35] you check into a hotel will have lower
[14:38] levels so guest Keys connector Keys
[14:40] sweet keys and so on and they typically
[14:43] only open a single room in the property
[14:46] then there's more special cards like
[14:47] housekeeping Keys um that typically open
[14:50] a range of rooms so maybe a floor or a
[14:53] specific Tower in the hotel and then
[14:55] finally we get to the the interesting
[14:56] ones like the emergency key and the
[14:58] emergency key is interesting because
[15:01] since it's used for emergencies it also
[15:03] overrides the dead bolt so if someone
[15:05] inside of the room flips the debolt and
[15:08] someone Taps an emergency key on the
[15:09] card it will allow them to override this
[15:11] debolt I think it's important to realize
[15:14] if you're staying in a hotel the
[15:15] deadbolt is just software
[15:17] controlled two more interesting key
[15:20] levels are the programming primary
[15:22] programming key and secondary
[15:23] programming key and we think the idea
[15:26] here is that you would step one of these
[15:27] cards to a lock before or you can
[15:29] actually reprogram the lock with an hh6
[15:34] programmer so as Leonard said we spent
[15:36] quite a lot of time on the sequence and
[15:38] combination because we knew what every
[15:39] field meant but we couldn't figure out
[15:41] the valid sequence combination uh for a
[15:43] lock so each lock has its own
[15:45] combination value between 0 and
[15:47] 4,95 um and as L said you can kind of
[15:50] guess what lock IDs are but guessing the
[15:51] combination is very painful um and
[15:53] there's also a sequence number and so
[15:55] this is used just as you check in and
[15:56] check out each guest gets their own
[15:58] sequence number so for example if
[15:59] someone checks in after you they'll tap
[16:01] their sequence number and that will
[16:02] invalidate all the previous ones so that
[16:04] prevents you know two people from having
[16:06] a valid key to the same room as that
[16:08] would be pretty bad um and the field is
[16:10] just the sequence encrypted combined
[16:12] with a combination and as I said this is
[16:14] really the only field that gave us any
[16:16] trouble in making a valid guess
[16:18] key at first we tried to BR Force the
[16:21] field uh Leonard tapped the prox Mark
[16:24] about 4,000 times uh trying to guess
[16:26] what the valid uh sequence number was uh
[16:29] this doesn't work I don't suggest it uh
[16:31] the lock does detect that you're trying
[16:33] to just guess key cards and it kind of
[16:35] shuts itself down um it's also very
[16:37] physically strenuous and
[16:39] annoying um later kind of the Crux of
[16:42] our Discovery was that we found that
[16:44] because these locks are offline they
[16:45] sometimes have to be resequenced if they
[16:47] become desynchronized with the front
[16:49] desk um and what a resequencing card
[16:51] does is it just simply tells lock hey
[16:53] this is your new sequence and this is
[16:54] your new combination and that's perfect
[16:56] for us because those were the only two
[16:57] fields we didn't know so we were able to
[17:00] create a key card that simply resequence
[17:02] a lock and tells it hey this is your new
[17:03] secret value and that's the only one you
[17:05] need to create a forg key
[17:08] card so now we have all the elements to
[17:11] make a full attack so the idea is that
[17:13] you would start by obtaining any card
[17:15] from the hotel just to get a property ID
[17:18] this can be your own card this can be an
[17:20] expired card can be a card you found on
[17:22] the floor from the Express checkout box
[17:25] or simply one you bought from eBay so
[17:27] once you have the property ID we can
[17:29] start forging keys so we Forge a
[17:32] resequencing key card for a privileged
[17:35] level so emergency or grandm and the
[17:38] reason for picking emergency is that it
[17:40] works on all of the doors so you don't
[17:42] have to guess a lock ID
[17:44] anymore then you walk up to a door you
[17:47] tap your resequencing key card it res
[17:49] sequences the lock and then you have
[17:50] your second key card that is an opening
[17:52] key for the same level and it will open
[17:54] the door and the nice thing is you make
[17:57] this pair of cards once for every
[17:59] property and you can now walk around and
[18:01] open every single door in the in the
[18:11] hotel so of course we also implemented
[18:13] this as a full proof of concept attack
[18:16] um at this point we had already written
[18:17] a pflock module so it's a python module
[18:20] that supports doing the key derivation
[18:22] function decrypting the car data
[18:24] deserializing it into the different
[18:26] fields then we can change fields re
[18:28] encrypt it or re serialize it reencrypt
[18:31] it and I write it back to a card and
[18:34] instead of implementing all of this
[18:35] within the boxmark code base since we
[18:37] already had the python script we sort of
[18:39] Made Simple rapper functions that that
[18:41] call boxar code to read and write stuff
[18:44] uh to a
[18:46] card then
[18:47] obviously these days we have to
[18:49] implement the same thing on a flipper
[18:51] zero this was relatively straightforward
[18:54] um you can make an NFC supported card
[18:57] plugin and that ENT has to implement
[18:59] three functions so the first function is
[19:02] verify and that's essentially a function
[19:04] that tries to verify if the card you
[19:06] tapped is a saffo card as I mentioned
[19:08] earlier sector one has a default key and
[19:11] you can use that default key to detect
[19:13] if the card is a saffo card now that you
[19:16] show at SEF card you go to the read
[19:18] function the read function drives the
[19:21] key so implements the kdf and then reads
[19:24] the relevant data blocks now that you
[19:26] have those data blocks you can decrypt
[19:28] them pars out the data and then from
[19:31] there generate a resequence an Emergency
[19:33] card that gets stored on the flippers
[19:35] file
[19:36] system before anyone asks we're not
[19:39] releasing this uh plugin um but there is
[19:42] a kdf plugin available on GitHub that's
[19:44] someone else made and you can actually
[19:46] use that plugin to check if you're
[19:48] staying at a safl
[19:53] hotel so as we mentioned previously we
[19:55] actually found this at Defcon two years
[19:56] ago um and it was very long disclosure
[19:59] process uh so in in August we kind of
[20:02] found you know the decryption key and we
[20:04] were able to read and write to the card
[20:05] but we didn't actually figure out the
[20:07] resequencing thing until a month later
[20:09] um finally we able we were able to
[20:11] figure that out and we we created a
[20:13] complete proof of concept um
[20:15] unfortunately dor makava didn't have any
[20:17] disclosure process and so I had to
[20:19] message their ciso on LinkedIn uh
[20:22] luckily he actually took it seriously
[20:24] and responded quickly uh and they
[20:25] actually have a VDP now I think which is
[20:27] great um um we had our first meeting
[20:30] with them in uh October and from there I
[20:33] think we had at least 13 meetings with
[20:35] dormakaba talking about the
[20:36] vulnerability and how they were going to
[20:38] fix it um as I mentioned it's 3 million
[20:40] Hotel locks and I don't think they were
[20:43] fully ready to do that offgrade for a
[20:45] while and it was quite a painful change
[20:48] uh but in November 2023 they upgraded
[20:50] the first hotels to resolve the
[20:51] vulnerability which was great uh and
[20:54] then as you may have seen in March of
[20:56] 2024 we did a a limited disclosure of
[20:59] saying you know these Hotel locks have a
[21:00] vulnerability but you know we're not
[21:01] going to say exactly what it is um at
[21:04] the time we published it 30 36% of the
[21:06] locks have been upgraded um today is our
[21:08] Defcon talk uh they only told us the
[21:11] majority of the locks have been updated
[21:12] we don't have a specific percentage
[21:13] anymore um and they said nearly all Las
[21:16] Vegas properties are in the process of
[21:18] being mitigated or have been mitigated
[21:20] uh more or
[21:23] less um remediation uh they added a new
[21:27] enhanced security mode uh and this is to
[21:29] their Ambiance software so we mostly
[21:31] looked at system 6000 that's kind of
[21:33] deprecated now there is there is a fix
[21:35] for it but it's not as good as the
[21:36] enhanced security mode uh the new
[21:38] enhanced security mode has a new kdf um
[21:41] it encrypts the card data using AES
[21:43] which is much better than a hardcoded
[21:44] substitution Cipher uh and it also uses
[21:47] Myer ultralight C so even if you're able
[21:49] to decrypt the card data it's still hard
[21:51] to actually write it to the card because
[21:52] you don't know the card Keys um and as L
[21:55] mentioned previously they also replaced
[21:56] all of the encoders and so there's a new
[21:58] coder for making the keys that also has
[22:00] a secure element inside of
[22:04] it so a lot of people ask us why did it
[22:06] take so long to fix these Hotel walks
[22:08] why did it take two years and it turns
[22:10] out that the main issue are the
[22:12] Integrations so of course first taba had
[22:15] to come up with a fix for their own
[22:16] hotel logs but then if you start
[22:18] thinking about especially big Las Vegas
[22:20] properties they have so many
[22:22] Integrations with the hotel locks so
[22:24] maybe you used the kiosk to check in um
[22:26] you've used the elevators um there's
[22:29] Payment Solutions in some hotels and
[22:31] some hotels even have towel machines and
[22:33] so when a hotel decides to upgrade their
[22:36] hotel locks all of these systems have to
[22:37] be upgraded as well and that typically
[22:39] means that they have to contact the
[22:41] manufacturers of these systems and so
[22:43] you can imagine this takes a long
[22:45] time most of the locks have to be
[22:47] updated manually that means that someone
[22:49] has to walk up to the door and hold the
[22:51] programmer in front of the lock for 2
[22:53] minutes 3 million locks times 2 minutes
[22:56] is a lot of minutes so that's it takes a
[22:59] long time then Additionally you have to
[23:02] um convince Property Owners to perform
[23:05] this update and that's also one of the
[23:06] reasons we had this limited disclosure
[23:08] initially to make Hotel owners aware of
[23:11] the vulnerability and give them some
[23:12] extra time to to implement the fix we
[23:15] were told that at the peak um of of
[23:17] deploying this fix stor maabo was um
[23:20] resolving 500 properties per
[23:23] week another thing that has changed um
[23:26] now in the new update is that the guest
[23:28] cards will be using ultral light c um
[23:31] and one of the reasons people are making
[23:33] this switch over to ultral light C now
[23:35] is that the cost of ultralite C cards
[23:37] has come down a lot over the last few
[23:39] years so if we talk about card cost we
[23:42] found a few statistics online so on
[23:46] average a hotel is occupied um
[23:49] 65% an average stay at a hotel takes 1.8
[23:54] nights the average number of cards that
[23:56] gets made per stay is two
[23:58] and only 25% of all cards are returned
[24:01] when you check out now if we think about
[24:04] big Las Vegas properties that have
[24:06] between 3,000 and 7,000 rooms then you
[24:09] can imagine they make a lot of cards so
[24:10] if we do a bit of simple mat then we end
[24:14] up with a hotel with 5,000 rooms having
[24:18] roughly 660,000 um stays per year that
[24:23] means that around 1.3 million cars are
[24:25] made at one of these big properties of
[24:28] which only only 300,000 are being
[24:30] returned after stays so that means that
[24:32] a hotel needs to buy roughly 1 million
[24:35] cards per year if you assume 10 cents
[24:38] per card that's $100,000 just in RFID
[24:41] cards now if you think about a Myer
[24:43] classic card which is very cheap and
[24:46] maybe those were 10 cents if an ultral
[24:49] light C card a few years back was 20
[24:51] cents then that would mean $200,000 in
[24:54] cards and that's the reason you still
[24:56] find a lot of Myer classic cards around
[24:59] but luckily prices have been coming down
[25:02] also because there's more of these
[25:04] systems asking for ultr light C cards
[25:06] and so they've become cheap enough to
[25:08] the point where hotels are now using
[25:10] ultral light
[25:12] C so I guess most of the people in this
[25:14] room are staying at a hotel this week so
[25:16] how can you tell if the hotel you're
[25:18] staying at is using saf loock and if
[25:20] it's fixed or
[25:21] not it's relatively easy to see if um
[25:25] hotel is using saf loock typically you
[25:27] can only tell when you're checking in in
[25:28] if you look over the counter you can see
[25:30] the encoders so we have two pictures of
[25:34] encoders on the slide here um the
[25:35] leftmost one is an old encoder it's it's
[25:38] thicker it's bigger and the one on the
[25:41] right is a new one now if you see the
[25:43] old one you know it's a vulnerable
[25:45] system if you see the new one it could
[25:48] be a fixed system or it can be a system
[25:50] that is in the progress of being
[25:51] mitigated to the new
[25:53] solution you can also quickly recognize
[25:56] the locks that are used in these system
[25:58] so the the small black p type lock with
[26:02] the S going to it is very common here um
[26:05] and and those are saf lock locks so if
[26:07] you see those you know it's a saf lock
[26:10] system then the next thing you can do is
[26:13] you get a card from um when checking in
[26:15] you can tell if it's a Myer classic or
[26:17] an ult light C
[26:19] card so then you use your your favorite
[26:21] RFID tool which we all know is the
[26:23] flipper zero with Iceman
[26:25] forare or you use an Android phone with
[26:28] NFC tag Info app and that allows you to
[26:30] tell what type of card it
[26:32] is so if it's a Mya classic card then
[26:35] you know that the system is still
[26:36] vulnerable to this attack and or it's
[26:40] not a Stog deployment so you have to
[26:41] really do all three of the
[26:44] steps so how to protect yourself in
[26:47] hotel you see it's saff loock you see
[26:48] it's my classic well you're probably
[26:50] screwed um but there's some things you
[26:53] can buy uh you there's a dbol door bolt
[26:56] deadbolt velcro strap and that kind of
[26:58] holds the dead buol closed and so that
[27:00] kind of prevents it from opening
[27:01] externally um you can also get underd
[27:03] door wedges which kind of drill
[27:04] themselves into a carpet and prevent the
[27:06] door from opening uh obviously there's
[27:08] are kind of hacks but they could be good
[27:09] if you travel a lot and devian has some
[27:11] great videos about hotel security as
[27:13] well and just in general even if you're
[27:15] not staying at a saff loock hotel you
[27:17] know maybe next year there'll be more
[27:18] vulnerabilities
[27:20] so uh so that's it summary reading a
[27:24] single card at a hotel allows us to open
[27:26] any door at the property if it's
[27:27] vulnerable um the system has been in use
[27:30] since 1988 uh you'd say hey they didn't
[27:33] have Myer classic back then and it's
[27:34] true but they did the same thing for Max
[27:36] strip cards so unfortunately it the
[27:39] system has been vulnerable since before
[27:41] Leonard and I were even born
[27:44] uh and you know many aspects of these
[27:47] systems still haven't been looked at
[27:49] once we found a way to you know make
[27:50] these master keys we didn't really care
[27:52] about the rest of it um but there's a
[27:54] wide scope the locks have USB ports the
[27:57] you know there many many aspects to
[27:59] these systems and more vulnerabilities
[28:01] likely exist somewhere um luckily the
[28:03] cost of the secure cards have come down
[28:05] a lot ultra light C desire stuff like
[28:07] that um obviously it's a lot better than
[28:09] using Myer classic which has been broken
[28:11] forever um and overall even though we
[28:13] had to message them on LinkedIn at first
[28:15] we did have a positive experience
[28:16] working with dormakaba they did take it
[28:18] seriously and they didn't sue me so
[28:20] that's always
[28:21] great it's time for a demo
[28:27] [Applause]
[28:34] okay we have two demos are we going to
[28:37] attempt to show two
[28:40] [Music]
[28:46] demos so for the first demo we'll be
[28:48] using the box Mark
[28:52] 3 I have a few RFID cards here um one of
[28:57] them says valid
[28:58] [Music]
[29:02] as you can tell it opens the lock now if
[29:05] someone is staying inside of the room
[29:06] and they have the deadbolt
[29:08] on then this card no longer
[29:12] works so that's a normal behavior of
[29:15] regular guest
[29:18] cards the second card I have says
[29:20] expired or
[29:22] [Music]
[29:26] invelop and that c obviously doesn't
[29:28] work so we assume that this is the cart
[29:31] the attacker finds in the hallway or
[29:32] it's maybe the cart to their
[29:35] room and finally I have the the two
[29:38] attacker cards labeled one and two and
[29:40] just to show you that I'm not cheating
[29:42] for the demo I'll tap these to the lock
[29:44] and show that the loog doesn't
[29:50] open okay so now we'll start by reading
[29:54] the expired or the invalid card with the
[29:56] box mark
[30:02] so what we do here is we take the uid
[30:04] that we read from the card we derive the
[30:06] key for the sectors we read the data
[30:09] from the cart we decrypt it we
[30:11] deserialize it and here we're printing a
[30:13] few of the fields that are stored on the
[30:15] cart so you can see this is a level one
[30:17] card so it's an regular guest key it was
[30:20] made for the for the lead room and you
[30:22] can also see that the cart was created
[30:24] in 1990 and that means the cart is
[30:27] expired and that's why no longer works
[30:28] on this lock now what we really need
[30:30] from this card is the property ID and
[30:34] using this property ID we can now start
[30:35] making new
[30:39] cards so I'll first reprogram the first
[30:45] card so what we're making now is an
[30:48] emergency level resequence card um so
[30:51] that's the the re-sequencing
[30:55] key and the next key we make is an
[30:58] opening
[31:01] key and now we ready to break into hotel
[31:04] rooms I'm going to assume the person
[31:06] that's staying in this room has a
[31:07] deadbolt turned on and then we'll start
[31:09] carrying out the
[31:13] attack so the first key re sequences the
[31:16] lock and essentially enables the second
[31:18] card
[31:19] [Music]
[31:35] and like I mentioned before you can use
[31:37] these two cards over and over again in
[31:39] the same property and open all of the
[31:41] all of the
[31:42] doors now the second demo is essentially
[31:45] the same thing but using the flipper
[31:48] zero I hope it's visible on the
[31:51] screen but the idea is that whatever I'm
[31:53] doing here on the flipper is the same
[31:55] thing as you see on the screen over
[31:56] there so essentially we just go into the
[31:59] NFC
[32:02] menu I'm using the expired card
[32:07] again so I'll read the the expired
[32:16] card it tells us it's a saffo card we we
[32:19] can again see the the card level the
[32:21] property ID the lock ID and that this
[32:24] card was created in the
[32:26] 1990s and in the back ground what this
[32:28] flipper app has done is it has
[32:30] automatically created two extra cards so
[32:34] this first entry is a copy of the card
[32:36] we just read and then the second one is
[32:38] the resequencing key so we can start
[32:40] emulating this
[32:45] one so
[32:48] [Music]
[32:50] now now the lock has been resequenced we
[32:53] go back into the menu we take our
[32:55] opening key we emulate it
[33:02] and it opens
[33:07] [Music]
[33:11] up so thanks everyone for coming to the
[33:14] talk if anyone has questions we'll try
[33:16] to answer them
[33:23] [Applause]
[33:30] I'm too sure for this hello um is that
[33:33] the iceman firmware up there yeah it's a
[33:36] special beta at leas all right okay
[33:40] actual question
[33:42] um you know considering what you said
[33:44] about like the you know the software
[33:46] from dormakaba uh do you think the
[33:48] responsibility lies on dormakaba or like
[33:51] the hotels for how long it's taking them
[33:52] to upgrade their systems thinking about
[33:55] like the the logging and even like the
[33:57] encryption method for the
[33:59] cards it's a good question um we also
[34:03] don't know entirely how D makaba is
[34:05] handling the like resolving or doing the
[34:08] the updates how much of it hotels have
[34:10] to pay how much dakawa pays and so on um
[34:14] I think that the Locking stuff is more
[34:16] an idea we came up with ourselves like
[34:18] our idea was if if the front desk can
[34:20] can see logs of who is entering the
[34:22] rooms and so on then in theory it
[34:24] shouldn't be too difficult to check if
[34:26] someone is using a Rec sequencing card
[34:28] for example and and you could have some
[34:30] alerts to it when when something like
[34:31] that happens okay and then Ian um you
[34:34] know I heard you were a degenerate
[34:35] Gambler are you up or down I think I'm
[34:38] even now are you hell
[34:45] yeah what's going on uh thank you so
[34:48] much for talking about the disclosure
[34:50] process and explaining all the other
[34:52] factors that weigh on timelines and
[34:55] things like that uh it's really
[34:56] important for all the researches to
[34:58] understand that and I think it's
[34:59] wonderful did you find the process of
[35:01] working with them to be smooth the whole
[35:03] time or did was it like Smooth with an
[35:05] executive and then like lawyers like how
[35:08] did that go uh they did ask us to sign
[35:11] an NDA at first but we said no and from
[35:14] there it was pretty good uh I think
[35:17] obviously it was I think one of their
[35:19] first times you know going through this
[35:20] process and so you know we just had to
[35:22] set our our expectations of like you
[35:24] know we're eventually going to disclose
[35:26] this and it needs to be fix and I think
[35:28] once once we all understood that it was
[35:30] it was okay they they never they never
[35:32] threatened to sue us or anything uh so
[35:34] it was never hostile at all cool we're
[35:36] really proud of you thank you guys I'll
[35:38] just add that I think for them it was
[35:40] very new and thanks um and like the
[35:44] picture you see in this slide is
[35:46] actually um a video set that they had at
[35:49] their facilities and on the website on
[35:52] unlock.com we have a small video showing
[35:54] the attack and that video was actually
[35:55] shot at the facility from d
[36:00] thank you to them for
[36:02] that um did you say that the
[36:05] substitution table was the same for
[36:06] every property so you said they replace
[36:08] that with
[36:09] AES um in the enhanced mode it uses AES
[36:13] um I think they made if you're still
[36:14] using the old system 6000 my
[36:16] understanding is it's no longer a
[36:18] substitution table I don't know if it
[36:20] uses AES or um but it it's it's
[36:22] something that's specific to each hotel
[36:23] at least which is better than what they
[36:25] had before that was my question are the
[36:27] keys now specific to each property like
[36:29] or do you know one way or the other but
[36:31] that's our understanding yeah fingers
[36:33] crossed all right thank
[36:36] you hi um so you mentioned when you
[36:39] resequence a lock um it invalidates all
[36:43] of the existing cards with I'm assuming
[36:45] lower sequence numbers does that also
[36:47] happen with the emergency card that you
[36:50] resequence the lock
[36:53] with so I think you were asking about
[36:56] invalidating older cards in sequence
[36:58] numbers right yeah um so the IDE or at
[37:01] least the way we think it works is if
[37:03] you check in at a hotel the sequence
[37:04] gets incremented and once a lock sees a
[37:07] higher sequence number it stop accept
[37:09] stops accepting older sequence numbers
[37:12] and the same thing is probably two fre
[37:13] emergency cards uh but since our first
[37:15] card sort of re sequences the lock and
[37:18] tells it this is now your sequence
[37:19] number we can then use our our lock so
[37:22] the resequencing card can have any
[37:24] sequence number you want so then the
[37:27] older cards that worked on the walk
[37:30] before that will get invalidated as a
[37:32] result I get it so I think you're asking
[37:35] if we do our attack do the guest key
[37:37] cards get invalidated so the sequence is
[37:39] specific to each level so in our attack
[37:41] we're doing the emergency key cards so
[37:42] it would break the emergency key cards
[37:44] for the hotel but the guest Keys would
[37:46] be unaffected
[37:48] um gotcha thank
[37:49] [Applause]
[37:54] you is it possible to Brute Force the
[37:57] property IDs then you wouldn't need
[37:59] another keep in the same
[38:01] Hotel um we could speculate that there's
[38:04] a way to do it I don't know if I would
[38:05] do it via brute foring because it is
[38:07] pretty painful like you have to
[38:08] physically move the device you know
[38:09] across the lock each time um but as I
[38:12] said like the USB port seemed pretty
[38:14] interesting to us and there may be a way
[38:15] to like get that info from it uh we just
[38:17] didn't look at that surface at all
[38:19] really so
[38:22] thanks two questions um one are you
[38:25] staying at Resort World two is Resort
[38:28] World saff loock
[38:30] [Music]
[38:32] hotel I'm sorry I couldn't hear the
[38:35] second one was uh is Resort World a saff
[38:38] loock hotel yeah
[38:41] I we we've both stayed at Resort World
[38:43] and uh we believe it's been fixed there
[38:45] I believe all the cars are ultr see
[38:47] there
[38:50] so so for the uh Legacy encoder that
[38:53] dorov is replacing um it appears that
[38:57] that can also write ultral light C so do
[39:00] you know why they replace that
[39:03] encoder I'm sorry I think the mic is a
[39:05] little low up so I'm having trouble
[39:06] hearing the question sorry sorry I was
[39:08] saying um so for the Legacy encoder that
[39:10] dor maaba is replacing it appears that
[39:12] with the system 6,000 software it can
[39:14] also read and write the ultralight C
[39:16] cards so do you know like what
[39:19] additional security they got by
[39:20] replacing
[39:21] it um they told us that they added a
[39:23] secure element to the new encoder um we
[39:26] didn't we didn't look and they didn't
[39:27] tell us on exactly how that's used um
[39:30] but I think that was part of the reason
[39:32] um I'm not sure if the old encoder
[39:33] support RC or not as well I'm not
[39:36] sure I think the older system supported
[39:39] other
[39:40] cards not just my classic I think they
[39:42] had even support for ultral light for a
[39:44] while and just no one really seemed to
[39:46] use it like all of the saf loog
[39:48] deployments we've seen were Myer classic
[39:50] thank you awesome
[39:53] talk hi I read my photos card and it's
[39:57] not me my fair but it's St chip do you
[40:00] know if it's vable or
[40:02] Not St
[40:04] chip it's quite difficult to understand
[40:06] the questions up here but I have a card
[40:08] with st chip not my fair did you look at
[40:11] those I I haven't looked at any hotels
[40:14] that had St chips in them but maybe
[40:16] Iceman knows about this specific car
[40:20] for I don't know sorry okay thank you
[40:32] he's going to handle
[40:34] us hi I'm IC man I have a question to
[40:39] you h no vestic card is not vulnerable
[40:42] in that sense yes it's true but Jen
[40:45] benam did some work with
[40:47] it awesome [ \_\_ ] research I'm in all
[40:52] by it it's
[40:55] amazing I bow
[40:58] go for de
[41:03] hacking but to be honest it was my fa
[41:06] classic and you did do have net so I
[41:09] think that's cheating I thought you
[41:10] would done more
[41:12] Hardware with that said give them a
[41:15] well-rounded Applause because they are
[41:16] [ \_\_ ]
[41:24] amazing I guess that's it all right
[41:26] thank you so much appreciate it

# Hackers Found a Way to Open Any of 3 Million Hotel Keycard Locks in Seconds

The company behind the Saflok-brand door locks is offering a fix, but it may take months or years to reach some hotels.Play/Pause ButtonPausePHOTO-ILLUSTRATION: WIRED STAFF; GETTY IMAGESSave this storySaveSave this storySave

When thousands of security researchers descend on Las Vegas every August for what's come to be known as “hacker summer camp,” the back-to-back [Black Hat](https://www.wired.com/tag/black-hat/) and [Defcon](https://www.wired.com/tag/defcon/) hacker conferences, it's a given that some of them will experiment with hacking the infrastructure of Vegas itself, the city's elaborate array of [casino](https://www.wired.com/story/card-shuffler-hack/) and [hospitality](https://www.wired.com/story/elevator-phone-phreaking-defcon/) technology. But at one private event in 2022, a select group of researchers were actually *invited* to hack a Vegas hotel room, competing in a suite crowded with their laptops and cans of Red Bull to find digital vulnerabilities in every one of the room's gadgets, from its TV to its bedside VoIP phone.

One team of hackers spent those days focused on the lock on the room's door, perhaps its most sensitive piece of technology of all. Now, more than a year and a half later, they're finally bringing to light the results of that work: a technique they discovered that would allow an intruder to open any of millions of hotel rooms worldwide in seconds, with just two taps.

Today, Ian Carroll, Lennert Wouters, and a team of other security researchers are revealing a hotel keycard hacking technique they call [Unsaflok](https://unsaflok.com/). The technique is a collection of security vulnerabilities that would allow a hacker to almost instantly open several models of Saflok-brand RFID-based keycard locks sold by the Swiss lock maker Dormakaba. The Saflok systems are installed on 3 million doors worldwide, inside 13,000 properties in 131 countries.

By exploiting weaknesses in both Dormakaba's encryption and the underlying RFID system Dormakaba uses, known as MIFARE Classic, Carroll and Wouters have demonstrated just how easily they can open a Saflok keycard lock. Their technique starts with obtaining any keycard from a target hotel—say, by booking a room there or grabbing a keycard out of a box of used ones—then reading a certain code from that card with a $300 RFID read-write device, and finally writing two keycards of their own. When they merely tap those two cards on a lock, the first rewrites a certain piece of the lock's data, and the second opens it.

“Two quick taps and we open the door,” says Wouters, a researcher in the Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography group at the KU Leuven University in Belgium. “And that works on every door in the hotel.”

Wouters and Carroll, an independent security researcher and founder of travel website Seats.aero, shared the full technical details of their hacking technique with Dormakaba in November 2022. Dormakaba says that it's been working since early last year to make hotels that use Saflok aware of their security flaws and to help them fix or replace the vulnerable locks. For many of the Saflok systems sold in the last eight years, there's no hardware replacement necessary for each individual lock. Instead, hotels will only need to update or replace the front desk management system and have a technician carry out a relatively quick reprogramming of each lock, door by door.

Wouters and Carroll say they were nonetheless told by Dormakaba that, as of this month, only 36 percent of installed Safloks have been updated. Given that the locks aren't connected to the internet and some older locks will still need a hardware upgrade, they say the full fix will still likely take months longer to roll out, at the very least. Some older installations may take years.

“We have worked closely with our partners to identify and implement an immediate mitigation for this vulnerability, along with a longer-term solution,” Dormakaba wrote to WIRED in a statement, though it declined to detail what that “immediate mitigation” might be. “Our customers and partners all take security very seriously, and we are confident all reasonable steps will be taken to address this matter in a responsible way.”

The technique to hack Dormakaba's locks that Wouters and Carroll's research group discovered involves two distinct kinds of vulnerabilities: One that allows them to write to its keycards, and one that allows them to know *what* data to write to the cards to successfully trick a Saflok lock into opening. When they analyzed Saflok keycards, they saw that they use the MIFARE Classic RFID system, which has been known for more than a decade to have vulnerabilities that allow hackers to write to keycards, though the brute-force process can take as long as 20 seconds. They then cracked a part of Dormakaba's own encryption system, its so-called key derivation function, which allowed them to write to its cards far faster. With either of those tricks, the researchers could then copy a Saflok keycard at will, but still not generate one for a different room.

The researchers' more crucial step required them to obtain one of the lock programming devices that Dormakaba distributes to hotels, as well as a copy of its front desk software for managing keycards. By reverse engineering that software, they were able to understand all the data stored on the cards, pulling out a hotel property code as well as a code for each individual room, then create their own values and encrypt them just as Dormakaba's system would, allowing them to spoof a working master key that opens any room on the property. “You can make a card that really looks as if it was created by the software from Dormakaba, essentially,” says Wouters.

And how did Carroll and Wouters obtain Dormakaba's front desk software? “We nicely asked a few people,” Wouters says. “Manufacturers assume that no one will sell their equipment on eBay, and that no one will make a copy of their software, and those assumptions, I think everyone knows, are not really valid.”

Once they'd managed all that reverse engineering work, the final version of their attack could be pulled off with little more than a $300 Proxmark RFID read-write device and a couple of blank RFID cards, an Android phone, or a [Flipper Zero radio hacking tool](https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-flipper-zero-tiktok/).

The biggest caveat to the hackers' Unsaflok technique is that it still requires that they have a keycard—even an expired one—for a room somewhere in the same hotel as the room they're targeting. That's because each card has a property-specific code they need to read and then duplicate on their spoofed card, as well as a room-specific one.

Once they have that property code, the technique also requires using an RFID read-write device to write two cards—one card that reprograms a target lock as well as the second spoofed card that unlocks it. (An Android phone or a Flipper Zero could also be used to emit one signal after another instead of the two cards, the researchers say.) The researchers hint that the first card allows them to open a target room without guessing its unique identifier in the hotel's system, but declined to say exactly what that first card does. They're holding that element of the technique in confidence to avoid giving too clear a set of instructions to would-be intruders or thieves.

By contrast, one security researcher presented a similar hotel keycard hack that [opened locks sold by the firm Onity](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2012/07/23/hacker-will-expose-potential-security-flaw-in-more-than-four-million-hotel-room-keycard-locks/?sh=78d51b9eeb85) at the Black Hat conference in 2012 with no such obfuscation, and allowed any hacker to build a device that opened any of Onity's 10 million locks worldwide. When Onity refused to pay for the hardware upgrades necessary to solve the problem and instead put the onus on its customers, the issue remained unfixed in many hotels—and eventually was exploited in at least [one hacker's cross-country burglary spree](https://www.wired.com/2017/08/the-hotel-hacker/).

Carroll and Wouters say that they're trying to avoid that scenario by taking a more cautious approach, while still warning the public about their technique, given that hundreds of properties will likely remain vulnerable to it even now that Dormakaba has offered its fix. “We're trying to find the middle ground of helping Dormakaba to fix it quickly, but also telling the guests about it," says Carroll. “If someone else reverse engineers this today and starts exploiting it before people are aware, that might be an even bigger problem.”

To that end, Carroll and Wouters point out that hotel guests can recognize the vulnerable locks most often—but not always—by their distinct design: a round RFID reader with a wavy line cutting through it. They suggest that if hotel guests do have a Saflok on their door, they can determine if it's been updated by checking their keycard with the NFC Taginfo app by NXP, available for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nfc-taginfo-by-nxp/id1246143596) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nxp.taginfolite&hl=en_US&gl=US). If the lock is manufactured by Dormakaba, and that app shows that the keycard is still a MIFARE Classic card, it's likely still vulnerable.

If that's the case, the two researchers say, there's not much to do other than avoid leaving valuables in the room and, when you're inside, bolt the chain on the door. They warn that the deadbolt on the room is also controlled by the keycard lock, so it doesn't provide an extra safeguard. “If someone locks the deadbolt, they’re still not protected,” says Carroll.

Even without a perfect or fully implemented fix, Wouters and Carroll argue, it's better for hotel guests to know the risks than to have a false sense of security. After all, they point out, the Saflok brand has been sold for more than three decades, and may have been vulnerable for much or all of those years. Though Dormakaba says it's not aware of any past use of Wouters and Carroll's technique, the researchers point out that doesn't mean it never happened in secret.

“We think the vulnerability has been there for a long time,” says Wouters. “It's unlikely that we are the first to find this.”
