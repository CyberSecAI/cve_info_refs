Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the Unsaflok vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from multiple weaknesses in dormakaba's Saflok electronic RFID lock system, including:
    *   Use of the easily compromised MIFARE Classic RFID system.
    *   A weak key derivation function (KDF) that relies only on the card's UID.
    *   A static substitution table used for encrypting card data, which is the same for all installations.
    *   Lack of proper authentication and authorization mechanisms that allows for lock resequencing with a specially crafted card.
    *   Offline nature of locks that rely on keycards rather than constant server connection, making them vulnerable to resequencing attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Weak Encryption:** The use of a simple substitution cipher for card data encryption allowed for easy decryption and modification of the card data.
*  **Insecure Key Derivation:**  The key derivation function is based solely on the card's UID, making it easy to derive keys.
*   **Replay Attacks:** The system is vulnerable to replay attacks through the use of resequencing cards, which effectively resets the lock's sequence and combination values.
*   **Offline Architecture:** The offline nature of the locks means that they rely on the keycards for authorization and decision making, making them more vulnerable.
*   **Vulnerable RFID System**: The use of MIFARE Classic cards, which have known vulnerabilities that allow for writing card data.
*   **Lack of proper Access Control:** The use of the same substitution table for all installations allowed the researchers to decrypt and modify any Saflok keycard.
*   **Deadbolt Override:** The deadbolt is software controlled and can be overridden with a specially crafted keycard.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain access to any room within a property using a single pair of forged keycards.
*   **Bypass Security:** The attack bypasses the deadbolt, offering no protection to guests using it.
*  **Widespread Impact:** Millions of locks across thousands of properties are affected.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **RFID Manipulation:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the MIFARE Classic RFID system to read and write card data.
*   **Keycard Cloning and Forging:** Attackers can read a keycard, clone it, and create forged keycards that can unlock any door in the hotel using resequencing techniques.
*   **Software Exploitation:** Attackers use reverse-engineered front-desk software to obtain hotel-specific data required to generate forged keycards.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to a property using the vulnerable locks.
*   **RFID Device:** The attacker needs an RFID read-write device, such as a Proxmark3, Flipper Zero or an NFC enabled Android phone, to interact with keycards.
*   **Hotel Keycard:** The attacker needs one keycard from the property, which can be their own, an expired one or one found in the express checkout box.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand the card data structure and be able to decrypt, modify and encrypt the data to forge keycards.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability has been present since at least 1988, when the system was first introduced with magstripe locks.
*   The attack involves a two-step process using two specially crafted keycards to open any door in a property.
*   The full fix involves a software update to the front-desk management system, reprogramming the locks, and reissuing all keycards.
