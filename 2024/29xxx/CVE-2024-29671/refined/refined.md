The provided content relates to CVE-2024-29671.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `formStaticDHCP` function of the `boa` web server. This occurs because the length of the `hostname` parameter in a POST request is not validated before being copied into a fixed-size buffer using `strcpy()`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The lack of bounds checking when copying the `hostname` parameter using `strcpy` allows an attacker to overwrite the stack, including the return address.
- Use of an old and insecure webserver: The router uses a very old version of the `boa` webserver, which was last released in 2005, making it prone to vulnerabilities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): By overwriting the return address on the stack, an attacker can redirect execution to malicious code, resulting in arbitrary code execution with root privileges.
- Denial of Service (DoS): A buffer overflow can cause the affected process (boa webserver) to crash, resulting in a DoS.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted POST request to `/boafrm/formStaticDHCP` containing an overly long `hostname` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable router's web interface (port 443 in this instance).
- Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and parameter (`/boafrm/formStaticDHCP` and `hostname`).
- Ability to craft a malicious payload: The attacker needs to be able to craft an exploit to overwrite the return address and inject shellcode.
