### @Crispy-fried-chicken **[Crispy-fried-chicken](/Crispy-fried-chicken)** commented [Feb 3, 2024](#issue-2116516540)

The `init_die` and `parse_die` function implemented in [dwarf.c](https://github.com/radareorg/radare2/blob/master/libr/bin/dwarf.c) is quite similiar to those in the [rizin](https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin). Thus, it's very likely that Heap-based OOB write in [CVE-2021-43814](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43814) also affects [radare2](https://github.com/radareorg/radare2).

Here is the [patch](https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/commit/aa6917772d2f32e5a7daab25a46c72df0b5ea406?diff=split&w=1) for [CVE-2021-43814](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43814) is provided.

Similar to [rizin](https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin), there is a heap-based out of bounds write in parse\_die when reversing an amd64 elf binary with dwarf debug info, respectively.

Try to fix it based on the patch for [CVE-2021-43814](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43814)

Sorry, something went wrong.

Is there a reproducer for this bug? Ideally it will be good to have it, as part of the fuzz suite, at least to confirm that bug doesnt appears or can be reproduced at least

I also think so, but the commit which fix the vulnerability [CVE-2021-43814](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43814) add this line. Maybe I can delete it ?

As for the reproducer, I don't run it, but the testcase in the patch of CVE-2021-43814 which is [rizinorg/rizin@aa69177?diff=split&w=1](https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/commit/aa6917772d2f32e5a7daab25a46c72df0b5ea406?diff=split&w=1) may determin that this CVE exists, so maybe you can fix it by merge the PR?
