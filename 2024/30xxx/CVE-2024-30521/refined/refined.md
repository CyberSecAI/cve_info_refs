- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Landingi Landing Pages WordPress plugin does not properly implement CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the lack of CSRF protection, which allows an attacker to forge requests that a legitimate, authenticated user's browser will unknowingly execute.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions within the WordPress application. The specific impact will vary on a case-by-case basis, depending on the actions the plugin allows and the privileges of the targeted user.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted malicious request that is triggered when an authenticated user visits a malicious site or interacts with a malicious link/resource. The attacker relies on the user already having an active session within the vulnerable WordPress plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the capability to craft malicious HTML or JavaScript to exploit the CSRF vulnerability. They do not need to be authenticated on the victim's WordPress instance. The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting their malicious page or interacting with a malicious request.
