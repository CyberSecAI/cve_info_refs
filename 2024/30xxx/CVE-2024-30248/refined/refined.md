Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Piccolo's admin panel handles SVG file uploads. When an SVG file is uploaded and viewed inline within the admin panel, the browser executes any embedded JavaScript within that SVG. This execution happens within the context of the authenticated admin session.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Content Security Policy (CSP):** The primary weakness is the absence of a restrictive CSP for media files, particularly SVG files. This allows the browser to execute arbitrary JavaScript embedded within the SVG.
*   **Insecure Handling of SVG Files:**  The admin panel allows the upload of SVG files and renders them inline without proper sanitization or security measures.
*   **Missing Content-Disposition Header:** The application doesn't force the browser to download the SVG instead of rendering it. This allows the malicious code inside the SVG to execute.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker can:

*   **Gain Access to All Data:** Access all data stored within the admin panel.
*   **Perform Arbitrary Actions:** Create, modify, or delete table records and perform any other action an admin user could perform.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Send data to an attacker-controlled server.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Execute arbitrary Javascript within an admin user's session

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** An attacker uploads a malicious SVG file via a media upload form within the admin panel.
*   **Inline Viewing:** The attacker or a legitimate user views the uploaded SVG file inline through the admin panel by clicking the file. This triggers the JavaScript in the SVG.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Admin Access (Initially):**  The most straightforward attack requires initial access to an admin account to upload the malicious file, although the report also suggests it could be possible via a user with file upload privileges.
*   **Basic Knowledge of SVG and JavaScript:** The attacker needs to create an SVG file containing malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application over the network.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The provided PoC demonstrates basic XSS and data exfiltration using malicious SVG payloads.
*   **Affected Versions:** <= 1.2.0
*   **Patched Versions:** 1.3.2
*   **Mitigation:** The commit log shows the fix involves adding CSP headers to media routes, using `CSPMiddleware` and setting `default_src` to `none` which prevents the execution of JavaScript and other inline resources.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.7, which indicates a high severity.

In summary, this is a serious vulnerability where a malicious SVG file, uploaded through a feature intended for media, could give an attacker full control over the admin interface. The fix involves implementing CSP to restrict the rendering of the malicious code.
