Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a business logic flaw in InfluxDB.
*   `allAccess` tokens, by default, have the permission to list all authorizations within the same organization, regardless of the token type (custom, allAccess, or operator). This is due to the permission `read:orgs/<org_id>/authorizations`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A user with an `allAccess` token can list all authorization tokens, including operator tokens, within the same organization.
*   **Lack of Type-Based Restriction:** The system does not restrict listing of tokens based on their type.
*   **Excessive Permissions:** The `allAccess` token has excessive permissions allowing it to read other authorization tokens.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unrestricted Access:** An attacker can gain unrestricted access to the InfluxDB instance by obtaining an operator token.
*   **Compromised Data:** Confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data across different organizations can be compromised.
*   **Full Instance Control:** An attacker with an operator token can compromise the entire InfluxDB instance due to administrative privileges associated with it.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **API Access:** Exploitation can occur via InfluxDB APIs using a custom script that leverages an allAccess token.
*   **CLI Access:** Exploitation can occur using the InfluxDB CLI by listing all tokens and filtering by those with `write:/orgs` permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid `allAccess` Token:** The attacker must possess a valid `allAccess` token.
*   **Same Organization:** The `allAccess` token must have been created within the same organization where an operator token resides.
*   **InfluxDB Interaction:** The attacker must be able to interact with the InfluxDB instance via CLI or APIs.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided information includes a PoC script (`influxdbPrivescCVE_PoC_Script.py`) and instructions to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.1 with a vector of AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H.
*   Temporary mitigation strategies are suggested like creating multiple organizations and not storing operator tokens in non-default organizations.
