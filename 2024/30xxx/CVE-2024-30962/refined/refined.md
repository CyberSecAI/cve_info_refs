{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `AmclNode::convertMap` function in `nav2_amcl` iterates through the map data using `map->size_x * map->size_y` as the boundary, but the actual length of the input `map_msg.data` vector can be less than this calculated size. This discrepancy leads to a heap-buffer-overflow when accessing `map_msg.data` out of bounds.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-buffer-overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when accessing map data.",
      "Lack of input validation on message size before processing it."
    ],
    "impact": "A heap-buffer-overflow can cause the `nav2_amcl` node to crash, potentially disrupting the navigation system.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious or faulty node publishing a malformed `/map` message with a data array smaller than the expected size. The attack vector is through ROS2 topics within the local network.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to publish messages to the `/map` topic. This implies having access to the ROS2 network the robot is connected to."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The provided content includes a detailed bug report, code snippets, discussion around the vulnerability, and the fix that was implemented. It highlights the need for message validation in ROS2 systems. The suggested fix involves adding a `nav2_util/validate_messages.hpp` to implement message validation and using these methods in callbacks to reject invalid messages. The issue was resolved by implementing a message validation check in `nav2_util` and using this check in `nav2_amcl` to avoid the heap-buffer-overflow. The vulnerability was fixed in pull request #4276, which can be reviewed to understand the fix in detail."
