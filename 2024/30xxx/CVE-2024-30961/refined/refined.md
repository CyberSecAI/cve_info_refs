{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `SimpleActionServer` in `nav2_util` throws an exception during deactivation, leading to premature exit and use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability due to a race condition.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-After-Free (UAF)",
      "Race condition",
      "Improper error handling",
        "Lack of synchronization when shutting down"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can cause a crash due to accessing freed memory.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered during the shutdown phase of the navigation2 system.",
          "Sending goals and cancelling them just before shutting down the system"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to send actions to the nav2 system and then abruptly terminate the system."
  },
    "resolution": "The vulnerability was resolved by replacing the `throw error` with an `error-log` in the `SimpleActionServer::deactivate()` function, and adding a nullptr-check in nav2_humble to prevent potential bad function call error"
}
