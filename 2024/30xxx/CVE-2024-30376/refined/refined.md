- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application loads Qt plugins from an unsecured location, which can be manipulated by an attacker.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Uncontrolled search path element, leading to local privilege escalation. Specifically, the application's insecure loading of Qt plugins is the weakness.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of an administrator.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access. An attacker needs the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system. They must also be able to place malicious Qt plugins in the unsecured location where the application loads them. The user must also interact with the application.
