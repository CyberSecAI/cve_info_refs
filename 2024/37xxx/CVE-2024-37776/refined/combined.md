dcTrack 9.2.0 Release Notes

 1

Compliance with Security Technical Implementation Guide: To pass as many of the rules as possible
that are part of the DISA STIG for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 V1R14, the underlying Linux operating
system has been updated to version 8.10, many components have been updated to current versions,
and additional hardening steps are applied during both ISO install and upgrade to release 9.2.0.

Content-Security-Policy enhancement: To keep the solution as secure as possible, dcTrack will return a
more restrictive Content-Security-Policy header than in past releases.  In future releases, the Content-
Security-Policy will continue to be tightened.  However, for customers who allow HTML widgets in the
dashboard, there will not be any change to the Content-Security-Policy response header compared to
prior versions of dcTrack.

Removal of support for TLS 1.2: As per the deprecation notice provided in the dcTrack 9.0.0 and dcTrack
9.1.0 release notes, Sunbird has removed support for TLS 1.2 to keep the solution as secure as possible.
Only key ciphers that support "Forward Secrecy" are enabled. This follows the recommended best
practice from OWASP and other security organizations. For customers that have internal applications
that integrate with dcTrack through our HTTPS public APIs, they should investigate if this will introduce
complexities that cannot be easily mitigated.  If so, please reach out to Sunbird support and Sunbird will

work with you to ease the transition.

Removal of support for Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) HTTPS certificates: NIST has deprecated the
use of this algorithm because it is no longer considered secure. If a customer is currently using such a
certificate, the appliance will continue to use it for securing HTTPS traffic.  However, users can no longer
upload such certificates via the web UI.

New Features and Enhancements

The following features are new or enhanced in dcTrack version 9.2.0. For more detailed information and
instructions, please refer to the dcTrack User Guide.

Hierarchal Floor Maps

dcTrack version 9.2.0 introduces Hierarchal Floor Maps. This feature allows you to render multiple
Rooms on a single drawing using either AutoCAD (dwg) or Visio (vsdx) file formats. This enhancement
enables you to visualize an entire floor that contains multiple rooms and utilize all the floor map
features while viewing all the rooms of that floor.

Enhanced Floor Map Editing

A new Edit button has been added to the Floor Map Tool Bar that provides additional editing
capabilities. While in Edit mode you can now Drag and Drop free standing objects, add new objects,
place objects at any angle, Rotate and Resize. The Sync feature has been moved to the new edit toolbar.
Additionally, if you are using Hierarchical Floor maps using the Edit feature, you can assign individual
rooms by drawing or editing their boundaries, as well as specifying the position of the Grid Marker.

Manage Floor Map Permissions

A new role “Manage Floor Maps” is now available in dcTrack. This role can be assigned globally or locally
at the Location level. Users with this role can upload/download drawings, access the new Edit Button,
(provided the user has permissions to add or edit items) as well as all other features that were
previously limited to Administrators and Gatekeepers.

Multi-fiber Push On (MPO) Connectors

dcTrack 9.2.0 improves support for one-to-many circuits using MPO connectors. Models and Items Data
Ports and Rack PDU Outlet Ports will now have a channel attribute. Model Ports get the Channel value
from the Connector. Item Ports will inherit Channels from Models. These Channels allow a single port to
have multiple connections. On upgrade, all existing connectors and ports will have one channel and can
be overridden at either the Model or Item levels. Both Models and Items Channel value will be editable.

Announcement Banner

In dcTrack 9.2.0, administrators can configure and display a company-specific announcement banner.
You can use the banner to display messages for every logged in user. The supports one or two lines of
text and appears directly above the dcTrack Main Menu. You can configure the Banner to display
messages and hyperlinks using colors selected by you.

Password and Authentication Enhancements for Local Accounts

dcTrack 9.2.0 enables administrators to configure an account lock-out feature based on incorrect
password attempts. You can configure the number of failed attempts a user is given before they are
locked out of the system. You can also configure whether the Account should be unlocked after a pre-
defined period or must be unlocked by an Administrator.

Tooltips for Standard and Custom Fields

Administrators can now define custom Tooltips for both Standard and Custom fields in dcTrack. Once a
tooltip is set for a field, the tooltip will display whenever a user hovers over a field's label on its related
detail page. Tooltips are set in the Field Properties subtab of the Field Management feature.

Passive Class Items Included in the Items list with their own Item Details Pages

Passive Class Items which were previously within the Cabinet detail page, now have their own Item
Details page. These Items will now appear in the Items List and can be managed just like any other Item
Class in dcTrack. The Passive class continues the same functionality for its subclasses: Shelf and Blanking
Plate, however, the “Standard” subclass has been renamed to “General”.

Estimated Patch Cord Length Within A Cabinet

Patch Cord Lengths will now be automatically calculated when adding/editing Data and Power Circuits.
Whenever a Connection is made between two nodes that are in the same cabinet, dcTrack will
automatically calculate the minimum required Patch Cord Length. The calculated length will appear as a
message in the footer of the Cord Detail page and set as the field default value. Calculated lengths can
be overridden if necessary and the overridden value will be retained as the actual cord length, however
the calculated length will always display as a message at the bottom of the page. You can also view the
total circuit length as part of the circuit trace by toggling the Show/Hide button on the tool bar.

Identify Planned vs Installed Circuits

The Circuit Trace in dcTrack 9.2.0 has been enhanced to display an icon as part of the information panel
that appears at the beginning of each circuit. The icon will display a “P” for planned circuits and an “I”
for installed circuits. Clicking on the Icon will open the Circuit Detail dialog box for the Circuit.

Enhanced Integration of Rack UPS and Rack Transfer Switch

dcTrack 9.2.0 implements the complete integration for Rack UPS and Rack Transfer Switches with Power
IQ. Rack UPS when integrated with Power IQ will now get additional readings for the UPS load and
readings for the battery. Integrated Rack Transfer Switch will retrieve the Active and Preferred Inlets and
update the active and preferred inlets for the Rack PDU in dcTrack.

Enhanced ServiceNow Integration (Note: This feature is not available at this time
and is pending ServiceNow certification and possibly another dcTrack software
update.)

dcTrack version 9.2.0 has enhanced its CMDB integration with ServiceNow. In addition to its current
ability to integrate with ServiceNow Hardware Assets, the ServiceNow Connector will now also integrate
with ServiceNow CI tables. This integration supports bi-directional Inserts and Updates of mapped fields
between dcTrack and ServiceNow as well as support for CI Relationships. In addition to the CI support,
the ServiceNow Connector can now create missing Models on ServiceNow when a new item is pushed to
ServiceNow, making it easier to normalize Models between dcTrack and ServiceNow. Please note in
order to take advantage of these enhancements, you must be on dcTrack version 9.2.0 and the latest
version of the Sunbird dcTrack CMDB Connector (version 1.2.0) available from the ServiceNow App
store.

Create Data Ports Without Structured Cabling

dcTrack 9.2.0 will now allow users to create Data Ports on Data Panel Items and Models without
structured cabling being required. Items created from these Models will inherit the Port information
along with the Port Placement from the Model. The Data Ports Subtab in the Data Panel Item details
page now includes a Create Ports button in addition to the existing Create Structured Cabling button
allowing you to manage the Data Ports at the Item level as well. The Create Structured Cabling page has
also been enhanced to contain a new field under both the near end and far end UI panels allowing you
to select the Ports for each. Data panel ports that don't have structured cabling will appear in the list of
available ports when building a circuit allowing these ports to now be connected.

Total Quantity instead of Quantity per Cabinet in Intelligent Capacity Search.

dcTrack 9.2 enhance Intelligent Capacity Search to return results based on the total quantity of an item
that you want to add to your data center, instead of the quantity per cabinet. The search returns all the
cabinets where the items can be placed. You can then select your preferred placement method.

Hide Widgets that Are Not Useful to Your Users

dcTrack 9.2.0 enables administrators and gatekeepers to hide widgets by moving the widgets to a new
"Hidden" dashboard, which displays at the bottom of the Standard folder list in the Dashboards tab. If
you have sufficient permissions, you can move widgets in and out of this dashboard as with any other
dashboard. Users with sufficient permissions continue to see empty dashboards so that they can move
widget back into these dashboards. When you are logged in as a user who does not have sufficient
permissions, the Hidden Dashboard as well as any empty Dashboard will not be displayed.

Bulk Scanning for Loading Dock Receiving into Storage

dcTrack 9.2.0 enhances the Bulk Scanning feature to enable data center loading dock operators to
rapidly scan the barcodes/QR-codes of serial number, asset tag or both and create new items from each.
All scanned items must be of the same make and model and share the same values for a few select
fields, such as PO Number, Project Number, Customer.

Power Chain Enhancements

dcTrack 9.2.0 enhances the power chain with support for 100 and 200 Volts for VPC Circuits (Common in
Japan). Certain Facility Items will now support 27,600 Volts and 347/600 V was added for Transformers
(Common in Canada).

Public API updates

•

In the next release, dcTrack will change the way that data is returned for any public API that
does not adhere to our current standard of not returning a property if its value is
empty/null. This does not mean that the field is being removed, we are only removing it from
the payload if it provides no benefit since its value is null. Please consult the documentation to
confirm the meaning for any field that could be in the payload if it has a non-null value. Most
APIs already adhere to this standrd.

•  Several fields and endpoints for public APIs have been removed or are marked as deprecated in
9.2.0, please read the additional comments section carefully and assess the impact of these
changes in your environment.  In case of any questions/concerns, please reach out to Sunbird
technical support.

•  A new public API endpoint has been added to support PATCH operation on /v2/models.  Please

refer to the online API documentation for additional details.

•  A new public API has been added to allow users to search audit trail records at

/api/v2/quicksearch/auditTrail. Please refer to the online API documentation for additional
details.

•  API calls that take longer than five minutes to complete will be timed out by the server.  Note

that /bulk/asynch endpoints are asynchronous, so will continue to be processed for longer than
five minutes.

The Administrator role is renamed System Administrator in dcTrack

This API performs as a PUT and not a PATCH. For example, if the
Request includes the dataPorts list but nothing inside it, the data
ports will be removed, or you include a new port in the list , but not
the current port on the device, it will remove the port that already
exists and create a new port.
This was done to improve performance.  Users with sufficient
permissions can modify the widget settings as needed to meet their
requirements.

A new public API /v2/dcimoperations/requests has been added
which includes the existing functionality

On upgrade, dcTrack will automatically replace deprecated field
names with their replacement.  However, if a customer had saved
an XML configuration from an older release and tried to apply to
apply it in 9.1.0, it would no longer be valid if it contains the
deprecated field names.
The CRACGroupItemID column was deprecated in dcTrack 9.1 and
will be removed in version 9.3.0  Use “dcCoolingUnitsToZones“
going forward .  See the online documentation for more details.

Custom field definitions are not exported for locations and models

A user cannot connect a right partial circuit into a full circuit from a
data panel’s item details page. The circuit can be connected from
the Circuits List.
The audit trail records measurements in "units" in US units
regardless of the user’s preferences. For example, when SI (Metric)
is selected in the user’s Unit System preference in the user profile,
the value displayed is not calculated/converted correctly.

A Jetty server does not start correctly when a SAML server is
configured with metadata copied from a Firefox browser because
Firefox does not parse and render the XML correctly. Do not use
Firefox to get the metadata, instead use Edge or Chrome.
The following characters are not supported in custom field labels: a
period "." and a single quote " ' ". Using these characters in your
custom fields labels may result in errors or missing information
when using the APIs.
This syntax for providing external links based on user specified
search criteria is deprecated in dcTrack 9.1.0.
When a user uploads a Models Library Update file (.mlu) to dcTrack,
if a standard or network device model in the file matches a model in
the user's library and the "Do Not Update" option for the model is
false, the ports in the MLU file will overwrite the ports in the user’s
library regardless of whether the ports were modified by the user.
Note: For Rack PDU power ports, if the user modified any port, all
power ports will be considered modified and no ports will be added
from the MLU file.

/v2/quicksearch/ API

This field is deprecated in dcTrack 9.1.0

dcTrack 9.2.0 Release Notes

tiAddressFloor field in the
/v1/locations API

This field is deprecated in dcTrack 9.1.0

An API call with a trailing slash
(/) at the end of the URL does
not work.

Saving an Item with SNMP3
enabled

Importing Busways

The url for external links
https://<dcTrackIPAddress>/li
nk/search/{fieldname}/{value}
has been deprecated.
HA Email configuration is
initially disabled.

dcTrack in Multiple tabs

ODBC access may require new
drivers

Import over 100k rows

An API call with a trailing slash (/) at the end of the URL does not
work.  If the user calls a URL with a trailing slash, it will not work, for
example:

•  Working in 9.1.0: POST /api/v1/items
•  No longer working in 9.1.0 or later: POST /api/v1/items/, or

api/v1//items

Users may receive the message "SNMP V3 Authorization Level is
invalid" when saving an Item with SNMP3 enabled even if the
settings have not changed. To correct the problem, select a different
Authorization Level from the dropdown then select the original
option again and the record will successfully save.
Busway Outlets can no longer be created when importing Busway
Breakers. The Power Outlet column in the file must refer to an
existing column.
Additionally, when creating Power Outlets for Busways, the Busway
column is required. As a result, the Busway must be created prior to
importing their Power Outlets.

The new format is:
https://<dcTrackIPAddress>/link/search/items?field=XXX&value=YY
Y

To enable the configuration: Toggle the “Enable High Availability”
check box checked > unchecked > checked.
If you have dcTrack open in multiple tabs, closing one or more of
those tabs may cause your session to end in all the remaining open
tabs.
The version of the database has been upgraded from PostgreSQL 9.6
to PostgreSQL 12.1.  Customers who access the database via ODBC
may need to update the database drivers used.

Importing files in excel format having more than 100K rows my
cause an issue and import will fail. Use csv format when importing
files over 100k rows.

ODBC Query Timeout

To change the ODBC Query Timeout setting, you must restart the
dcTrack appliance. Otherwise, the setting will remain unchanged
until the next time the dcTrack appliance is restarted.

Rendering 3D Floor Maps on a
Mobile Device

The mobile browser may fail to load the 3D Visualization. To get
around this issue, from a desktop browser, set the Contents Selector
in the 3D Settings tab under the Floor Map Settings section to Auto
rather than Always. This setting will only affect your user account.
Alternatively, you may login to dcTrack by requesting the
Visualization directly by typing this URL into your mobile browser:
<dctrack hostname>/dcim/#/visualization

API Move Requests on
Cabinets

Custom Date fields do not
work in the color-code feature
on the floor map.

A facility item’s Input Rating
(Vac) does not update when its
Input Item’s Rating (Vac) value
is updated.

A UPS is not displayed in the
"UPS Units in Bank grid on the
Configuration sub-tab. Units in
Bank YYY" grid of a UPS Bank if
the UPS is placed in a different
location

A Power Panel’s Breaker
Voltage does not update when
the Fed-From item’s Rating
(Vac) value is updated.

When using API move requests on cabinets and manipulating the
rows of the original item or the ^^when moved item, there may be a
leftover system row with a name ending in ^^MOV, after completing
the move. This is a known issue, and the row can be safely deleted.

On the floor map, for the color-code feature, colors are not grouped
by month for date type fields.

After creating a Utility Feed and specifying its Rating (Vac) value and
setting it as the Input item for a transformer, users may find that the
Transformer Input Rating (Vac) does not change when the Input
item’s Rating (Vac) value is updated. To fix: Delete the Fed-From
item field in the Transformer and save your change. Then add the
Fed-From Item back to the Transformer and save your changes.

When a UPS is placed in one location, and the UPS bank and its load
device are placed in another location, the UPS does not display in
the UPS Units in Bank grid of the UPS bank.

After creating a Utility Feed and specifying its Rating (Vac) value,
then setting it as the Fed-From item for a Power Panel, users may
find that the voltages of breakers added to the Power Panel do not
change when the Fed-From item’s Rating (Vac) value is updated. To
address this issue: Delete the Fed-From Item field in the Power
Panel and save your change. Then add the Fed-From Item back to
the Power Panel and save your changes.

 Keith Bott, Service Manager Equipment & Facilities

"With dcTrack we have an up-to-minute picture of capacities in all our data centers in terms of power, space, networking and cooling.

"We use Power IQ to generate monthly energy-trend reports that provide customers with actual usage levels by server and IT device….it enables us to provide our customers the ability to run their own reports and to securely power cycle their equipment via a Web interface. Our customers [are] able to take a more active role in managing their servers and their energy utilization."

 Dustin Phillips, Co-Location Operations

"There is a need to increase efficiency through technology...data center infrastructure management tools like dcTrack help you with power management, capacity planning and change management. System monitoring tools help you track the health of the network."

 Tan Choon Huat, Manager of Regional Data Center Facilities
 ![](https://www.sunbirddcim.com/sites/default/files/styles/company_logo/public/AXA.jpg?itok=UyoRbRTS)

"The largest improvement that I see is being able to monitor power usage in our lab and making sure that our PDUs don’t get overloaded. We’ve gone through a few retirement phases and we can track that with the graphs in PIQ — we see the power usage going down. Being able to see the temperature throughout our lab is also pivotal."
