- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Highlight Theme versions 1.0.29 and earlier are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The theme lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions on the WordPress site while authenticated.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could craft a malicious link or website that, when visited by an authenticated user, would trigger the execution of unwanted actions on the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user with sufficient privileges to visit the malicious link or website.
