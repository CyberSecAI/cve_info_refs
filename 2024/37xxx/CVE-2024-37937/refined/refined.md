{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Rara Business theme for WordPress lacks proper CSRF protection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions on the WordPress site, using the victim's current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "A successful CSRF attack requires a malicious actor to trick a logged-in user into clicking on a specially crafted link or visiting a malicious website that performs actions on the vulnerable WordPress site.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated; they must trick an authenticated user into performing an action."
