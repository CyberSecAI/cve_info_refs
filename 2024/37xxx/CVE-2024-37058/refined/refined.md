The provided document contains a vulnerability report from HiddenLayer that details multiple CVEs. Here's the information related to CVE-2024-37058:

**CVE-2024-37058**

*   **Summary:** A deserialization vulnerability exists in the `mlflow/langchain/utils.py` file, specifically within the `_load_from_pickle` function. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject a malicious pickle object into a model file. When this model is loaded, the malicious code is deserialized, leading to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.
*   **Root Cause:** Deserialization of untrusted data using `cloudpickle.load` in the `_load_from_pickle` function.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Unsafe deserialization of pickle objects.
    *   Lack of input sanitization or validation of the serialized data.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    1.  The attacker crafts a malicious `langchain.agents.agent.AgentExecutor` object with specific tools to trigger the vulnerable code path in `_save_base_lcs` within `utils.py`.
    2.  This crafted object is then serialized by `cloudpickle.dump()`
    3.  The malicious model is logged to the MLflow tracking server via `mlflow.langchain.log_model()`.
    4.  When a victim loads the model using `mlflow.langchain.load_model()`, the malicious pickle is deserialized via `_load_from_pickle` , leading to the execution of the injected code.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to create and log a malicious Langchain model to the MLflow tracking server.
    *   The victim needs to load the model from the MLflow server using `mlflow.langchain.load_model()`.
*   **Affected Products:** MLflow version 2.5.0 or greater.
*   **CWE Categorization:** CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data.
*   **CVSS Score:** 8.8
    *   AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**Additional Details:**
