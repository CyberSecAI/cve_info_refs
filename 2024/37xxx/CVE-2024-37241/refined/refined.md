- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WP Job Manager - Resume Manager plugin does not properly validate requests, making it vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack can allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions within the plugin, using their authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves tricking a logged-in user into executing a malicious request on the vulnerable plugin, typically through a link or embedded image.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and lure a logged-in user into unknowingly executing it. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
