- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Events Calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks, allowing malicious actors to potentially force logged-in users with higher privileges to perform unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could lead to unauthorized actions being executed under the context of a higher privileged user, potentially causing various impacts depending on the specific actions the attacker is able to force.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable through a CSRF attack, where a malicious actor tricks a logged-in user into unknowingly submitting a request that performs unauthorized actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated, but needs to trick an authenticated, higher privileged user into triggering the crafted request.
