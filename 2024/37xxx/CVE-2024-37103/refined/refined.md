- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Education Zone Theme for WordPress, in versions 1.3.4 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The theme lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to potentially execute unwanted actions on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to perform actions they did not intend. The specific impact varies depending on the actions available.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, performs an unintended action within the WordPress site. This typically involves tricking a logged-in user into clicking a link or loading a page that sends the malicious request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated user into sending a crafted request. This often involves social engineering or injecting the malicious request into a page or link that the user might visit or click on. The attacker does not need to be authenticated themselves.
