- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Preschool and Kindergarten Theme, in versions up to and including 1.2.1, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The theme lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to potentially force higher-privileged users to perform unintended actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow a malicious actor to force authenticated users to execute unwanted actions, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications or actions on the website.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor could craft a request that, when triggered by a logged-in user, would execute actions on the vulnerable site without the user's knowledge or consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into executing a crafted request. This does not require direct access to the server or WordPress dashboard itself.
