{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The JobScout theme for WordPress lacks proper protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions on the website without their knowledge or consent by exploiting the lack of CSRF protection.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious website or email can contain a crafted request that targets a vulnerable function in the JobScout theme, and when a logged-in user visits the malicious site or opens the email, the browser will automatically send the request to the target website on behalf of the user.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious website or opening a malicious email. The user must have sufficient privileges to perform the action the attacker is trying to force. The attacker does not need any prior authentication to the WordPress site."
