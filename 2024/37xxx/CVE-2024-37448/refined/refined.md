{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The WordPress OnePress theme lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious request and tricks a logged-in user into submitting it, leading to unauthorized actions.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into interacting with a malicious link or website they control. The attacker does not need to have any prior authentication to the WordPress site."
