{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Synapse server, by design, allows unauthenticated remote users to trigger the download and caching of remote media to the local media repository.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unauthenticated access to media download and caching endpoints."
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can plant problematic content in the media repository, making it available for download unauthenticated.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote network access by sending requests to the vulnerable endpoints."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "No authentication or user interaction is required. An attacker needs to send a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint."

     "mitigation": "Synapse 1.106 introduces new endpoints requiring authentication for media downloads as a partial mitigation. Unauthenticated endpoints will be frozen in future releases.",
     "workarounds": "Server operators can implement stricter IP-based rate limiting to mitigate the issue to some extent.",
