- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Mesmerize theme for WordPress lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions, under their current authentication. This is a general description, and the specific impact can vary depending on the actions that can be triggered.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website, leading to the execution of unauthorized actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs no authentication. The vulnerability exists in the Mesmerize theme version 1.6.120 and earlier. The attacker needs to craft a malicious request that will be triggered by a logged-in administrator.
