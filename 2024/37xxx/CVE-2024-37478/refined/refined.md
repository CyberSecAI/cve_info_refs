- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Ashe Theme (<= 2.233) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The theme lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. Specific impacts vary.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, performs unintended actions on their behalf.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to convince an authenticated user to trigger the malicious request, often through social engineering. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
