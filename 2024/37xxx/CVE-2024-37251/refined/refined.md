- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Advanced Custom Fields PRO plugin versions prior to 6.3.2 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability that could allow an attacker to force higher privileged users to perform unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact can vary depending on the actions that the attacker forces a user to perform.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor can exploit the CSRF vulnerability by tricking a logged-in user into unknowingly submitting a malicious request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious page. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
