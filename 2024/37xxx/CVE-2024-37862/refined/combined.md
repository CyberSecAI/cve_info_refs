| Bug report **Required Info:**   * Operating System:   + Ubuntu 22.04 * ROS2 Version:   + humble * Version or commit hash:   + the latest * DDS implementation:   + default  Steps to reproduce issue To adapt to scenarios where the robot within high-speed needs to decelerate in advance, we tried setting a larger `inflation_radius` for the `global_costmap` in the configuration and launch navigation2 under this setup.  Here is our launch command:  ``` source install/setup.bash source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH:/opt/ros/humble/share/turtlebot3_gazebo/models ros2 launch nav2_bringup tb3_simulation_launch.py params_file:=my_nav2_params.yaml ```  there's only one difference between `my_nav2_params.yaml` and defaulted `nav2_params.yaml`, ( we specially set the inflation\_radius of global\_costmap as 2333), as following:  ``` #my_nav2_params.yaml ...... global_costmap:       ......       inflation_layer:         inflation_radius: 2333.3     ...... ``` Expected behavior We expected to see the robot's performance within a larger inflation\_radius, but we encountered a program crash instead. Actual behavior We found **WRITE-memory-access-error** during the costmap calculation process. Additional informationasan-report In order to identify the cause of the program crash, we attempted to use the Asanitizer to capture detailed information about the crash，as following:  ```

SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: SEGV (/home/.../ROS_ws/nav2/install/nav2_costmap_2d/lib/liblayers.so+0x184aca) (BuildId: 053d6c4190bf3c85c0b7d1884d980b5209d377f4) in nav2_costmap_2d::InflationLayer::computeCaches() ==87154==ABORTING  ``` our analysis focus on code lines : [inflation\_layer.cpp#L354-L361](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/blob/main/nav2_costmap_2d/plugins/inflation_layer.cpp#L354-L361)  We noticed that, `vector<>` is used here for computing caches. However, if the `inflation_radius` is larger than 2000, the size of vector (is equal to `cache_length_ * cache_length_` ) would be larger than 10^9, which could lead to issues with memory allocation for the vector.  In addition, we have a try to change these code lines as following, to empirically confirm our correct identification of the error in the code.  ```   // based on the inflation radius... compute distance and cost caches   if (cell_inflation_radius_ != cached_cell_inflation_radius_) {     cached_costs_.resize(cache_length_ * cache_length_);     cached_distances_.resize(cache_length_ * cache_length_);          // code for debug    std::cout << "before write" << std::endl;    cached_distances_[ (cache_length_ -1) * cache_length_ - 1 ] = 1.0;    std::cout << "after write" << std::endl;    //  end       for (unsigned int i = 0; i < cache_length_; ++i) {       for (unsigned int j = 0; j < cache_length_; ++j) {         cached_distances_[i * cache_length_ + j] = hypot(i, j);       }     } ```  as a result, we catched the output as following:  ``` before write Segmentation fault (core dumped) ```  It seems that using the `vector<>.resize()` function here may not handle the corresponding memory allocation correctly. suggestion: If the navigation2-stack is willing to support calculations with such large data, could we consider changing the `vector` to use a `Linked List Array` to prevent such memory errors? |

| 2km is an outrageous size for an inflation radius - you don't have a 2km wide costmap, do you?  I don't consider that to be a legit solution to the problem you're seeking to address and I wouldn't support messing with lower-level data structures that have been proven in production for 10+ years to support that 😉  Moreover, inflation radius is a double, not an int, so I'm not sure that your snippet actually works with ROS 2 static parameter type declarations.  It seems that using the vector<>.resize() function here may not handle the corresponding memory allocation correctly.  That seems to point that your problem. If my back of the envelope calculations are right, (2333\*20)^2 is the size of the cache then. If we have doubles, thats `*8` bytes. That is over 8.7GB on RAM. That's a ridiculous request unless you're on a high performance computing platform with 20+ GB of RAM. This doesn't seem to point to any issue with Nav2, but what you're doing is probably a little misguided :-) |

| Moreover, inflation radius is a double, not an int, so I'm not sure that your snippet actually works with ROS 2 static parameter type declarations.  Sorry, I made a typo here. The input we used was 2333.3, and I have corrected it in the original text  2km is an outrageous size for an inflation radius - you don't have a 2km wide costmap, do you?  I am curious about how navigation2-stack performs on micro robots, and I consider the unit of numbers to be `mm` during use, which is why I use large values like 2k (which means it represents 2m instead of 2km).  That's a ridiculous request unless you're on a high performance computing platform with 20+ GB of RAM.  It makes sense! It's not very possible to deploy 20+ GB of RAM on a micro robot, so this is indeed caused by my incorrect use.  Thanks for your patience : ) |

| Thanks for the report - in general its not planned for us to protect users from themselves with every parameter if they choose something impossible. We try where we can, but the codebase would balloon to 2x the size for checking every single parameter for every way that it could be misinterpreted.  I don't disagree with you that you could make the system crash on initialization if you set the width/height to a negative value. I put that in the category of "fair" since its not a crash mid-execution, non-deterministically, or during operations. That is a crash you would see immediately when you tried to bring the system up, every time, that could be debugged before proceeding. I take crashes very seriously, but for parameter misconfiguration of this nature, its not realistic today that we're going to protect users from making errors on every one of a thousand parameters.  However, that's not an unreasonable ask, so I'm going to rename the ticket in line with that and it'll stay in the tracker so that perhaps in the future when we're better resourced we can potentially have some interns do this, but no promises / commitments. |

| [@GoesM](https://github.com/GoesM) perhaps your extra memory problems are related to your misconfigurations 😉  Ask on Robotics stack exchange with your config file changes and I'll follow up there on that topic. I don't want tickets to become > 1 topic, so I don't want to pollute this thread with that discussion. I hope that makes sense |

| It is already possible with parameter descriptions. It is more a matter of time / inclination to set bounds on all N params in the stack (and make sure the dynamic parameter callbacks are respecting them too). The blockage isn’t the tech, it’s the value proposition of time.  You should see the amount of code is required per-parameter in this case. Certainly some can be abstracted into Utils, but still. |
