{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "CVE": "CVE-2024-37862",
      "root_cause": "A large value for the `inflation-radius` parameter in the `globalcostmap` can cause a WRITE-memory-access error due to excessive memory allocation when computing caches within the `InflationLayer`.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient bounds checking on user-provided parameters, specifically the `inflation_radius`.",
        "Unbounded memory allocation for caches based on the inflation radius leading to a large memory footprint and potential crash."
      ],
      "impact": "The program crashes due to a segmentation fault caused by a WRITE-memory-access error during costmap calculation.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by providing a large value for the `inflation_radius` parameter in the costmap configuration.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to modify the ROS2 navigation configuration files or parameters to set an extremely large inflation radius."
    },
        {
      "CVE": "CVE-2024-37862",
      "root_cause": "User misconfiguration of the `height` parameter in the local costmap to a negative value can cause the system to crash during initialization.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Lack of input sanitization on costmap parameters.",
          "Unbounded memory allocation based on user-supplied negative height value, leading to system instability and crashes."
      ],
      "impact": "The program crashes during initialization, leading to a denial of service. Additionally, it can result in high memory usage and system instability.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attacker needs to modify the ROS2 navigation configuration files to set a negative height value for the local costmap.",
           "required_capabilities":"The attacker needs the ability to modify the ROS2 navigation configuration files or parameters."
