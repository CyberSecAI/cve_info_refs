Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a broken access control issue. The API endpoint `/Role/GetGridItems` was not properly protected, allowing unauthorized access. Additionally, the `/RoleMenuMapping/AddRoleMenu` endpoint also lacked proper authorization checks, allowing modification of user roles by unauthorized users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The application fails to properly enforce authorization, allowing low-privilege users to access and modify resources they should not be able to. Specifically, the `/Role/GetGridItems` endpoint was accessible to low-privilege users, and the `/RoleMenuMapping/AddRoleMenu` endpoint lacked adequate authorization, permitting modification of roles.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Full Vertical Privilege Escalation:** A low-privilege authenticated user can escalate their privileges to become a super administrator. This grants them full access to all features and functionalities of the portal.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Request Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates HTTP requests using a proxy (Burp Suite) to access unauthorized API endpoints.
*  **API endpoint abuse:** By accessing the `/Role/GetGridItems` API, the attacker can obtain Role IDs. They then use these IDs, in conjunction with the `/RoleMenuMapping/AddRoleMenu` API, to grant themselves full permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low-Privilege User Account:** The attacker needs to have a valid, but low-privilege, user account on the application.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify network requests using a proxy tool like Burp Suite.
*   **Knowledge of API endpoints:** The attacker needs to discover the vulnerable API endpoints.
