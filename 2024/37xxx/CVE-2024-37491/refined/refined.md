- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Rife Free theme for WordPress versions 2.4.18 and earlier is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The theme lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to induce unintended actions by authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact will vary depending on the context of the vulnerable action.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by tricking an authenticated user into clicking on a crafted link or visiting a website that triggers a forged request on the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and trick an authenticated user into triggering it.
