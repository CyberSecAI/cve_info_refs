- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Coachify theme for WordPress versions 1.0.7 and below is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The theme lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions while authenticated. Specific impacts would vary case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor could trick an authenticated user into clicking a crafted link or visiting a malicious website, leading to unwanted actions performed on the vulnerable website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and lure a logged-in user into triggering it. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
