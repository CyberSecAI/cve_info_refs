- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Construction Landing Page Theme <= 1.3.5 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The theme lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions on the WordPress site while authenticated.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is carried out through crafted requests initiated from an attacker-controlled website or other means and delivered to a user who is authenticated to the target website running the vulnerable theme.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website that makes the forged request to the vulnerable website. No prior access is required.
