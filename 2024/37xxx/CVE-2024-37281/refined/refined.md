- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A user with the Viewer role can cause a Kibana instance to crash by sending a large number of maliciously crafted requests to a specific endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Denial of Service vulnerability due to lack of input validation or resource management when handling a high volume of crafted requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack results in a crash of the Kibana instance, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack by sending a large number of crafted requests to a specific endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a Viewer role in Kibana.
