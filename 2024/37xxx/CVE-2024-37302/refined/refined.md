- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient rate limiting on remote media downloads, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to induce the server to download and cache large amounts of media.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inadequate rate limit strategy for remote media downloads, leading to potential disk exhaustion.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service due to disk space exhaustion, potentially leading to failure of further media uploads/downloads or complete unavailability of the Synapse process.
- **Attack vectors:** Network. An unauthenticated attacker can send requests to the server, triggering media downloads.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the Synapse server and does not require any privileges or user interaction.
