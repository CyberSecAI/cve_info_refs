- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect execution-assigned permissions in the IntelÂ® Advanced Link Analyzer Standard Edition software installer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**:  The installer sets incorrect permissions which allows for privilege escalation
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user can potentially escalate their privileges via local access.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access by an authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated user with local access to the system. The user also needs to have some level of interaction with the installer (User Interaction is a requirement according to CVSS vector).
