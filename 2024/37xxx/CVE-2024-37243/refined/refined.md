- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Vandana Lite theme for WordPress versions 1.1.9 and below is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The theme lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to potentially force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could lead to unauthorized actions being performed on a WordPress site if an authenticated user is tricked into triggering the malicious request.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into submitting it. This usually involves social engineering, such as embedding the request in a link or an image on a website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and must have some method to convince a logged-in user to trigger that request. This could be through a phishing attack, by posting a link on a forum, or by embedding the exploit on a website. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
