- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the affected software allowing users to save projects within a public directory due to improper input validation. This is tied to the default folder privileges, which grant excessive access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Improper Input Validation (CWE-20): The software does not properly validate the save path, allowing users to save projects in public directories.
    - Inadequate access controls: The default folder privileges allow excessive access, enabling modification or deletion of files by users with local access.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Local attackers can modify or delete project files.
    - A malicious user can escalate privileges by changing the macro to execute arbitrary code.
    - Remote Code Execution through modified project files or macros.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Local access is required.
    - The attack involves saving a project to a public directory, which can be a malicious or modified project.
    - It requires user interaction (UI:R/P) in the sense that the user is likely tricked into opening the malicious project.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker requires local access to the system.
    - The attacker needs to have the ability to save project files, and potentially to modify macros.
