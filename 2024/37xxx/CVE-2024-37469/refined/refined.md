- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability allows attackers to force authenticated users to perform unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized actions being performed by higher privileged users. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves tricking an authenticated user into making a request to the vulnerable site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated user into performing a request. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated.
