- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks sufficient protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), which allows an attacker to trick an authenticated user into performing unintended actions on the website.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a malicious actor to force a higher-privileged user to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact may vary on a case-by-case basis.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a malicious actor crafting a request that, when unknowingly triggered by an authenticated user, performs unauthorized actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated themselves but needs a way to trick an authenticated user into submitting the malicious request, usually by making them click a link or visit a malicious website.
