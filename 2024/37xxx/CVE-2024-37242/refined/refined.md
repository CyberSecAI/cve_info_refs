- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Newspack Newsletters WordPress plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. This could lead to unauthorized modifications or data manipulation within the plugin's settings or functionalities.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, would execute the desired unwanted action. The user would need to be logged into the vulnerable WordPress instance.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and trick an authenticated user into triggering it. The attacker does not need to be authenticated but needs to target a logged-in user.
