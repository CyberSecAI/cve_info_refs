Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-8960:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when handling SVG file uploads within the Cowidgets â€“ Elementor Addons plugin for WordPress.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize SVG files, allowing malicious scripts embedded within these files to be stored and subsequently executed when accessed by other users.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not adequately validate or sanitize the content of uploaded SVG files, permitting the injection of arbitrary code.
*   **Insufficient Output Escaping:** When displaying the uploaded SVG files or their content, the plugin does not properly escape the output. This allows the injected scripts to be executed by the browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of users' browsers who access a page displaying the malicious SVG file.
*   **Account Hijacking:** If an administrator accesses a page with the malicious SVG, the attacker could potentially gain admin access.
*   **Malicious Actions:** Attackers could perform a wide range of malicious actions, such as redirecting users to malicious websites, stealing session cookies, defacing websites, or performing other unauthorized actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **SVG File Upload:** The primary attack vector is through the upload of malicious SVG files via the WordPress media library using the affected plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an account with Author-level privileges or higher on the WordPress site.
*   **Ability to Upload Files:** The attacker needs to be able to upload SVG files to the media library.
