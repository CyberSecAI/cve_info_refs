{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the parsing of JB2 files, which can lead to an out-of-bounds read.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds read",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Information disclosure. An attacker can potentially use this vulnerability in combination with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a malicious PDF file containing a crafted JB2 file. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability, as the target needs to open a malicious file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a malicious PDF with a specially crafted JB2 file. The attacker does not need any special privileges. The attacker has to rely on social engineering or other means to trick the victim into opening the crafted PDF file."
