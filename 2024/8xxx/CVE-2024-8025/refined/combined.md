Be sure to read the following notes:

1. #### The NEF Codec

   The effects of the NEF Codec are not reflected when NEF images are displayed in Microsoft Photos.

   Windows Photo Gallery, Windows Live Photo Gallery, Windows Photo Viewer, and other applications that use the Nikon NEF Codec to display pictures will show the previews embedded in the NEF (RAW) files.
2. #### “Camera Model” and “Camera Manufacturer”

   Do not change the “Camera model” and “Camera Manufacturer” fields in the “Details” tab of the NEF file properties. Operation of Nikon applications and the NEF Codec is not guaranteed if these fields are changed.
3. #### Rotating NEF Images

   NEF images cannot be rotated in the Explorer, Windows Photo Gallery, Windows Photo Viewer, or Windows Live Photo Gallery.
4. #### NEF (RAW) Thumbnails

   Thumbnails for NEF (RAW) files may not display correctly in the Explorer, Windows Photo Gallery or Windows Photo Viewer. If this occurs, use Disk Cleanup as described below.

   | * 1) Right-click the system disk in **Computer** and select **Properties**. * 2) Select **Disk Cleanup** in the **General** tab. * 3) Under **Files to delete** in **Disk Cleanup**, check **Thumbnails** and uncheck all other options. * 4) Select **OK** to start disk cleanup; when a confirmation message “Are you sure you want to permanently delete these files?” is displayed, select **Delete Files**. |
   | --- |
5. #### Capture NX 2 Version 2.3.0 or Later

   If NEF images saved in Capture NX 2 version 2.3.0 or later are opened in Windows Photo Gallery, Windows Live Photo Gallery, or Windows Photo Viewer:

# Advisory Details

October 24th, 2024
## Nikon NEF Codec Thumbnail Provider NRW File Parsing Heap-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-24-1422ZDI-CAN-19873

| CVE ID | [CVE-2024-8025](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8025) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.0, [AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Nikon](https://www.nikon.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [NEF Codec](https://downloadcenter.nikonimglib.com/en/download/sw/203.html) |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Nikon NEF Codec. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of NRW files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Nikon has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2024-06-27 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2024-10-24 - Coordinated public release of advisory * 2024-10-24 - Advisory Updated |
