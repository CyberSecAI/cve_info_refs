### Summary:
The provided content describes a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the PeproDev WooCommerce Receipt Uploader plugin for WordPress.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the plugin's use of `add_query_arg` without proper sanitization when constructing URLs. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Improper neutralization of input during web page generation

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. If a user is tricked into clicking on a malicious link, the injected script will execute in their browser, potentially leading to:
- Session hijacking
- Data theft
- Defacement of website
- Redirection to malicious websites

**Attack vectors:**
-  An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript code in a parameter.
-  The attacker tricks a user into clicking on the crafted link.
-  The vulnerable plugin uses the unsanitized parameter in the URL via `add_query_arg`, causing the malicious script to execute in the user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- They must be able to create and disseminate the malicious URL, and trick a user into visiting the link.
