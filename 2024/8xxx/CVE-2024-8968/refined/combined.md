## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# MaxButtons < 9.8.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS via Text Color

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

- Add/Edit a Button
- On the "Text Color" field paste the following payload: `"160" onmouseover=alert(1)//"`
- On the preview modal on the side of the screen hover over the button and verify the alert was displayed.

### Affects Plugins
