- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient validation of the authenticity of the firmware image during the firmware update process of the Visteon Infotainment VIP microcontroller.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The system does not properly verify the authenticity of the supplied firmware image before programming it into the internal memory, allowing for the injection of malicious firmware.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local privilege escalation, arbitrary code execution in the context of the VIP MCU. An attacker can gain high levels of control over the infotainment system.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system. Then, they can supply a malicious firmware image to the update process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have local access and the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
