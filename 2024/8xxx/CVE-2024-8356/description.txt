Visteon Infotainment VIP MCU Code Insufficient Validation of Data Authenticity Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Visteon Infotainment systems. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the firmware update process of the VIP microcontroller. The process does not properly verify authenticity of the supplied firmware image before programming it into internal memory. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges execute arbitrary code in the context of the VIP MCU. Was ZDI-CAN-23758.
