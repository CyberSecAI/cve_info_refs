## WinZip Mark-of-the-Web Bypass Vulnerability

### ZDI-24-1234ZDI-CAN-23983

| CVE ID | [CVE-2024-8811](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8811) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | WinZip Computing |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | WinZip |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web protection mechanism on affected installations of WinZip. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of archive files. When opening an archive that bears the Mark-of-the-Web, WinZip removes the Mark-of-the-Web from the archive file. Following extraction, the extracted files also lack the Mark-of-the-Web. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Fixed in WinZip 76.8 |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2024-05-03 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2024-09-17 - Coordinated public release of advisory * 2024-09-17 - Advisory Updated |
