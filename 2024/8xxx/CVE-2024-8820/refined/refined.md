{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of U3D files, which can lead to a read past the end of an allocated buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Out-of-bounds read"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose sensitive information. It could also be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a malicious file or visits a malicious page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious U3D file that, when parsed by the application, causes an out-of-bounds read. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability."
