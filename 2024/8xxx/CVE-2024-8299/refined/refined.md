Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-8299:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427):** The vulnerability stems from the way the AlarmWorX64 MMX Phone agent searches for and loads DLL files. Specifically, it does not sufficiently control the paths it uses, leading to the possibility of loading malicious DLLs from locations an attacker controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **DLL Hijacking:** The uncontrolled search path allows for a DLL hijacking attack where a specially crafted DLL is placed in a location that the vulnerable application searches, leading to the malicious code execution when the application loads the tampered DLL instead of the legitimate one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker could potentially disclose sensitive information from the affected products.
*   **Data Tampering/Destruction:** Malicious code execution could lead to data modification, destruction, or deletion within the affected products.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can result in a denial-of-service condition, disrupting the functionality of the products.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the system where the vulnerable software (GENESIS64 or MC Works64) is installed.
*   **File Placement/Tampering:** The attacker needs to place or tamper with a malicious DLL file in a specific location that will be searched by the application when loading the component containing the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local System Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to write files to the local file system, particularly in locations that the vulnerable application will search.
*   **Privileges:** The attacker would need sufficient privileges to place/modify DLLs. This could be a low-privileged user but it needs to be a valid user on the system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the AlarmWorX64 MMX Phone agent of both GENESIS64 and MC Works64.
*   For versions of the software prior to 10.97.3, this vulnerability is always present.
*   For 10.97.3 and later, the vulnerability is present only if the multi-agent notification feature is installed.
*   There is no plan to release a fixed version.
*   Mitigation for this vulnerability involves uninstalling the multi-agent notification feature if not needed, and otherwise ensuring a secured environment
*  CISA has assigned a CVSS v4 base score of 8.5 for this vulnerability.
