{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of U3D files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds read vulnerability due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data within U3D file parsing.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can disclose sensitive information by triggering a read past the end of an allocated buffer. The vulnerability can be combined with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted malicious U3D file or visiting a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious U3D file or a malicious webpage that triggers the vulnerable code. The user must interact with the malicious content to trigger the vulnerability. No special privileges are required on the local system."
