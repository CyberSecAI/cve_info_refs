  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing EMF files, which can lead to a read past the end of an allocated object.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds read due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data in EMF file parsing.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Information disclosure. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by opening a malicious EMF file or visiting a malicious page containing such content.",
