Vulnerability Details

CVE ID: CVE-2024-8933

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 7.5 | High | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
CVSS v4.0 Base Score 7.5 | High | CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:P/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N

CWE-924: Improper Enforcement of Message Integrity During Transmission in a Communication Channel
vulnerability exists that could cause retrieval of password hash that could lead to denial of service and loss of
confidentiality and integrity of controllers. To be successful, the attacker needs to inject themself inside the
logical network while a valid user uploads or downloads a project file into the controller.

CVE ID: CVE-2024-8935

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 7.5 | High | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
CVSS v4.0 Base Score 7.7 | High | CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:P/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N

CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing vulnerability exists that could cause a denial of service and loss
of confidentiality and integrity of controllers when conducting a Man-In-The-Middle attack between the
controller and the engineering workstation while a valid user is establishing a communication session. This
vulnerability is inherent to Diffie Hellman algorithm which does not protect against Man-In-The-Middle attacks.

The severity of vulnerabilities was calculated using the CVSS Base metrics for 4.0 (CVSS v4.0). CVSS v3.1
will be still evaluated until the adoption of CVSS v4.0 by the industry. The severity was calculated without

incorporating the Temporal and Environmental metrics. Schneider Electric recommends that customers score
the CVSS Environmental metrics, which are specific to end-user organizations, and consider factors such as
the presence of mitigations in that environment. Environmental metrics may refine the relative severity posed
by the vulnerabilities described in this document within a customer’s environment.

Schneider Electric is establishing a remediation plan for all future versions
of Modicon M340 that will include a fix for CVE-2024-8933 vulnerability and
a mitigation for CVE-2024-8935.

We will update this document when the remediation is available. Until then,
customers should immediately apply the following mitigations to reduce the
risk of exploit:

•  Setup network segmentation and implement a firewall to block all

unauthorized access to port 502/TCP

•  Configure the Access Control List following the recommendations of
the user manuals: “Modicon M340 for Ethernet Communications
Modules and Processors User Manual” in chapter “Messaging
Configuration Parameters”:
https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/31007131K01000/

•  Consider use of external firewall devices such as EAGLE40-07 from
Belden to establish VPN connections. For more details refer to
“Modicon Controller Systems Cybersecurity, User Guide”:
https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/EIO0000001999/

•  Ensure the M340 CPU is running with the memory protection

activated by configuring the input bit to a physical input, for more
details refer to the following guideline “Modicon Controller Systems
Cybersecurity, User Guide” chapter “Controler Memory Protection”:
https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/EIO0000001999/

Schneider Electric is establishing a remediation plan for all future versions
of Modicon MC80 that will include a fix for CVE-2024-8933. We will update
this document when the remediation is available. Until then, customers
should immediately apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of
exploit:

•  Setup network segmentation and implement a firewall to block all

unauthorized access to port 502/TCP

•  Configure the Access Control List following the recommendations of
the user manuals: “MC80 Programmable Logic Controller(PLC),
User Manual” in the section “Access Control List (ACL)”:

General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.

•  Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from

•

the business network.
Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control and safety
systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.

•  Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the “Program” mode.
•  Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for that device.
•  Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB drives, etc.

before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.

•  Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the intended network to

connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.

•  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that they are not

accessible from the Internet.

•  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).
Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version
available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.
