- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is inherent to the Diffie-Hellman algorithm which does not protect against Man-In-The-Middle attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authentication Bypass by Spoofing (CWE-290)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service and loss of confidentiality and integrity of controllers.
- **Attack vectors:** Man-In-The-Middle attack between the controller and the engineering workstation while a valid user is establishing a communication session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the controller and the engineering workstation. The attacker must be present in the network during establishment of a valid user communication session.
