- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing buffer length check in `bt_avdtp_l2cap_recv` function within `zephyr/subsys/bluetooth/host/classic/avdtp.c`. The code pulls data from the `net_buf` without verifying if enough data remains after processing the header.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of input validation, specifically a missing length check before reading data from a network buffer. This leads to a potential out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation could result in instability (crash) or a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack, specifically via a crafted Bluetooth AVDTP (Audio/Video Distribution Transport Protocol) packet.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted Bluetooth AVDTP packets to the vulnerable device. No specific privileges or user interaction is required. The attacker would need to be within the Bluetooth radio range of the vulnerable device.
