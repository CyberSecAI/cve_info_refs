- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of PDF files, leading to a read past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Information disclosure. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability, possibly in conjunction with other vulnerabilities, to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker must provide a malicious PDF file that the user opens, or have the user visit a malicious page to trigger the vulnerability
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be remote, but requires user interaction (opening a malicious PDF file or visiting a malicious page).
