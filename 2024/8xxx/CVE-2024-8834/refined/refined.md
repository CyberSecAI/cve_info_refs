{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing TIF files, leading to a read past the end of an allocated object.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Out-of-bounds read",
    "Improper input validation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can disclose sensitive information. This vulnerability can also be leveraged with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious TIF file and making the victim open it or visit a malicious page containing it.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious TIF file or have the victim visit a malicious page containing a crafted TIF file. User interaction is required."
