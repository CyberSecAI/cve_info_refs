{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Uncontrolled long string inputs to `ldap_escape` on 32-bit systems can cause an integer overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer overflow leading to out-of-bounds write.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Out-of-bounds write.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending long strings as input to the `ldap_escape` function.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to control the input string to the `ldap_escape` function, and the target system needs to be 32-bit."
