- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of PDF files, leading to a read past the end of an allocated object.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Information disclosure. An attacker could potentially leverage this vulnerability in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors:** Opening a malicious PDF file or visiting a malicious page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to entice a user to open a malicious PDF file or visit a malicious page. User interaction is required.
