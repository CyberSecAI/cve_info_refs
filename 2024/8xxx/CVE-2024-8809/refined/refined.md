Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-8809:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied strings before they are used to execute a system call within the web service of Cohesive Networks VNS3.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw. The web service does not sanitize or validate user-provided input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands into a system call.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- Root Context: The code is executed in the context of the root user, granting the attacker full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The attack is performed remotely over the network.
- Web Service: The vulnerability resides in the web service component of VNS3, which listens on TCP port 8000 by default.
- User-Supplied Input: The attack uses a malicious user-supplied string to inject commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the affected VNS3 instance, specifically to TCP port 8000.
- Authentication: The advisory indicates that authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- Affected Product: Cohesive Networks VNS3.
- Patch Availability: Cohesive Networks has released updates to correct this vulnerability in releases 6.2.8+ and 6.6.7+, and has also provided live patches for existing controllers.
- CVSS Score: 8.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2024-07-25, and the coordinated public release of the advisory was on 2024-09-17.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Mehmet INCE (@mdisec) from PRODAFT.com.
- Cohesive Networks has acknowledged that four issues were discovered via Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative, with the corresponding CVE items: CVE-2024-8809, CVE-2024-8808, CVE-2024-8807, CVE-2024-8806.
- Cohesive Networks advises users to restrict port 8000 access to a known “allow list” of addresses, and they offer patching assistance.
- Two of the four issues could allow for unauthenticated remote code execution, and two could allow authenticated administrator remote code execution, all requiring port 8000 access.
- A successful attack requires control plane TCP port 8000 access to a VNS3 controller which could allow an unauthenticated user to inject and execute arbitrary code.
- Users of the Wireguard(tm) VPN feature in 6.0.0-6.0.20 should contact Cohesive for immediate patching or upgrade assistance.
