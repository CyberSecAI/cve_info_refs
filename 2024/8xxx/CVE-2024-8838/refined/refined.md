{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists within the parsing of XPS files due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, leading to a read past the end of an allocated buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds read.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file containing a crafted XPS file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious XPS file and have the target user open it or visit a malicious page that triggers the parsing of the malicious file. No special privileges are required."
