{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies within the `init_content_lostpassword_user_email_controls` function of the Essential Addons for Elementor plugin. This function, likely related to constructing or sending password reset emails, improperly handles sensitive user data.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive user information (usernames and passwords). The vulnerability stems from the plugin's handling of password reset email notifications. It appears that user credentials are included in the email's HTML content, making them accessible if the email is viewed with images enabled.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows attackers to obtain usernames and passwords for all users on the affected site, including administrators. This could lead to complete compromise of the WordPress website.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is network-based, targeting password reset email notifications. Attackers initiate a password change request, and when the targeted user opens the notification (with images enabled), their credentials become exposed.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires Author-level access or higher on the WordPress site. The attacker must be authenticated and capable of initiating a password change request for any user. The user then needs to load the password reset email with images enabled."
