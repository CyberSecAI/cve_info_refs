CVE ID: CVE-2024-8938

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 8.1 | High | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
CVSS v4.0 Base Score 9.2 | Critical] | CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N

CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer vulnerability exists that could
cause a potential arbitrary code execution after a successful Man-In-The-Middle attack followed by sending a
crafted Modbus function call to tamper with memory area involved in memory size computation.

The severity of vulnerabilities was calculated using the CVSS Base metrics for 4.0 (CVSS v4.0). CVSS v3.1 will be
still evaluated until the adoption of CVSS v4.0 by the industry. The severity was calculated without incorporating
the Temporal and Environmental metrics. Schneider Electric recommends that customers score the CVSS
Environmental metrics, which are specific to end-user organizations, and consider factors such as the presence of
mitigations in that environment. Environmental metrics may refine the relative severity posed by the vulnerabilities
described in this document within a customer’s environment.

General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.

•  Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the

•

business network.
Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control and safety
systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.

•  Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the “Program” mode.
•  Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for that device.
•  Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB drives, etc. before

use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.

•  Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the intended network to

connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.

•  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that they are not

accessible from the Internet.

•  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).
Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version
available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.

For more information refer to the Schneider Electric Recommended Cybersecurity Best Practices document.
