Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper access control when generating a new issue with the `merge_request_to_resolve_discussions_of` parameter. Specifically, when a user (including non-members) navigates to a URL with this parameter, the application exposes unresolved threads from the specified merge request. These threads, marked as internal notes, should be visible only to project members with at least Reporter access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access control checks when rendering the page associated with the  `merge_request_to_resolve_discussions_of` parameter, leading to unauthorized disclosure of information.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Internal notes within threads, which are intended to be private to project members, are exposed to unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Non-members can view internal discussions that were intended for project members only. This could include sensitive information, discussions, or code snippets that were not meant to be public.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** The leaked information could potentially be leveraged by malicious actors to gain further insights into the project or identify other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Manipulation:** The attack vector is through crafting a specific URL that includes the `merge_request_to_resolve_discussions_of` parameter and the ID of a merge request containing the vulnerable threads.
*   **Public Projects:** The vulnerability is primarily exploitable in public projects.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Project Membership Required:** The attacker does not need to be a member of the project to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Basic Knowledge of Gitlab Project Structure:** The attacker needs to know the project and group name along with the Merge request ID.
*   **Web Browser:** The attacker only needs a web browser to access the crafted URL.

**Summary of Exploit Scenario:**
1.  An authorized user creates a merge request and starts an unresolved thread marked as an internal note.
2.  A non-member user constructs a URL with the format `<https://gitlab.com/groupA/projectA/-/issues/new?merge_request_to_resolve_discussions_of=1>`, replacing group A, project A and 1 with the corresponding details.
3.  Upon visiting this crafted URL, the non-member user can view the internal notes in the unresolved thread, which should not be visible to non-members.
