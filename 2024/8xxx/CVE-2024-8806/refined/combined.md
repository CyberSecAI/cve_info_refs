**LINUX Operating System “CUPS” Print Service RCE Compromise [26 September 2024] – CVE-2024-47176, CVE-2024-47076, CVE-2024-47175, CVE-2024-47177**

**\*NO ACTION REQUIRED\***

VNS3 is **NOT VULNERABLE** to the remote code execution via the port 631 printer service exploit.

Researcher Simone Margaritelli discovered a series of remote code execution risks in the “openprinting” system on Linux, which is deployed via a series of libraries to provide print services to Linux machine.  Here are examples of the issues.

* CVE-2024-47176 | **cups-browsed** <= 2.0.1 binds on UDP INADDR\_ANY:631 trusting any packet from any source to trigger a `Get-Printer-Attributes` IPP request to an attacker controlled URL.
* CVE-2024-47076 | **libcupsfilters** <= 2.1b1 `cfGetPrinterAttributes5` does not validate or sanitize the IPP attributes returned from an IPP server, providing attacker controlled data to the rest of the CUPS system.
* CVE-2024-47175 | **libppd** <= 2.1b1 `ppdCreatePPDFromIPP2` does not validate or sanitize the IPP attributes when writing them to a temporary PPD file, allowing the injection of attacker controlled data in the resulting PPD.
* CVE-2024-47177 | **cups-filters** <= 2.0.1 `foomatic-rip` allows arbitrary command execution via the `FoomaticRIPCommandLine` PPD parameter.

Even though VNS3 versions are not affected by this exploit it is good to remember deployment best practice.

* The VNS3 control plane port, TCP 8000, should not ever be open to the Internet, only via cloud security groups to specifically allowed source addresses such as your admin VPN, data center operations, or Cohesive remote support.
* The remote access port 22 should only ever be open to Cohesive’s remote support IP, and ideally, only opened via cloud security groups while an active support investigation is ongoing.
* In addition VNS3 default firewall does NOT allow any access to the print services port 631, nor are there any print service daemons running on VNS3.

VNS3 Network Platform uses a hardened Ubuntu Linux operating system and are built using the Elastic Server SBOM system. The base virtual images used to construct VNS3 Network Platform from 5.2.11 (5.x LTS) release through 6.2.9 and 6.6.8 (latest) have been reviewed and confirmed that these services are not installed nor running.  Additionally the Elastic Server build logs have been reviewed to confirm that these services are not configured to run in the build process, and finally VNS3 instances have been reviewed as well to confirm no presence of the targeted services.

Detailed [information here](https://www.evilsocket.net/2024/09/26/Attacking-UNIX-systems-via-CUPS-Part-I/).

**POTENTIAL REMOTE CODE EXECUTION BY UNAUTHENTICATED USER**

**\*ACTION REQUIRED: Confirm control plane port 8000 access limitations\*****\*ACTION REQUIRED: Upgrade to new cloud image or request patching assistance\***

**POTENTIAL RCE by unauthenticated user**
Four issues discovered via Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative ZDI-CAN-24160, ZDI-CAN-24176, ZDI-CAN-24177, ZDI-CAN-24178.
Corresponding CVE items: CVE-2024-8809, CVE-2024-8808,CVE-2024-8807,CVE-2024-8806

Cohesive has been working with customers to provide upgrades and patching assistance.
Fixes for these issues are included in releases 6.2.8+ and 6.6.7+.

The exploits are enabled by improperly parsed input.  In two locations improperly parsed API input could allow for unauthenticated remote code execution, and in an additional two locations improperly parsed input could allow for authenticated administrator remote code execution. All require port 8000 access to be open to exploit the vulnerabilities.

A successful attack requires control plane TCP port 8000 access to a VNS3 controller which could allow an unauthenticated user to inject and execute arbitrary code. Users of the Wireguard(tm) VPN feature in 6.0.0-6.0.20 should contact Cohesive for immediate patching or upgrade assistance. No other versions of VNS3 require port 8000 to have broad access.

Affected Products and Version:
VNS3 4.6.1+ (EOL – Upgrade)
VNS3 5.0.x (EOL – Upgrade)
VNS3 5.1.x (EOL – Upgrade)
VNS3 5.2.0-5.2.11 (EOL – Upgrade)
VNS3 5.2.12 LTS (Upgrade or request patching support)
VNS3 6.0.0-6.0.20 (EOL – Upgrade)
VNS3 6.1.1-6.1.4 (EOL – Upgrade)
VNS3 6.1.5-6.1.9 (Upgrade or request patching support)
VNS3 6.2.0-6.2.7 (Upgrade or request patching support)
VNS3 6.6.0-6.6.5 (Upgrade or request patching support)

Mitigating Actions: Restrict port 8000 access to only your known “allow list” addresses. (Please include Cohesive Remote Support IP 54.236.197.84 if requesting patching assistance.)

Solution: Live patches are available from Cohesive Networks (successful patch validated by VNS3 version number appended with “-p1”) for any existing controller. Alternatively upgrading VNS3 to the following versions will eliminate exposure:

* VNS3 6.2.8 or later
* VNS3 6.6.7 or later

**OpenSSH server side vulnerability “regreSSHion” RCE Compromise [1 July 2024] – CVE-2024-6387**

**\*NO ACTION REQUIRED\***

VNS3 is NOT VULNERABLE to the remote code execution via the OpenSSH server in this exploit.

Qualsys labs reported this vulnerability agains versions 8.5p1 and 9.7p1 of the OpenSSH server. VNS3 runs a security patched version 8.2p1 patch level 11, which is NOT vulnerable.

The compromise which could allow remote code execution on an affected host requires continuous, 4+ hour access to the TCP port (22 by default) on the affected host.

Even though VNS3 versions are not affected by this exploit it is good to remember deployment best practice.

* The VNS3 control plane port, TCP 8000, should not ever be open to the Internet, only via cloud security groups to specifically allowed source addresses such as your admin VPN, data center operations, or Cohesive remote support.
* The remote access port 22 should only ever be open to Cohesive’s remote support IP, and ideally, only opened via cloud security groups while an active support investigation is ongoing.
* In addition VNS3 default firewall does NOT allow any access to the OpenSSH port by default, rather admins must have enabled remote support via Web UI or API.

VNS3 Network Platform uses a hardened Ubuntu Linux operating system and are built using the Elastic Server SBOM system. The base virtual images used to construct VNS3 Network Platform from 5.2.11 (5.x LTS) release through 6.2.6 and 6.6.3 (latest) have been reviewed and confirmed that the OpenSSH server version is 8.2p1/patch11 and thus not affected. Additionally the Elastic Server build logs have been reviewed to confirm that no upgrade to a compromised version occurs in the build process, and finally VNS3 instances have been reviewed as well to confirm no presence of the compromised OpenSSH versions.

**XZ Supply Chain Compromise [29 March 2024] – CVE-2024-3094**

NOTE: VNS3 is NOT VULNERABLE to the supply chain compromise of the Linux XZ utility.
This severe compromise could allow remote code execution via a reverse shell capability built into the Linux “xz” utility and “liblzma” 5.6.0 or 5.6.1.

VNS3 Network Platform uses a hardened Ubuntu Linux operating system and are built using the Elastic Server SBOM system.
The base virtual images used to construct VNS3 Network Platform from 5.2.11 (5.x LTS) release through 6.2.2 (latest) have been reviewed and confirmed that the XZ and liblzma versions are 5.2.4, and thus not affected.  Additionally the Elastic Server build logs have been reviewed to confirm that no upgrade of XZ occurs in the build process, and finally VNS3 instances have been reviewed as well to confirm no presence of the compromised XZ versions.

CVE-2024-3094 – https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3094

\*NO ACTION REQUIRED\*

**OpenSSL Security Advisory “Elliptical Curve Infinite Loop” [15 March 2022] – CVE-2022-0778**

An exploit of the widely used OpenSSL library has been announced that in some situations can allow a denial-of-service attack. Remote code execution is NOT possible via this exploit.

LIMITED IMPACT ON VNS3 – NO IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED FOR MOST USE CASES

CVE-2022-0778 – <https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-0778>
OpenSSL Security Advisory Page – <https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20220315.txt>

REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION:

AT RISK: VNS3 deployments used today, that were INITIALLY deployed PRIOR to November, 2013.
If no new initialization of encrypted keyset has occurred since Nov 2013, then servers that have UDP 1194 open to the Internet are at risk. If the only VPN clients are “in-cloud” ensure port 1194 only open to cloud vpc/vnet to reduce exposure. Upgrade to VNS3 5.2.4 or contact Cohesive Support (support@www.cohesive.net) for a patch.

AT LIMITED RISK: VNS3 deployments using VNS3 version 3.0.4 (Nov 2013) or later for a “PeopleVPN” or road warrior use-case. A malicious user with a valid encrypted network credential (a “clientpack”) to the VPN could attempt to trigger a denial-of-service. Upgrade to VNS3 5.2.4 or contact Cohesive Support (support@www.cohesive.net) for a patch.

AT LIMITED RISK: VNS3 deployments using VNS3 version 3.0.4 (Nov 2013) or later for a machine-to-machine encrypted network. A malicious system administrator with root access to one of your servers could gain access to a valid encrypted network credential (a “clientpack”) and attempt to trigger a denial-of-service. While a system administrator with root access to your servers could do many things to interrupt service – this is a possibility for consideration. Upgrade to VNS3 5.2.4 or contact Cohesive Support (support@www.cohesive.net) for a patch.

AT NO RISK: VNS3 deployments using VNS3 3.0.4 (Nov 2013) or later that have NOT deployed any of the encrypted network credentials. As best practice, when not using the encrypted overlay do not have port 1194 open in cloud security groups/network acls. In addition, when not using the encrypted overlay, select the “Disable All” option on the “Clientpacks” page in the Web UI.

Cohesive has released updated cloud images as version 5.2.4 with latest security patches, including the patched version of OpenSSL.

**Libreswan Security Advisory [12 Jan 2022] – CVE-2022-23094**

The Libreswan project has published information about a recently patched vulnerability that can allow a denial of service attack (CVE-2022-23094). No remote code execution is possible via this attack, the vulnerability could allow an external third party to crash the VNS3 IPsec subsystem by sending repeated malformed IKEv1 packets on UDP 500.

NO IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED FOR MOST USE CASES – IF you have your cloud security group for the IPsec ports only open to your customer device(s) as recommended – then this specific exploit would not be of risk.

CVE-2022-23094 – <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-23094>
Libreswan CVE-2022-23094 Page – <https://libreswan.org/security/CVE-2022-23094/CVE-2022-23094.txt>

Vulnerable VNS3 versions: 4.11.4 – 5.2.2

REMEDIATION and PREVENTION:
Limiting UDP 500 and UDP 4500/ESP protocol 50 inbound access to the VNS3 controller instance from only those remote addresses needed for the IPsec VPN connections eliminates exposure to this vulnerability. Use the VNS3 firewall, cloud hypervisor firewall (e.g. Security Group) and/or cloud ACL to prevent exposure.

While the potential denial of service does represent a vulnerability, the attack vectors for VNS3 deployments are limited if at all present. Vulnerabilities of any kind can be controlled by implementing a layered/defense in depth security approach as defined below.

* When possible use cloud VLANs like those available in AWS VPC, Azure, Google Compute, and others.
* Use network ACLs and Hypervisor Port Filtering (like AWS Security Groups)
* Ideally a VNS3 Manager should only have the following port assignments:
  + TCP Port 8000 open to only your operations center and as needed to Cohesive Networks’ support address
  + TCP 22 only open as needed to Cohesive Networks’ support address
  + UDP 500 only open to specific partner IPsec endpoints for IKE/Phase1 connectivity
  + ESP/Protocol 50 only open to a specific partners IPsec endpoint address when using native IPsec
  + UDP 4500 only open to specific partner’s IPsec endpoint address when using encapsulated (NAT-T) IPsec
  + UDP 1195-1202 only open as documented to other VNS3 managers in a topology.
  + UDP 1194 only open to VNS3 clients IP addresses or subnet masks as required.
  + UDP SNMP port only open to your operational system making SNMP polling requests.
* To further secure your topologies we recommend using the VNS3 Network Firewall as well as host filtering on your cloud servers.

A new version of VNS3 has been released (Cloud Marketplace publishing process underway) that includes both the Libreswan patch and an update to the internal VNS3 Firewall that only allows inbound UDP 500, UDP 4500, and Protocol 50/ESP packets from configured IPsec Peer IPs to eliminate the vulnerability.

**Log4Shell Vulnerability [10 Dec 2021] – CVE-2021-44228**

Log4Shell vulnerability does NOT affect Cohesive VNS3 Platform.  Apache Log4j is not included in the VNS3 Network Platform or the VNS3:ms Management System.

\*NO ACTION REQUIRED\*

Critical zero-day vulnerability in the Java logging library Apache Log4j is easy to exploit and enables attackers to gain full control of affected servers.

**Open Management Infrastructure Remote Code Execution Vulnerability [12 Sept 2021] – CVE-2021-38647**

Recent Azure “OMI” agent vulnerability does NOT affect Cohesive VNS3 Platform.

\*NO ACTION REQUIRED\*

A recently discovered exploit allows unauthenticated remote code execution on servers (including Azure virtual machines) using the Azure OMI agent. Cohesive builds the VNS3 platform on top of a hardened Ubuntu Linux base. In order to be allowed in the Azure Marketplace we are required to run the “Azure Waagent” but do not install any other Microsoft software.

Cohesive has reviewed build logs and images confirming the agent is not present in any of our Azure releases.

The OMI agent uses tcp ports: 5986/5985/1270
VNS3 Platform users can easily confirm these ports are not in use using the Network Sniffer functionality in VNS3.

Vulnerable VNS3 versions: NONE

**VNS3 Vulnerability [7 Aug 2020] – CVE-2020-15467**

The vulnerability allows an AUTHENTICATED administrator to gain access to the VNS3 host operating system.  This vulnerability was discovered by researchers at Fireeye/Mandiant.  It is applicable to all VNS3 4.x versions prior to 4.11.1.

\*NO IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED FOR MOST USE CASES\*

The authenticated user has complete control of the VNS3 device.  They can reboot it, halt it, use the firewall to coerce, change, inspect or even redistribute traffic – as VNS3 is a network device for those very purposes.   Some network device providers provide shell access to their devices – something Cohesive does not do – as we believe VNS3 being a sealed appliance ensures consistency and integrity of performance.  Through our plugin system and customer controlled plugins we allow many of the capabilities of host access – with reduced risk of an improper change to the VNS3 appliance.

CVE-2020-15467 – https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15467

Vulnerable VNS3 versions: 4.0 to 4.9.2

REMEDIATION and PREVENTION:

* Upgrade to VNS3 4.11.1 which has been fixed for this vulnerability (as well as attempts at similar exploits both in Cohesive code and underlying library code).
* Contact Cohesive to patch in-place VNS3 appliances via remote support operation.  Customers with 24×7 support contracts will be given priority.
* Use VNS3 Administrator sign-on controls in VNS3 4.9.2+.   One of the feature areas we have focused on in the last several releases is Administrator login and logging.  VNS3 appliances can now be pointed at an LDAP directory, Active Directory or Google Gsuite account for authentication of its Administrators, with that information also captured in internal logging as Administrators take actions.   This can certainly provide insight into the actions and behaviors of your VNS3 Administrators.

While this does represent a vulnerability, the attack vectors for VNS3 deployments are limited if at all present. Vulnerabilities of any kind can be controlled by implementing a layered/defense in depth security approach as defined below.

**Libreswan Security Advisory [11 May 2020] – CVE-2020-1763**

The Libreswan project has published information about a recently patched vulnerability that can allow a denial of service attack (CVE-2020-1763). No remote code execution is possible via this attack, the vulnerability could allow an external third party to crash the VNS3 IPsec subsystem by sending repeated malformed IKEv1 packets on UDP 500.

\*NO IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED FOR MOST USE CASES\*

CVE-2020-1763 – https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2020-1763

Vulnerable VNS3 versions: 4.4.0 to 4.9.1
Not Vulnerable: 4.3.11 and earlier & 4.9.2 and later

REMEDIATION and PREVENTION:
Limiting UDP 500 and UDP 4500/ESP protocol 50 inbound access to the VNS3 controller instance from only those remote addresses needed for the IPsec VPN connections eliminates exposure to this vulnerability. Use the VNS3 firewall, cloud hypervisor firewall (e.g. Security Group) and/or cloud ACL to prevent exposure.

While the potential denial of service does represent a vulnerability, the attack vectors for VNS3 deployments are limited if at all present. Vulnerabilities of any kind can be controlled by implementing a layered/defense in depth security approach as defined below.

* When possible use cloud VLANs like those available in AWS VPC, Azure, Google Compute, and others.
* Use network ACLs and Hypervisor Port Filtering (like AWS Security Groups)

**Sad SACK [June 20 2019]:**
**CVE-2019-11477 for a remote denial of service (system crash)**
**CVE-2019-11478 for a remote denial of service (resource exhaustion)**
**CVE-2019-11479 for a remote denial of service (resource exhaustion)**

Several flaws in the way that the Linux kernel’s TCP implementation processes Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) options and handles low Maximum Segment Size (MSS) values. A remote attacker could use these issues to perform denial of service attacks on a server.

\*NO IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED FOR MOST USE CASES\*

The vulnerability requires access to open TCP ports on a device. In a sealed appliance like VNS3, no user has access by design and no malware is included via our strict build controls and there is no path/mechanism for malware to be installed when deployed following best practices.

Some use-cases use VNS3 as a Proxy Server facing the Internet via a TCP port like 80 or 443. In that case if that access is via the open Internet then we recommend customers contacting Cohesive Networks for an update cloud image or for patches via remote support access.

**DNSMASQ Vulnerabilities [2 Oct 2017]**

There are six issues discovered with the dnsmasq package (CVE-2017-14491, CVE-2017-14492, CVE-2017-14493, CVE-2017-14494, CVE-2017-14495, and CVE-2017-14496). The potential dnsmasq vulnerabilities result from how the package incorrectly handles DNS requests, IPv6 router advertisements, and DHCPv6 requests. These issues could be used to remotely cause dnsmasq to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.

Vulnerable VNS3 versions: NONE

The package is included in VNS3 version 3.5.x images as a build dependency (Docker which is used for the Network Security Plugin System) but the process that is exploitable is not running or available so no vulnerability exists.

Cohesive Networks will release a new VNS3 version 3.5.3 with a build date of 20171012 where we explicitly remove the unused dnsmasq package.

**OpenSSL: Malformed X.509 IPAddressFamily could cause OOB read [28 Aug 2017]**

The potential OpenSSL vulnerability (CVE-2017-3735) could allow a one-byte buffer overread when an X.509 certificate has a malformed IPAddressFamily extension. OpenSSL reports the most likely result would be an erroneous display of the certificate in text format. The vulnerability is being listed as low severity and no OpenSSL release is being made.

OpenSSL Advisory – <https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20170828.txt>

Vulnerable VNS3 version: 3.5 LTS and 4.x

REMEDIATION and PREVENTION:

While the potential access exploit does represent a vulnerability, the attack vectors for VNS3 deployments requires a bad actor to have a clientpack credential. As a result there is no exposure when following clientpack best practices defined below:

* Clientpack credentials should only be distributed known and trusted devices.
* Any unused clientpack credentials should be disabled via UI or API to prevent unauthorized use.
* Clientpacks credentials should be regenerated when a device that was using that credentials is deprovisioned.

Because this threat can be prevented with proper clientpack lifecycle management, a fix will be incorporated into future VNS3 versions.

**Kernel Local Privilege Escalation “Dirty COW” [19 Oct 2016]**

**glibc gethostbyname buffer overflow “GHOST Vulnerability” [27 January 2015]**
Qualys Security Advisory CVE-2015-0235 – <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/01/27/9>

Qualys researchers have found a vulnerability in the Linux GNU C Library (glibc) that can allow access to a system in specific scenarios. Attack vectors are theoretically possible – standard VNS3 deployment best practices do not allow for such attacks.

Access to TCP port 8000 (API/GUI) should only be available to your cloud hosts, and/or your operation center. Access to TCP port 22 should never be available via your cloud environment’s hypervisor firewall rules other than when explicitly enabled for a remote support event. Additionally TCP port 22 is controlled by the VNS3 Remote Support multi-factor/multi-party authentication system that is disabled by default on all VNS3 instances.

Vulnerabilities of any kind can be controlled by implementing a layered/defense in depth security approach as defined below.

* When possible use cloud VLANs like those available in AWS VPC, Azure, Google Compute, and others.
* Use network ACLs and Hypervisor Port Filtering (like AWS Security Groups)
* Ideally a VNS3 Manager should only have the following port assignments:

+ TCP Port 8000 open to only your operations center and as needed to Cohesive Networks’ support address
+ TCP 22 only open as needed to Cohesive Networks’ support address
+ UDP 500 only open to specific partner IPsec endpoints for IKE/Phase1 connectivity
+ ESP/Protocol 50 only open to a specific partners IPsec endpoint address when using native IPsec

+ UDP 1194 only open to VNS3 clients IP addresses or subnet masks as required.
+ UDP SNMP port only open to your operational system making SNMP polling requests.

* To further secure your topologies we recommend using the VNS3 Network Firewall as well as host filtering on your cloud servers.

If you have any questions or would like Cohesive Networks Support to patch your running VNS3 instances, please contact us. The patch will require Cohesive Networks to access your VNS3 instance(s) via Remote Support, patch the glibc package, and reboot the VNS3 instance. As a result a short operational window will be required.

NOTE: A new point release of VNS3 3.5 is imminent and will include the patch. Images will be available to customers early the week of February 2nd.
**OpenVPN DoS Vulnerability [3 December 2014]**
The OpenVPN denial of service vulnerability ([CVE-2014-8104](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2014-8104)) does not warrant an emergency patch. The next release of VNS3 will include a fix. If you have any additional questions please don’t hesitate to contact us.
**POODLE SSL 3.0 Vulnerability [15 October 2014]**
Google researchers have found a flaw in SSL 3.0 (CVE-2014-3566) that allows the POODLE attack (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption).

SSL 3.0 Exploit Paper – https://www.openssl.org/~bodo/ssl-poodle.pdf

Register – http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/10/14/google\_drops\_ssl\_30\_poodle\_vulnerability/

All versions of the VNS3 (and older VPN3) UI does issue a session cookie but it is not associated with authentication. Thus in the event of a successful POODLE exploit, the attacker would not be able to get information to log into the VNS3 Manager’s UI.

Looking at the data that can be exploited there is no reason for patches or new VNS3 AMI builds. This is a client vulnerability, not a server vulnerability. Regardless in upcoming releases we will disable SSL 3.0 on the server side to ensure we deliver the highest quality product possible.

Our best practice recommendations are below:

* Make sure TCP port 8000 is restricted to only the IPs that are required to admin your VNS3 Manager(s) via the cloud hypervisor firewall rules (Security Groups, Cloud Service, etc.) and reinforced with similar restrictions via the VNS3 Firewall.
* Disable SSL 3.0 in your browsers being used to administer the VNS3 Managers. Here is information on how to disable on the most popular browsers:

**Shellshock Bug [24 September 2014]**
Bash Command Interface Vulnerability (CVE-2014-6271) VNS3 supported versions 2.7, 3.0, 3.01, 3.03, 3.04, and 3.5 are potentially affected by the Bash command interpreter bug being labeled the “shellshock” bug (CVE-2014-6271).

NIST Notification – <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-6271>

Coverage via The Register – <http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/09/24/bash_shell_vuln/>

While attacks on VNS3 instances are theoretically possible – the standard VNS3 deployment practices do not make such attacks likely. Access to TCP port 8000 should only be available to your cloud hosts, and/or your operation center. Access to TCP Port 22 should never be available other than when explicitly enabled for a remote support event. Additionally assuming access for potential attackers, they would still need a working credential to access either the VNS3 UI/API (UI doesn’t use cgi scripts) or ssh (one-time, unique key, controlled by you the customer). Regardless of this limited attack vector, we are still making new VNS3 images available for all supported cloud environments.

* For those of you operating in AWS, new AMIs have been built, deployed and shared with your accounts. Updated AMIs are listed below. Customer using and licensed for 2.x-3.0x use the following AMIs:

| Region | AMI ID |
| --- | --- |
| US-East-1 | ami-c66cd9ae |
| US-West-1 | ami-cbdcd48e |
| US-West-2 | ami-938ecda3 |
| EU-West-1, | ami-c4e948b3 |
| AP-Southeast-1 | ami-c06d4a92 |
| AP-Southeast-2 | ami-7bf49741 |
| AP-Northeast-1 | ami-251f3624 |
| SA-East-1 | ami-6b0aa076 |

* Customers using and licensed for 3.5x use the following AMIs (Note: only EBS-backed Images if you have previously received and agreed to the EBS Disclosure and Agreement):

| Region | AMI ID (Instance Store) | AMI ID (EBS) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| US-East-1 | ami-664df80e | ami-1c7bce74 |
| US-West-1 | ami-2fd2da6a | ami-a3ddd5e6 |

| SA-East-1 | ami-2308a23e | ami-f10aa0ec |

For other clouds where our images are listed in the public catalog, new images are delivered or being delivered to those catalogs.
If you operate in a cloud that does not have a Partner Image directory or Public catalog where an image has been built for you (e.g. Dimension Data, Azure, Google GCE ), we will contact you directly to deliver an updated VNS3 image.

**LZO Security Advisory [30 June 2014]**
Multiple Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-4607) Media outlets are reporting a 20 year old vulnerability to the LZO compression libraries used by the Linux Kernel and OpenVPN. Both [OpenVPN](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/ticket/419) and [LZO](http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/) home represent this as media hype as no current systems (including VNS3 deployments) are affected. The vulnerability requires decompression of 16MB of untrusted compressed bytes. VNS3 and OpenVPN use UDP which makes the exploitation impossible as UDP has a maximum packet size of 65,507 bytes.
**OpenSSL Security Advisory [05 June 2014]**
SSL/TLS MITM vulnerability (CVE-2014-0224) NOTE FOR AWS USERS: As a result of the following Security Advisory, new VNS3 version 3.04 AMIs have been built. Launch permissions have been transferred from the old 3.04 AMIs to the new 3.04 AMIs. If you have any questions feel free to contact our support team. Immediately after the DTLS discovery source code review showed another potential vulnerability where a man-in-the-middle exploit is possible. Review showed that this exploit has existed in all versions of OpenSSL. Most usage profiles of VNS3 or VPN3 do not lend themselves to this type of attack being practicable although it does have a theoretical possibility. Is there a way that the risk of these exploits, and in fact any code exploit can me minimized in my cloud deployments? Yes, following best practices for cloud deployment of VNS3 Managers and VNS3 clients will in most cases prevent these types of exploits from being practicable from outside your network. When deploying VNS3 we recommend using cloud computing’s built in capability for a “defense in depth” approach. VNS3 uses OpenSSL in multiple ways, with the primary use being within OpenVPN as part of in-band overlay networking, which is largely unaffected by any of these vulnerabilities. The other use is as part of the web UI and API services of VNS3 for HTTPS support, which is where the attacks can come into play if a layered security model isn’t being deployed.

* When possible use cloud VLANs like those available in AWS VPC, Azure, Google Compute, and others.
* Use network ACLs and Hypervisor Port Filtering (like AWS Security Groups)
* Ideally a VNS3 Manager should only have the following port assignments:

+ TCP Port 8000 open to only your operations center and as needed to Cohesive Networks’ support address
+ TCP 22 only open as needed to Cohesive Networks’ support address
+ UDP 500 only open to specific partner IPsec endpoints for IKE/Phase1 connectivity
+ ESP/Protocol 50 only open to a specific partners IPsec endpoint address when using native IPsec
+ UDP 4500 only open to specific partner’s IPsec endpoint address when using encapsulted (NAT-T) IPsec
+ UDP 1195-1202 only open as documented to other VNS3 managers in a topology.
+ UDP 1194 only open to VNS3 clients IP addresses or subnet masks as required.
+ UDP SNMP port only open to your operational system making SNMP polling requests.

* To further secure your topologies we recommend using the VNS3 Network Firewall as well as host filtering on your cloud servers.

**OpenSSL Security Advisory [05 Jun 2014]**
DTLS recursion flaw (CVE-2014-0221) VNS3 deployments are not impacted by the DTLS recursion flaw (CVE-2014-0221). The exploit involves using OpenSSL as a DTLS client. OpenVPN client does not do this.
**OpenSSL Security Advisory [07 Apr 2014]**
TLS heartbeat read overrun (CVE-2014-0160) VNS3 supported versions 2.7, 3.0, 3.01, 3.03, and 3.04 are NOT affected by the OpenSSL TLS heartbeat read overrun (CVE-2014-0160).

* OpenSSL Notification: [https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv\_20140407.txt](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140407.txt%C2%A0)
* TechCrunch Article: <http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/07/massive-security-bug-in-openssl-could-effect-a-huge-chunk-of-the-internet/>

VNS3 does take advantage of open source software for use as underlying components of the complete enterprise-grade cloud network appliance. Cohesive Networks extensively tests and vets all aspects of the VNS3 system before making a new version generally available. We are committed to your cloud success. If you have any additional questions please don’t hesitate to contact us.
