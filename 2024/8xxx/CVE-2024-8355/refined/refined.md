- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string (iAP Serial number) before using it to construct SQL queries within the DeviceManager of the Visteon Infotainment System.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected Visteon Infotainment system.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical presence and access to the device are required to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have physical access to the Visteon Infotainment system, but does not need any authentication credentials.
