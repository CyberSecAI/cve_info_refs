[@marcosgopen](https://github.com/marcosgopen) this is very much like copy-paste of LRATest. Refactor it so we don't need to always change the same thing in two different classes please.

As we discussed offline, I'm not sure what all the possible implications of removing synchronized from this method could be. I would like to hear from [@mmusgrov](https://github.com/mmusgrov) why it was synchronized in the first place.

[@marcosgopen](https://github.com/marcosgopen) I added a comment to the JBTM indicating that the tests are good but I'm not convinced that removing the monitor is the correct approach. Personally I would keep the tests but withdraw the fix and work on a different fix for the lock contention, do you mind if I look into the alternate approach?

I updated the PR, I am still removing the synchronized but adding the ReentrantLock during the enlistment. Could you have a look at this solution [@mmusgrov](https://github.com/mmusgrov) ?

The general technique used in the PR is a good one to break the lock contention. I did have some comments about other parts of the PR though so I have asked for changes.

Previous way of creating the LRA was not working anymore, lraID was not initialized and therefore was causing a NullPointerException at <https://github.com/jbosstm/narayana/blob/main/rts/lra/coordinator/src/main/java/io/narayana/lra/coordinator/domain/service/LRAService.java#L107>. So changing how it is initialized.

The NullPointerException path from tryLockTransaction(URI) that I observed was during the addition of tryLockTransaction needed for enlistParticipant so I expect changing this test is OK. Although the LongRunningAction(Uid) constructor is added for MBean listing, it is used here to initialize a useable LongRunningAction and so it is reasonable to change it to use one of the constructors that appear expected for that purpose.

The constructor should only be used when loading an LRA from the ObjectStore. So after constructing the LRA the expectation is that restore\_state will be called so that the URI for the LRA gets initialised. Clearly the code is brittle so it would be nice to firm it up in this area - I have raised [JBTM-3919](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/JBTM-3919) so that we don't loose site of it.

| [@mmusgrov](https://github.com/mmusgrov) PR updated and commits squashed. Thanks for your review. WDYT if we change the JBTM title with a more consistent one? e.g. "Replace synchronized in favor of Reentrant Lock in LRAService joinLRA method'  +1 clearer titles and descriptions help a lot to ease the "cognitive burden". |
