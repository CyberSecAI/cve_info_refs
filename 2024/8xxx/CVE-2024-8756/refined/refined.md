Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-8756:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the `saveUploadedFile` function of the Quform WordPress plugin. This function does not properly restrict access to uploaded files, leading to potential exposure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unauthenticated Sensitive Information Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is that unauthenticated attackers can access and retrieve sensitive information from files uploaded through the Quform plugin. This is due to the lack of proper access controls on the uploaded files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Exposure of Personally Identifiable Information (PII):** Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive data, including PII, contained within the uploaded files.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-based attack:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely through HTTP requests.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** Attackers do not require any authentication to exploit this vulnerability, making it easier to target vulnerable sites.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Attackers need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress instance.
- No specific user roles or privileges are needed. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability without any valid credentials.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including version 2.20.0.
- Files uploaded through forms created before version 2.21.0 remain vulnerable even after upgrading to version 2.21.0. To fully patch the vulnerability, administrators must download and delete previously uploaded files and forms, and re-create the forms after updating.
