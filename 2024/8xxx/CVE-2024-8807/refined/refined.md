Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-8807:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied strings before they are used to execute a system call within the web service of Cohesive Networks VNS3.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. The web service fails to sanitize input strings, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into system calls.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The core issue is the absence of proper input validation. This allows malicious data to be passed directly to system functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the affected VNS3 installation.
- **Root Privileges:** The injected code is executed in the context of the root user, granting the attacker complete control over the system.
- **Full System Compromise:** An attacker can gain complete control over the affected VNS3 controller.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Access:** The attack is performed remotely over the network.
- **Web Service:** The vulnerability is located within the web service of the VNS3 product, which listens on TCP port 8000 by default.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the VNS3 controller on TCP port 8000.
- **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability, making it easier to exploit.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was reported by Mehmet INCE (@mdisec) from PRODAFT.com.
- Cohesive Networks has released updates to address this vulnerability in versions 6.2.8+ and 6.6.7+. Live patches are also available.
- It is essential to restrict access to the VNS3 control plane port (TCP 8000) to prevent exploitation.
- Affected product versions include:
  - VNS3 4.6.1+ (EOL – Upgrade)
  - VNS3 5.0.x (EOL – Upgrade)
  - VNS3 5.1.x (EOL – Upgrade)
  - VNS3 5.2.0-5.2.11 (EOL – Upgrade)
  - VNS3 5.2.12 LTS (Upgrade or request patching support)
  - VNS3 6.0.0-6.0.20 (EOL – Upgrade)
  - VNS3 6.1.1-6.1.4 (EOL – Upgrade)
  - VNS3 6.1.5-6.1.9 (Upgrade or request patching support)
  - VNS3 6.2.0-6.2.7 (Upgrade or request patching support)
  - VNS3 6.6.0-6.6.5 (Upgrade or request patching support)
