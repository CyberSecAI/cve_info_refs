- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A race condition vulnerability exists in the `managedoverlayimages.cgi` endpoint of the VAPIX API.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Race condition, allowing an attacker to block access to the overlay configuration page.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can block access to the overlay configuration page in the web interface of the Axis device.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation is achieved through the VAPIX API's `managedoverlayimages.cgi` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must authenticate to the Axis device with an operator- or administrator-privileged service account.
