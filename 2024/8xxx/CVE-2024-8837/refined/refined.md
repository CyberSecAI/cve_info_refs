- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of XPS files, leading to a read operation beyond the bounds of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running the PDF-XChange Editor.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by enticing the victim to visit a malicious page or open a crafted malicious XPS file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious XPS file or trick the victim into visiting a malicious web page. The user has to interact (open file/visit page) for the exploit to work.
