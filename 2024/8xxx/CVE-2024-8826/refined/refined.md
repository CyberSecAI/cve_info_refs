{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of XPS files, leading to a read past the end of an allocated object.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves a user opening a malicious XPS file or visiting a malicious web page containing a malicious XPS file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious XPS file. The user must then interact with the malicious file or visit a malicious page. No special privileges are needed."
