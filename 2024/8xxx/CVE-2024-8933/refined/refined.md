- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper Enforcement of Message Integrity During Transmission in a Communication Channel
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability exists due to improper enforcement of message integrity, which allows an attacker to inject themselves into the logical network during project file uploads/downloads. This results in retrieval of password hashes
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to retrieval of password hashes, denial of service, and loss of confidentiality and integrity of controllers.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to inject themselves inside the logical network while a valid user uploads or downloads a project file into the controller.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be positioned within the same logical network as the controller and the user's engineering workstation and needs to be present during project file upload/download operation.
