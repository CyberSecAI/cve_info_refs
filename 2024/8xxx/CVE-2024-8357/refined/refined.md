Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-8357:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of a properly configured hardware root of trust within the application system-on-chip (SoC) of Visteon Infotainment systems. This missing immutable root of trust allows for exploitation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Hardware Root of Trust:** The core issue is the absence of a secure, unchangeable foundation for the system's security, which is critical for ensuring that the system boots and operates securely.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The advisory notes that while authentication is required, the existing authentication mechanisms can be bypassed, although the specific method of bypass is not detailed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can elevate their privileges to execute arbitrary code within the context of the boot process.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run any code they choose on the infotainment system, potentially leading to complete control.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the affected infotainment system.
*  **Authentication Bypass:** Although authentication is mentioned, it can be bypassed, indicating the vulnerability can be exploited even without valid credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the Visteon Infotainment system.
*   **Ability to Bypass Authentication:** While authentication exists, the attacker needs the ability to bypass these mechanisms to exploit the underlying privilege escalation vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory classifies this as a zero-day vulnerability at the time of reporting, as it was actively being exploited without a patch available.
*   The only mitigation strategy suggested is to restrict interaction with the application.
*   The CVSS score is 7.8, indicating a high severity issue with impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
