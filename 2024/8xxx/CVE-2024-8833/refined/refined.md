{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the parsing of XPS files where user-supplied data is not properly validated.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds read due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing XPS files.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by enticing a user to open a malicious XPS file or visit a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a malicious XPS file or host a malicious webpage that, when accessed, triggers the vulnerability. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability."
