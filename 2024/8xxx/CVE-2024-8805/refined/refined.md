- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists due to a lack of authorization checks within the implementation of the HID over GATT Profile in BlueZ.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control, leading to the ability to bypass authorization checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-adjacent attackers can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a network-adjacent position to the vulnerable system. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
