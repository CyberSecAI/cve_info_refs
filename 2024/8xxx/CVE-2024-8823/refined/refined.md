- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of JB2 files within PDF-XChange Editor. This results in a read operation that goes beyond the boundaries of an allocated object.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can disclose sensitive information. In conjunction with other vulnerabilities, the attacker may be able to achieve arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to open a malicious PDF file or visit a malicious page. User interaction is required for successful exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious JB2 file to the victim.
