The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the `update.php` file of the `online-exam-mastering-system-php` project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the direct embedding of the `$_GET['eid']` parameter into SQL queries without any validation or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The lack of sanitization of user-provided input allows for the execution of arbitrary SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially read, modify, or delete sensitive data within the database by manipulating the SQL query.
- In the provided example, the attacker can use a time-based blind SQL injection to confirm the vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request with a malicious `eid` parameter in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No prior authentication is required based on the provided information.

The provided information offers more technical details, including a specific vulnerable file (`update.php`), the vulnerable parameter (`eid`), the type of SQL injection (time-based blind), a sample payload, and the usage of sqlmap for exploitation.
