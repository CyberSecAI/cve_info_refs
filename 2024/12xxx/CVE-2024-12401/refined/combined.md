Includes a lot of comments explaining how the maxima were calculated.
This is _very_ conservative, and assumes we're dealing with RSA keys
twice the size of what we actually allow as a maximum.

From running the included benchmark it seems the pathological runtime is
about 13617196ns (13ms) on an M2 Max which seems acceptable.

Includes a lot of comments explaining how the maxima were calculated.
This is _very_ conservative, and assumes we're dealing with RSA keys
twice the size of what we actually allow as a maximum.

From running the included benchmark it seems the pathological runtime is
about 13617196ns (13ms) on an M2 Max which seems acceptable.

Includes a lot of comments explaining how the maxima were calculated.
This is _very_ conservative, and assumes we're dealing with RSA keys
twice the size of what we actually allow as a maximum.

From running the included benchmark it seems the pathological runtime is
about 13617196ns (13ms) on an M2 Max which seems acceptable.

# Potential slowdown / DoS when parsing specially crafted PEM inputs

Low

[SgtCoDFish](/SgtCoDFish)
published
GHSA-r4pg-vg54-wxx4
Nov 20, 2024

## Package

gomod

github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<v1.12.14,<v1.15.4,<v1.16.2

## Patched versions

v1.16.2,v1.15.4,v1.12.14

## Description

### Impact

cert-manager packages which call the standard library `pem.Decode()` function can take a long time to process specially crafted invalid PEM data.

If an attacker is able to modify PEM data which cert-manager reads (e.g. in a Secret resource), they may be able to use large amounts of CPU in the cert-manager controller pod to effectively create a denial-of-service (DoS) vector for cert-manager in the cluster.

Secrets are limited in size to [1MiB](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#restriction-data-size), which reduces the impact of this issue; it was discovered through an ~856kB fuzz test input which causes `pem.Decode` to take roughly 750ms to reject the input on an M2 Max Macbook Pro. By way of comparison, a valid PEM-encoded 4096-bit RSA key takes roughly 70µs to parse on the same machine.

Given the required size of PEM data needed to present a realistic DoS vector, an attacker would need to create or insert many different large sized resources in the cluster, and so the best secondary defense is to ensure that sensible limits are placed via RBAC.

This issue affects all versions of cert-manager to have been released since at least v0.1.0 (since `pem.Decode` is core functionality for cert-manager). All [supported releases](https://cert-manager.io/docs/releases/) are patched.

### Patches

The fixed versions are v1.16.2, v1.15.4 and v1.12.14.

* master branch: [#7400](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/pull/7400)
* release-1.16 branch: [#7401](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/pull/7401)
* release-1.15 branch: [#7402](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/pull/7402)
* release-1.12 branch: [#7403](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/pull/7403)

### Workarounds

Ensure that RBAC is scoped correctly in your cluster. If a user is able to modify resources containing PEM data to be able to exploit this, it's like that those permissions are a bigger security threat than this issue - especially for Secret resources.

### Pull Request Motivation

See [#7400](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/pull/7400) for full context

This backport is smaller than the ones for [release-1.16](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/pull/7401) and [release-1.15](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/pull/7402) because it wasn't easy to cherry-pick the second commit back to this branch. As such, I manually made the changes to replace `pem.Decode` and ignored almost all test code.

### Kind

/kind bug

### Release Note

```
Set a maximum size for PEM inputs which cert-manager will accept to remove possibility of taking a long time to process an input

```

Sorry, something went wrong.

Includes a lot of comments explaining how the maxima were calculated.
This is _very_ conservative, and assumes we're dealing with RSA keys
twice the size of what we actually allow as a maximum.

From running the included benchmark it seems the pathological runtime is
about 13617196ns (13ms) on an M2 Max which seems acceptable.

```
### What did you do?

As part of fuzz testing [sigstore/sigstore#188](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore/issues/188) using oss-fuzz we ran into an issue where the `pem.Decode` is consuming extensive CPU and here is the test case for it <https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore/files/7676542/clusterfuzz-testcase-minimized-FuzzUnmarshalCertificatesFromPEM-4710187355734016.zip>

### What did you expect to see?

The `pem.Decode` finishing sooner than it consumes large amount of CPU

### What did you see instead?

It being slow
