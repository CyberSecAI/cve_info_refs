- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists in the way AnyDesk handles background images. By creating a junction, an attacker can abuse the service to read arbitrary files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information Disclosure. Specifically, the ability to read arbitrary files through a junction.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can disclose sensitive information, including stored credentials, potentially leading to further compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local exploitation through the abuse of the background image handling by creating a junction.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system to exploit the vulnerability.
