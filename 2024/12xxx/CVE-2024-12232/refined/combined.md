## describe

there are unrestricted cross site scripting attacks and injection attacks in the simple-crud-functionality-in-php in index.php. The controllable parameters are as follows: descr parameter and title parameter. This function will execute the user parameter without restriction into the echo statement. Malicious attackers can exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information from clients

**Code analysis**

Line 21-36 in edit.php

```
if(isset($_POST['sub'])){

    if(isset($_POST['srno'])){
        $srno = $_POST['srno'];
        $newtitle = $_POST['newtitle'];
        $newdescr = $_POST['newdescr'];

        $sqledit = "UPDATE `crud`.`notes` SET `Sr.No` = $srno, `title` = '$newtitle', `descr` = '$newdescr', `Time` = NOW() WHERE `notes`.`Sr.No` = $srno;";

        mysqli_query($con, $sqledit);

        header("Location: ./index.php");

mysqli_close($con);
    }
}

```

Line 63-73 in index.php

```
        echo " <tr>
        <td>".$row['Sr.No']."</td>
        <td>".$row['']."</td>
        <td>".$row['descr']."</td>
        <td>".$row['Time']."</td>
        <td>
         <a href='edit.php'><button name='edit' class='sub'>Edit</button></a>
             <a href='delete.php'><button type='submit' name='delete' class='sub'>Delete</button></a>

        </td>
    </tr>";

```
