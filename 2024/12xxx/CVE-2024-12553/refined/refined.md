- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authorization checks
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can leverage the vulnerability to disclose stored credentials, potentially leading to further compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials to the application, but default guest credentials may be used.
