The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Hospital Management System (PHP & MySQL) v1.0, specifically within the `/staff.php` file.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the application directly incorporating user input from the `tel` parameter into SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection
- Lack of input validation and sanitization

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to the database.
- Sensitive data leakage.
- Data tampering or deletion.
- Complete system control.
- Service disruptions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The `tel` parameter in the `/staff.php` file via HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No authentication or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability, meaning an attacker can exploit it remotely without needing any prior access.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable system and to inject SQL code into the vulnerable parameter.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited using both Boolean-Based Blind SQL Injection and Time-Based Blind SQL Injection techniques.
- The content provides example payloads for both types of SQL injection.
- The content shows how to exploit the vulnerability with `sqlmap`, a tool for SQL injection testing.
