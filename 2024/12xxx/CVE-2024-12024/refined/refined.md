{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the em_ticket_category_data and em_ticket_individual_data parameters.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Unauthenticated attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever an administrative user accesses an injected page.",
  "Attack vectors": "By submitting a crafted request to the affected endpoint, an unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious scripts.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need any privileges. The only requirement is that the 'Guest Submissions' setting is enabled (which is disabled by default)."
