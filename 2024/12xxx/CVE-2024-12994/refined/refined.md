The provided content describes a deserialization vulnerability in Datart version 1.0.0-rc.3 or earlier.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `extractModel(MultipartFile file)` method within the `datart.server.service.impl.VizServiceImpl` class. This method directly deserializes the contents of an uploaded file using `ObjectInputStream` without proper validation or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Unsafe deserialization of user-supplied data.
- Lack of input validation and sanitization on the uploaded file.
- Usage of `ObjectInputStream` to directly deserialize the file content, which is vulnerable to object injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by uploading a malicious serialized object.
- Full server compromise: The attacker could gain complete control over the affected server and perform any action.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  Uploading a malicious file via the `/import` endpoint, which passes the file to the vulnerable `extractModel` method.
- The vulnerability is exposed through the `importViz` method.
- HTTP POST request to the `/import` endpoint with a file parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to authenticate to the application, as the login process is required to access the vulnerable `/import` endpoint.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious serialized object using tools like ysoserial or similar means and deliver this to the vulnerable endpoint
