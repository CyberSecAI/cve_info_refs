Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check on the `lps_generate_temp_access_url` AJAX action within the "Custom Login Page Styler" WordPress plugin. This means that the plugin doesn't verify if the user initiating this action has the necessary permissions to do so.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is the lack of a capability check before executing the `lps_generate_temp_access_url` AJAX action. This allows unauthorized users to trigger the function.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting the missing authorization, a user with lower privileges (Subscriber level and above) can generate a temporary access URL, potentially gaining access to other user accounts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with subscriber-level access (or higher) could generate a temporary access URL that allows them to impersonate or gain access to other users on the site, including those with administrator privileges. This can lead to full site compromise.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** The attacker can potentially bypass the normal login process using the generated temporary access, gaining unauthorized entry to the targeted accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP requests to the vulnerable AJAX action.
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have an existing account on the WordPress site (at least subscriber level)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Existing User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the WordPress website, with a minimum role of "Subscriber".
*   **Network access:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the target website
*   **Understanding of the plugin's AJAX actions:** Needs to know or discover the `lps_generate_temp_access_url` AJAX endpoint.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was found in all versions of the plugin up to and including 7.1.1.
*   The fix is included in version 7.1.2
*   The vulnerable function `lps_generate_temp_access_url` was not properly checking user permissions before allowing execution.
*   The code changesets also show the addition of a permission check before resetting settings and additional checks for administrator access for the revoke access functionality.
