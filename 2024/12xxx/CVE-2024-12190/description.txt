The Contact Form by Bit Form: Multi Step Form, Calculation Contact Form, Payment Contact Form & Custom Contact Form builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the bitform-form-entry-edit endpoint in all versions up to, and including,  2.17.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to view all form submissions from other users.
