Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-12190:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Missing capability check on the `bitform-form-entry-edit` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The plugin fails to properly verify if a user has the necessary permissions to access form submission data. Specifically, it lacks a check to ensure the user has 'edit_posts', 'manage_bitform' or 'bitform_entry_edit' capability prior to granting access to form entries. The fix implemented in version 2.17.4 replaced the `edit_posts` check with `manage_options` as the correct capability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Access:** Authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access (or higher) can view all form submissions, including those from other users. This can expose sensitive information submitted through forms.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by accessing the `bitform-form-entry-edit` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated WordPress user with at least Subscriber-level access. No special privileges are required beyond a standard user account.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in versions up to and including 2.17.3.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 2.17.4 by changing the capability check to `manage_options` instead of `edit_posts`.
