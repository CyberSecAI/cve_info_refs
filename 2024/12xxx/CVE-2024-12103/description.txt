The Content No Cache: prevent specific content from being cached plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 0.1.2 via the eos_dyn_get_content action due to insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract data from password protected, private, or draft posts that they should not have access to.
