Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12103

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included when using the `eos_dyn_get_content` action. Specifically, the plugin does not properly check post permissions before retrieving and displaying content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Inadequate Authorization Checks:** The plugin lacks proper checks to ensure that only authorized users can access content. It retrieves and displays content from posts regardless of their status (private, draft, password-protected), as long as the post ID is provided.
*  **Information Exposure:** The vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive data, including private and password-protected posts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Private Content Disclosure:** Unauthenticated attackers can retrieve the content of private, password-protected, or draft posts.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct Request to the `eos_dyn_get_content` action:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a request to the vulnerable action, providing the ID of the desired post, which then returns the content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** Attackers do not need to be logged in or have any special privileges on the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of Post IDs:** Attackers need to know or be able to guess the IDs of posts they want to access.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.
