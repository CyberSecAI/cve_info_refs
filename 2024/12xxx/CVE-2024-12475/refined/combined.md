### Description

The WP Multi Store Locator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

Not PHP 8 compatible
Coding issues that stem from YEARS ago that still aren’t fixed (for example, adding a / in a path when the variable before it also gives a trailing /, resulting in a // in your URL which breaks any sort of CDN delivery)
Multiple instances of calling includes (like the google maps v3 utility infobox, bootstrap modal js, etc) that are BEYOND outdated, and some don’t even exist at the called location anymore
Won’t actually give you any support (even for legit coding issues like above) without paying for support

The WP Multi Store Locator is a great plugin, but the support is world class. The team worked hard on my problem, even though I don’t have the paid version of the plugin yet. They kept testing code changes on my site until the issue was resolved.
For that, my heartfelt thanks.
