  | 70 |  |  |
  | 71 |  | \*\*Under Your Control\*\* |
  | 72 |  |  |
  | 73 |  | THE OLD WAY |
  | 74 |  | Big name hosts & SaaS platforms love their Reselling/Partner Programs, where you’re forced to play by the rules of their closed platform. You get limited control over billing, branding and your customer data and you’re being restricted to the business model that works best for them, not for you. |
  | 75 |  |  |
  | 76 |  | And here’s hoping that someday they will add that feature that you’ve been asking about for the last two years. Sounds familiar? |
  | 77 |  |  |
  | 78 |  | THE DOLLIE WAY |
  | 79 |  | With Dollie you get the freedom to build the exact platform you want, 100% under your control. Your customers, your service, your pricing. We act as a truly invisible partner at all times, managing your cloud infrastructure and constantly adding new white-label features you can then sell directly to your customers. |
  | 80 |  |  |
  | 81 |  | With Dollie you get all the scale, speed and security that those big platforms offer, but without us getting in the way of how you should run your business. Like it should be. |
  | 82 |  |  |
  | 83 |  | \*\*Made to Scale\*\* |
  | 84 |  | THE OLD WAY |
  | 85 |  | Slow (shared) hosting setups with bloated cPanel dashboards. Complex WordPress multisite setups on a single server that won’t scale and can’t be adapted on a per customer basis. Restrictive & expensive managed hosting platforms with zero freedom & flexibility. Figure-it-all-out-yourself Cloud Platforms that require an entire DevOps team to manage with support that does not understand WordPress. |
  | 86 |  |  |
  | 87 |  | Our partners have tried them all before they found Dollie, and they would not want to go back to any of them. |
  | 88 |  |  |
  | 89 |  | THE DOLLIE WAY |
  | 90 |  | Dollie launched exclusively for the Enterprise more than 5 years ago, we live and breathe WordPress & Cloud Technology. |
  | 91 |  |  |
  | 92 |  | Our engineers used many decades of combined experience to build a highly scalable container-based infrastructure that scales, whether you have 5 or 5000 sites on your platform. |
  | 93 |  |  |
  | 94 |  | Today Dollie is a true next-generation cloud platform dedicated to spinning up lightning fast WordPress sites in seconds completely under your brand & domain, available to anyone who wants to change the way they run their WordPress business. |
  | 95 |  |  |
  | 96 |  | \*\*Easy to Get Started\*\* |
  | 97 |  | THE OLD WAY |
  | 98 |  | If you’ve tried to launch a platform before, you know how you have to be an expert on everything. Managing your own tech stack, worrying about security, scaling and performance 24/7, figuring out everything as you go along. |
  | 99 |  |  |
  | 100 |  | Not to mention the upfront financial risks you need to take to be able to compete with the competition. This is exactly why established hosts have been able to take the bulk of the revenue in the WordPress industry for so long. |
  | 101 |  |  |
  | 102 |  | THE DOLLIE WAY |
  | 103 |  | With Dollie you can offer the same features as big name hosts and SaaS website builder platforms, without the hassle and required starting capital. |
  | 104 |  |  |
  | 105 |  | You don’t need to worry about infrastructure, security and scale, our engineers take care of all of that behind the scenes. You only get charged for the amount of sites active on your platform. |
  | 106 |  |  |
  | 107 |  | There are also no starting costs and hidden  surprises. Grow at your own pace knowing exactly how much you have to pay us, before you charge your customers for your services. |
  | 108 |  |  |
  | 109 |  | \*\*Flexible & Extendable\*\* |
  | 110 |  | THE OLD WAY |
  | 111 |  | You want to add a new payment method for your customers but your 3rd Party billing solution does not want to add support for it. There is this CRM solution you want to try but it sets you back another $500 a month for even the basic features. Your team is constantly switching between countless (paid) solutions to manage your customer/client sites. With no end in sight. |
  | 112 |  |  |
  | 113 |  | This is the reality for most people trying to build a consistent experience for their customers. |
  | 114 |  |  |
  | 115 |  | THE DOLLIE WAY |
  | 116 |  | With Dollie you can install any of the thousands of WordPress plugins and WooCommerce extensions to add features to your platform, simply nothing will hold you back. |
  | 117 |  |  |
  | 118 |  | You have the flexibility, to enhance your platform using any free and premium |
  | 119 |  | WordPress plugins, or even build your own should you come accross a unique scenario that is important for your |
  | 120 |  | project. |
  | 121 |  |  |
  | 122 |  | Your team already knows WordPress, so we wanted to make it as easy as possible for you to build something awesome. |
  | 123 |  |  |
  | 124 |  | \*\*Integrates Seamlessly With Your Theme & Plugins\*\* |
  | 125 |  | Simply install this Dollie plugin inside your existing WordPress installation and let your customers launch sites with the click of a button. |
  | 126 |  |  |
  | 127 |  |  |
  | 128 |  | ## Get Started For Free |
  | 129 |  |  |
  | 130 |  | To start using Dollie you can create a free account to try out the platform and launch some fully functional sites under your own domain for free. Simply install this Dollie Hub plugin and you'll be guided through the entire process. |

  | 151 |  | Appsero SDK does not gather any data by default. The SDK only starts gathering basic telemetry data \*\*when a user allows it via the admin notice\*\*. We collect the data to ensure a great user experience for all our users. |

### Description

The Dollie Hub – Build Your Own WordPress Cloud Platform plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 6.2.0 via the 'elementor-template' shortcode due to insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract data from password protected, private, or draft posts that they should not have access to.
