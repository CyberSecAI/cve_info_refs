Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-12099:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control within the 'elementor-template' shortcode of the Dollie Hub plugin. The plugin fails to properly restrict which posts can be accessed through this shortcode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Authorization Bypass:** The primary weakness is an authorization bypass vulnerability. The plugin doesn't enforce proper checks on post visibility when using the 'elementor-template' shortcode.
- **Information Exposure:** The vulnerability leads to information exposure, allowing unauthorized access to post content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Data Leakage:** An attacker can extract content from password-protected, private, or draft posts, which they should not have permission to view. This could expose sensitive information depending on the content of the posts.
- **Confidentiality Violation:** The vulnerability compromises the confidentiality of potentially sensitive data within WordPress posts.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Shortcode Exploitation:** The attack is carried out by using the vulnerable `elementor-template` shortcode with a post ID as a parameter, to retrieve the content of posts, regardless of access restrictions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user on the WordPress site, with at least "Contributor" level permissions. This means they have the ability to create posts, but not necessarily manage the whole site.
- **Knowledge of Post IDs:** To target specific content, the attacker would need to know the IDs of the private, password protected, or draft posts they want to access.
