- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Three flaws contributed to the Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):
    1. Unauthenticated users could create new URL mappings in the URL Mapper component.
    2. The URL Mapper component had a flaw that allowed manipulation of created URL mappings to access unintended resources.
    3. The URL Mapper container had access to internal resources it did not require.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
    - Unauthenticated access to URL Mapper functionality.
    - Inadequate component isolation
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Denial of Service (DoS) by creating recursive calls within the URL Mapper.
    - Data exfiltration.
    - Downloading and changing configurations.
    - Pushing data and configurations to the Hub without access credentials.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote, unauthenticated attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to make network requests to the vulnerable Arctic Hub instance. The attacker does not need any prior access credentials or specific knowledge of the internal workings of the URL Mapper. The attacker does need knowledge of internal operation and component names of the Arctic Hub, which are not publicly exposed, in order to expand from a DOS to a SSRF.
