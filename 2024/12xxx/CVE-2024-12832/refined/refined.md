- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of proper validation of user-supplied strings before using them to construct SQL queries within the `ReportEntry` class.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can create arbitrary files and disclose sensitive information. Attackers can leverage this vulnerability in conjunction with others to potentially execute arbitrary code as the `www-data` user.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote, network-based attacks. Authentication is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker requires valid credentials to interact with the application.
