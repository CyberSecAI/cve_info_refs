### Description

The Rate My Post – Star Rating Plugin by FeedbackWP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.4 via the get\_post\_status() due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to vote on unpublished scheduled posts.
