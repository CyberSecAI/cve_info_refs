The provided content is related to CVE-2024-12595.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize the `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` parameter before outputting it within an attribute.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is triggered by a crafted URL containing the malicious payload in the `REQUEST_URI`, specifically within the `page=share_report`, `order` and `cat` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking a specially crafted link, and the user must be using a web browser that is susceptible to this vulnerability (older browsers are specifically mentioned).
