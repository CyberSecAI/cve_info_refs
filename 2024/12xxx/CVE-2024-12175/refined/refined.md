Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-12175:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A "use after free" vulnerability exists within the Rockwell Automation Arena software. This occurs when the software attempts to access a memory resource that has already been deallocated or freed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free condition (CWE-416)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to run malicious code on the affected system, potentially leading to complete compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious DOE file. The software is then forced to use already freed resources when processing the crafted file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious DOE file.
- A legitimate user must then execute the malicious DOE file.

**Additional details:**
- This vulnerability is present in Arena software versions 16.20.06 and prior, and it's fixed in version 16.20.07 and later.
- The advisory suggests avoiding loading untrusted Arena model files and holding down the control key when loading files as mitigations.
- The CVSS v3.1 score is 7.8, and the CVSS v4.0 score is 8.5, indicating a high severity.
