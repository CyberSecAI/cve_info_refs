**VULNERABILITY DETAILS**

Rockwell Automation used the latest version of the CVSS scoring system to assess the following vulnerabilities. The following vulnerabilities were reported by ZDI (Zero Day Initiative).

**CVE-2024-11155 IMPACT**

A “use after free”  code execution vulnerability exists in the affected products that could allow a threat actor to craft a DOE file and force the software to use a resource that was already used. If exploited, a threat actor could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code. To exploit this vulnerability, a legitimate user must execute the malicious code crafted by the threat actor.

**CVSS 3.1 Base Score:** 7.8

**CVSS 3.1 Vector:** [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**CVSS 4.0 Base Score:** 8.5

**CWE**:  CWE-416 Use After Free

**Known Exploited Vulnerability (KEV) database:** No

**CVE-2024-11156 IMPACT**

An “out of bounds write”  code execution vulnerability exists in the affected products that could allow a threat actor to write beyond the boundaries of allocated memory in a DOE file. If exploited, a threat actor could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code. To exploit this vulnerability, a legitimate user must execute the malicious code crafted by the threat actor.

**CVSS 3.1 Base Score:** 7.8

**CWE**:  CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write

**Known Exploited Vulnerability (KEV) database:** No

**CVE-2024-11158 IMPACT**

An “uninitialized variable”  code execution vulnerability exists in the affected products that could allow a threat actor to craft a DOE file and force the software to access a variable before it being initialized. If exploited, a threat actor could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code. To exploit this vulnerability, a legitimate user must execute the malicious code crafted by the threat actor.

**CVSS 3.1 Base Score:** 7.8

**Mitigations and Workarounds**

Customers using the affected software are encouraged to apply these risk mitigations, if possible.

* Do not load untrusted Arena® model files.
* Hold the control key down when loading files to help prevent the VBA file stream from loading.

For information on how to mitigate Security Risks on industrial automation control systems, we encourage customers to implement our suggested [security best practices](https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1085012/loc/en_US#__highlight) to minimize the risk of the vulnerability.
