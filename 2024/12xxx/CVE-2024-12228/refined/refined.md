The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the `/admin/user-search.php` file of the "Complaint Management system" version 1.0, a PHP project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient user input validation of the 'search' parameter in the `/admin/user-search.php` file. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries directly into the SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection in the `/admin/user-search.php` file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized database access.
- Sensitive data leakage.
- Data tampering.
- Comprehensive system control.
- Service interruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker can inject malicious SQL queries via the 'search' parameter.
- No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, specifically to the `/admin/user-search.php` file.
- No authentication is required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited using various SQL injection techniques: boolean-based blind, error-based, time-based blind, and UNION query.
- The provided payloads and sqlmap command-line demonstrate proof of concept.
- The suggested remediation steps include using prepared statements, input validation, minimizing database user permissions, and regular security audits.
