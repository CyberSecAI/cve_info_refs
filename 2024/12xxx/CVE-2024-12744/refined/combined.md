# SQL Injection in the Amazon Redshift JDBC Driver affecting v2.1.0.31

High

[zurowskik](/zurowskik)
published
GHSA-8596-2jgr-ppj7
Dec 24, 2024

## Package

maven

com.amazon.redshift:redshift-jdbc42
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

2.1.0.31

## Patched versions

2.1.0.32

## Description

### Summary

A SQL injection in the Amazon Redshift JDBC Driver in v2.1.0.31 allows a user to gain escalated privileges via schema injection in the getSchemas, getTables, or getColumns Metadata APIs. Users should upgrade to the driver version 2.1.0.32 or revert to driver version 2.1.0.30.

### Impact

A SQL injection is possible in the Amazon Redshift JDBC Driver, version 2.1.0.31, when leveraging metadata APIs to retrieve information about database schemas, tables, or columns.

**Impacted versions:** Amazon Redshift JDBC Driver version 2.1.0.31.

### Patches

The issue described above has been addressed in the Amazon Redshift JDBC Driver, version 2.1.0.32.

The patch implemented in this version ensures that every metadata command input is sent to the Redshift server as part of a parameterized query, using either QUOTE\_IDENT(string) or QUOTE\_LITERAL(string). After processing all the inputs into quoted identifiers or literals, the metadata command is composed using these inputs and then executed on the server.

### Workarounds

Use the previous version of the Amazon Redshift JDBC Driver, 2.1.0.30.

### References

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory we ask that you contact AWS/Amazon Security via our vulnerability reporting page [1] or directly via email to aws-security@amazon.com. Please do not create a public GitHub issue.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
