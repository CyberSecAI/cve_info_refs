{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The MIME type check for \"image/svg+xml\" was case-sensitive, allowing bypass by sending a request with a manipulated MIME type such as \"image/svg+XML\".",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Case-sensitive MIME type validation leading to potential bypass.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The original vulnerability, CVE-2022-30110, is related to a stored XSS vulnerability, so successful bypass of the MIME check could allow an attacker to upload malicious SVG files leading to XSS.",
  "Attack vectors": "Manipulated HTTP requests with a case-modified MIME type.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and upload files."
