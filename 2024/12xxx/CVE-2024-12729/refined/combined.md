## Overview

Sophos has resolved three independent security vulnerabilities in Sophos Firewall.

No action is required for Sophos Firewall customers with the "Allow automatic installation of hotfixes" feature enabled on remediated versions (see *Remediation* section below). Enabled is the default setting.

| **CVE ID** | **Description** | **Severity** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CVE-2024-12727** | A pre-auth SQL injection vulnerability in the email protection feature allowing access to the reporting database of Sophos Firewall could lead to remote code execution, if a specific configuration of Secure PDF eXchange (SPX) is enabled in combination with the firewall running in High Availability (HA) mode. The issue, impacting about 0.05% of devices, was discovered and responsibly disclosed to Sophos by an external security researcher via the Sophos bug bounty program. | CRITICAL |
| **CVE-2024-12728** | The suggested and non-random SSH login passphrase for High Availability (HA) cluster initialization remained active after the HA establishment process completed, potentially exposing a privileged system account on the Sophos Firewall if SSH is enabled, affecting approximately 0.5% of devices. The issue was discovered by Sophos during internal security testing. | CRITICAL |
| **CVE-2024-12729** | A post-auth code injection vulnerability in the User Portal allowing authenticated users to gain remote code execution was discovered and responsibly disclosed to Sophos by an external security researcher via the Sophos bug bounty program. | HIGH |

## Verifying the hotfix

* To confirm that the hotfix has been applied to your firewall, please refer to [KBA-000010084](https://support.sophos.com/support/s/article/KBA-000010084)

## Workaround

### CVE-2024-12728

To mitigate the issue of the SSH passphrase (used during [deployment of HA ports](https://docs.sophos.com/nsg/sophos-firewall/latest/Help/en-us/webhelp/onlinehelp/HighAvailablityStartupGuide/HARequirements/HAPorts/index.html)) remaining active, customers can ensure that:

* SSH access is restricted to only the dedicated HA link that is physically separate, and/or
* HA is reconfigured using a sufficiently long and random *custom* passphrase

Sophos recommends to disable WAN access via SSH by following [device access best practices](https://docs.sophos.com/nsg/sophos-firewall/latest/Help/en-us/webhelp/onlinehelp/AdministratorHelp/Administration/DeviceAccess/index.html) and instead use VPN and/or Sophos Central for remote access and management.

### CVE-2024-12729

Customers can protect themselves from external attackers by ensuring their User Portal and Webadmin are not exposed to WAN.

Sophos recommends to disable WAN access to the User Portal and Webadmin by following [device access best practices](https://docs.sophos.com/nsg/sophos-firewall/latest/Help/en-us/webhelp/onlinehelp/AdministratorHelp/Administration/DeviceAccess/index.html) and instead use VPN and/or Sophos Central for remote access and management.
