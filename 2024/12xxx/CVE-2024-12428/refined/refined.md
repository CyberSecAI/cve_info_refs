Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12428

**Vulnerability Description:**
The WP Data Access – App, Table, Form and Chart Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input within the `order[user_login][dir]` parameter. Specifically, the plugin doesn't properly sanitize the `dir` value before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection, allowing an attacker to manipulate the SQL queries executed by the plugin. This is due to the lack of sufficient preparation of the existing SQL query and insufficient escaping of user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to append malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database.
- **Potential for further attacks:** This could also be a starting point for more severe attacks, like data modification or complete takeover of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be launched remotely over the network.
- **HTTP Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code via the `order[user_login][dir]` parameter, which is part of the HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Affected Versions:**
- All versions of the WP Data Access – App, Table, Form and Chart Builder plugin up to and including 5.5.22.

**Patched Version:**
- Version 5.5.23

**Additional Notes**
- The provided diff from the WordPress Plugin directory shows the fix involves adding `sanitize_sql_orderby` to the `column` parameter.
