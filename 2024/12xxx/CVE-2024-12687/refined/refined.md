Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2024-12687:

**Root Cause:**
- An unsafe default within an open-source dependency was identified. This dependency is used for handling the import of runbooks data into the PlexTrac platform.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**
- **Insecure YAML Deserialization:** The open-source dependency, by default, used an unsafe method for parsing YAML data, which could lead to code execution during the runbooks import process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server where the PlexTrac platform is running.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Runbooks Import:** The vulnerability is triggered during the process of importing runbooks data into the platform. An attacker would need to craft a malicious YAML file and upload it as a runbook.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to have the ability to upload/import runbooks data into the PlexTrac platform. This typically requires a valid user account with the necessary permissions.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present within a *legacy runbooks importer*.
- PlexTrac resolved the issue by modifying the code to use a safer method for handling the parsing of runbooks data files.
