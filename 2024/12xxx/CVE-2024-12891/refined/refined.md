Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the direct inclusion of the `$_GET['eid']` parameter into SQL queries within the `account.php` file without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where attacker-controlled input is incorporated into SQL queries, allowing the attacker to manipulate the query logic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker can potentially modify or retrieve unintended data from the database.
- **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, which could lead to data breaches, data modification, or potentially complete control of the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter:** The attack vector is the `eid` parameter in the HTTP GET request to `account.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application.
- **Understanding of SQL Syntax:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge of SQL syntax to craft a malicious payload.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code resides in `account.php`.
- The `eid` parameter from the HTTP GET request is directly used in the SQL query.
- The provided payload demonstrates how an attacker can insert SQL code into the `eid` parameter to manipulate the query:
`http://host/account.php?q=quiz&step=2&eid=5589741f9ed52' AND (SELECT 9913 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))emka) AND 'nnHe'='nnHe&n=1&t=5`
- The SQL injection can be exploited using tools like SQLmap as demonstrated in the content
`sqlmap -u "/account.php?q=quiz&step=2&eid=5589741f9ed52&n=1&t=5" -p eid --batch"`
