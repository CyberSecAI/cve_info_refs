The Tickera â€“ WordPress Event Ticketing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.4.8 via the 'tickera_tickets_info' endpoint. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data from bookings like full names, email addresses, check-in/out timestamps and more.
