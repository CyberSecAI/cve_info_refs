Based on the provided advisory, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from incorrect authorization within the `uvm_login` module of the Arista NG Firewall.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The core weakness is an authorization bypass that allows a local attacker to gain elevated privileges.

*   **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to privilege escalation, granting the attacker access to resources that are normally protected from the user. The impact is rated with a CVSS score of 6.6, with Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability impacts (C:H/I:L/A:L).

*  **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have existing low-privileged code execution on the target system.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target Arista NG Firewall system before exploiting this vulnerability.

The advisory provides more detail than the basic CVE description by specifying the affected module (`uvm_login`), the exact authorization issue, and the requirement for existing local code execution.
