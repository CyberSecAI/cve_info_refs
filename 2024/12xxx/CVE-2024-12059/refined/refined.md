Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-12059:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `eli_option_value` shortcode within the ElementInvader Addons for Elementor WordPress plugin. This allows authenticated users, even with low-level permissions like "Contributor," to read arbitrary options from the `wp_options` table.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The `eli_option_value` shortcode does not properly validate user privileges before retrieving option values.
- **Arbitrary Option Read:**  The shortcode could be used to extract potentially sensitive information stored in the `wp_options` table.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can retrieve arbitrary options stored in the `wp_options` table, which may contain sensitive data such as API keys, database credentials, site URLs, and other configuration information.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** By obtaining sensitive information, attackers can potentially escalate their attacks, gain unauthorized access, or compromise the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited using the `eli_option_value` shortcode.
- An attacker must be an authenticated user, with at least "Contributor" role privileges.
- The attacker can insert this shortcode into a post or page content, which the plugin processes without proper authorization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have a valid account on the target WordPress site with at least "Contributor" level permissions.
- **Knowledge of Shortcodes:** The attacker must be familiar with how WordPress shortcodes function to be able to use the `eli_option_value` shortcode.

**Additional Notes from the provided content:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.3.2 of the plugin.
- The fix involves adding a security key check, and a whitelist of options that can be read by the shortcode.
- The fix also addresses an issue related to displaying private/protected pages in the blog popup.
