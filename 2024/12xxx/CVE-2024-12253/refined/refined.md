Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the Simple Ecommerce Shopping Cart plugin for WordPress. Specifically, the plugin fails to verify user capabilities before allowing actions related to saving settings, exporting data, and other plugin actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Settings Modification:** An attacker with subscriber-level access or higher can modify the plugin's settings, potentially disrupting functionality or injecting malicious code.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive order and log data, which could include customer information, purchase history, and other business-related details.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** Exploitation occurs via HTTP requests to the vulnerable plugin endpoints.
