Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update for Desktop](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2024/12/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_18.html "Stable Channel Update for Desktop")

Wednesday, December 18, 2024

The Stable channel has been updated to 131.0.6778.204/.205 for Windows, Mac and 131.0.6778.204 for Linux which will roll out over the coming days/weeks. A full list of changes in this build is available in the [Log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/131.0.6778.140..131.0.6778.204?pretty=fuller&n=10000).

Security Fixes and Rewards

Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [5](https://issues.chromium.org/issues?q=customfield1223088:4-M131) security fixes. Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chrome Security Page](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

[$55000][[382291459](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/382291459)] High CVE-2024-12692: Type Confusion in V8. Reported by Seunghyun Lee (@0x10n) on 2024-12-05

[$20000][[382190919](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/382190919)] High CVE-2024-12693: Out of bounds memory access in V8. Reported by 303f06e3 on 2024-12-04

[TBD][[368222741](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/368222741)] High CVE-2024-12694: Use after free in Compositing. Reported by Anonymous on 2024-09-19

[TBD][[383647255](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/383647255)] High CVE-2024-12695: Out of bounds write in V8. Reported by 303f06e3 on 2024-12-12

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[384734545](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/384734545)] Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer](https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/undefinedbehaviorsanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity/), [libFuzzer](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2B/HEAD/testing/libfuzzer/README.md), or [AFL](https://github.com/google/afl).

# Chromium Security

The Chromium security team aims to provide Chrome and Chrome OS users with the
most secure platform to navigate the web, and just generally make the Internet a
safer place to hang out. We work on solutions for the [biggest user / ux
security problems](/Home/chromium-security/enamel), drive [secure architecture
design and implementation projects for the Chromium
platform](/Home/chromium-security/guts), [find and help fix security
bugs](/Home/chromium-security/bugs), [help developers to create more secure
apps](/Home/chromium-security/owp), and act as a [general security consulting /
review group](/Home/chromium-security/reviews-and-consulting) for the larger
Chromium project.

To learn more:

* Read our [core security
  principles](/Home/chromium-security/core-principles), which we try
  to follow in all security work we do.
* Check out our [security brag
  sheet](/Home/chromium-security/brag-sheet), which lists some of the
  technologies and recognition we're most proud of.
* Check out some of the work we're doing to [detect and prevent
  security bugs](/Home/chromium-security/bugs), ensure that Chromium
  is [secure by design and resilient to
  exploitation](/Home/chromium-security/guts), and [make security
  easier for users and developers](/Home/chromium-security/enamel).
* Peruse the [Security
  FAQ](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2B/HEAD/docs/security/faq.md)
  for answers to common questions.
* Learn about how [Security
  Reviews](/Home/chromium-security/security-reviews) work in Chrome.
* Check out some of our [Chrome-specific security
  education](/Home/chromium-security/education) documentation.
* Check out the [PDFium
  Security](/Home/chromium-security/pdfium-security) page, too.
* Here is the canonical "[prefer secure origins for powerful new
  features](/Home/chromium-security/prefer-secure-origins-for-powerful-new-features)"
  proposal text.
* Here is the canonical "[Marking HTTP As
  Non-Secure](/Home/chromium-security/marking-http-as-non-secure)"
  proposal text.
* Have a look at our public [Chrome Security Google Drive
  folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_KwtdC2J1Q6fjFNRElHUHhmLUlNbktKbFVkRXBlVGp0NkZvTDJvZVRZLXozOVFqTWtzM1E&authuser=0),
  which contains a whole bunch of useful documents as well.
* We provide [quarterly
  updates](/Home/chromium-security/quarterly-updates) to what we're
  working on, if anything piques your interest get in touch!
* Find out about [our memory
  safety](/Home/chromium-security/memory-safety) work.

### [How can I get involved?](#how-can-i-get-involved)

**Find bugs**

One of the quickest ways to get involved is finding and [reporting security
bugs](/Home/chromium-security/reporting-security-bugs). It will get prompt
attention from a [security
sheriff](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2B/HEAD/docs/security/sheriff.md),
be kept private until we coordinate disclosure, and possibly qualify for a cash
reward through our [Vulnerability Rewards
Program](/Home/chromium-security/vulnerability-rewards-program). We occasionally
run security contests outside of our regular reward program (e.g.
[Pwnium2](/Home/chromium-security/pwnium-2),
[Pwnium3](/Home/chromium-security/pwnium-3)) too.

For any issues other than a specific bug, email us at
security@chromium.org. For non-confidential
discussions, please post to the [technical discussion
forums](/developers/technical-discussion-groups), including the public
[security-dev](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!forum/security-dev)
list for technical discussions.

**Become a committer**

We encourage interested parties to work towards [becoming a
committer](/getting-involved/become-a-committer). There are many types of
security related patch that we're excited to collaborate on:

* Fixes for any security bugs you discover.
* Implementing or improving security features, including
  security-related web platform features (examples: iframe sandbox,
  XSS auditor, CSP).
* Implementing or improving security hardening measures (examples:
  defensive checks, allocator improvements, ASLR improvements).

**Become an IPC reviewer**

Bugs in IPC can have nasty consequences, so we take special care to make sure
additions or changes to IPC avoid [common security
pitfalls](/Home/chromium-security/education/security-tips-for-ipc). If you want
to get involved, check out how to become an IPC reviewer
[here](/Home/chromium-security/ipc-security-reviews).

**Join the team**

Access to Chromium security bugs and our team mailing list is restricted, for
obvious reasons. Before applying to join the team, applicants must be committers
and are expected to have made and continue to make active and significant
contributions to Chromium security. You should demonstrate some of the following
before applying:

* Relevant technical expertise and a history of patches that improve
  Chromium security.
* A history of identifying and responsibly reporting Chromium security
  vulnerabilities.
* Other expertise and/or roles that would allow the applicant to
  significantly contribute to Chromium security on a regular basis.
* [required]: Be a committer, and have no personal or professional
  association that is an ethical conflict of interest (e.g. keeping
  vulnerabilities or exploits private, or sharing with parties other
  than the vendor).
* [required]: A need to access information about unfixed Chromium security
  bugs in order to build defenses which will benefit multiple
  products that embed Chromium.

The final criterion above can be demonstrated by a strong organizational
track record of benefiting Chromium security, such that it would be clearly
obstructive for an individual to lack access. For example, if an organization
were comprehensively responsible for all Chromium fuzzing, or all of Chromium
supply chain security, it would be obviously necessary for some individuals to
have access to all security bug information.

To apply for membership, please email
security@chromium.org.

### [How can I get access to Chromium vulnerabilities?](#how-can-i-get-access-to-chromium-vulnerabilities)

A history of fixed Chromium security bugs is best found via [security notes in
Stable Channel updates on the Google Chrome releases
blog](https://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/search/label/Stable%20updates).
You can also find fixed, publicly visible Type=Bug-Security bugs in the [issue
tracker](https://crbug.com/) (note: security bugs automatically become publicly
visible 14 weeks after they are fixed). All security bugs are rated according to
our [severity
guidelines](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2B/HEAD/docs/security/severity-guidelines.md),
which we keep in line with industry standards.

Advance notice of (fixed) Chromium security vulnerabilities is restricted to
those actively building significantly deployed products based upon Chromium, or
including Chromium as part of bundled software distributions. If you meet the
criteria, and require advanced notice of vulnerabilities, request access via
security@chromium.org. Your email should explain
your need for access (embedder, Linux distribution, etc.) and your continued
access will require that you follow the terms of list membership.
(This is known as "security-notify" access).

Individuals with such “security-notify” access may additionally request access
to non-embargoed vulnerabilities which are not yet fixed, for which there's
evidence of an exploit existing in the wild. (This is known as
"security-notify-itw" access). The intention here is to allow these extra-urgent
fixes to be distributed to users with minimal delay. To apply for this extra
membership, we require evidence that your users receive all important security
fixes very rapidly, and will therefore benefit from a further reduced fix time
for these fixes.

This evidence must be provided at least every six months and must cover (at
least) all high severity fixes (not just those with evidence of in-the-wild
exploitation). There's no set format for this evidence, but an example might
be a table showing the date each high-severity, stable-impacting fix was made
available to your users. Other equivalent information is also acceptable.
Request and justification artifacts for this membership should be sent to
security@chromium.org.

Irrespective of membership of these groups, individuals are often granted access
to specific Chromium security bugs which they may be able to help fix or progress.

There is one simple rule for any party granted advance access to security
vulnerabilities in Chromium: any details of a vulnerability should be considered
confidential until the vulnerability is responsibly disclosed by the Chromium
project. Information may only be shared with parties who need to know in order
to defend Chromium or directly related software or hardware. Additionally,
any vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies (e.g. Blink, open source parser
libraries, etc.) must be treated with the same consideration. Access will be
terminated immediately for any member who fails to comply with this rule in
letter or spirit.
