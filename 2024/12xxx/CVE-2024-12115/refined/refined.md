**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `duplicate_poll()` function in the Poll Maker plugin lacks proper nonce validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the `duplicate_poll()` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An unauthenticated attacker can duplicate polls by tricking a site administrator into performing an action, such as clicking a link, leading to a forged request.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is exploited via a forged request that is triggered by a user action (e.g., clicking a link).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to trick a site administrator into performing an action like clicking on a malicious link. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to the WordPress site.
