Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-12018:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the Snippet Shortcodes plugin for WordPress. While a nonce is used for authentication, its value is leaked, rendering the check ineffective.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is the lack of proper authorization checks before allowing users to perform actions such as deleting shortcodes.
- **Leaked Nonce:** The nonce intended to provide security is exposed, making it usable by any authenticated user, bypassing the intended access control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Shortcode Deletion:** An attacker with subscriber-level access or higher can delete arbitrary shortcodes within the WordPress site. This could lead to content disruption, loss of functionality, and potentially other malicious impacts depending on how the shortcodes are used.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attack is carried out via network requests to the WordPress site's backend.
- **Authenticated Users:** The attacker must have an authenticated account on the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **WordPress Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the target WordPress site.
- **Subscriber+ Level Access:** The account must have at least a subscriber role, which is a basic WordPress user role.
- **Knowledge of the Leaked Nonce:** The attacker must be able to identify and utilize the leaked nonce value to make the malicious requests.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Snippet Shortcodes plugin versions up to and including 4.1.6.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 4.1.7 by adding the `sh_cd_permission_check()` function to verify user authorization.

**Summary:**
CVE-2024-12018 is an authenticated shortcode deletion vulnerability due to missing authorization checks, which were exploitable by any logged in user with the leaked nonce. An attacker could potentially disrupt site functionality by deleting shortcodes.
