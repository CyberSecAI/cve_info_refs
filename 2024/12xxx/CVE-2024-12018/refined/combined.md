## Description

#### DOCUMENTATON / UPGRADE

[Snippet Shortcodes Website](https://snippet-shortcodes.yeken.uk/ "Snippet Shortcodes Website")

#### WHAT IS SNIPPET SHORTCODES?

Do you want to use the same snippet of text or HTML throughout your site but only have to change the value in one location? If so, this plugin maybe just what you need.

Create your own Shortcodes and assign content to them. Using the standard WP editor, you can add text, HTML, JavaScript, images or other elements that your WordPress install and plugins allow. The main advantage is ability to create a shortcode once and re-use it throughout your site.

[ sv slug=”your-slug-name”]

#### FEATURES

* Create a shortcode once and place in multiple locations.
* Update the shortcode in one location and it changes throughout your site.
* Parameters to extend your shortcodes.
* Free and Premium helper shortcodes to make life easier.
* Multi-site support.
* Process shortcodes within WordPress menu titles.

#### SPECIFY PARAMETERS

In some cases you may wish to make your shortcodes more extendable. This is where parameters come in. For example, you may have a shortcode that renders a HTML table, however, depending on where you place that shortcode on your site, you may wish to specify additional arguments. Take the example below, you can see the additional arguments passed into shortcode, “border”, “background” etc.

[ sv slug=”render-table” border=”0″ background=”#FFFFFF” width=”50%” site-title=”YeKen”]

Each argument can be rendered into the shortcode in the with the following syntax %%background%%, %%width%%, etc. Below is an example:

Welcome to our site, %%site-title%%.

Exactly what I was looking for. Very useful for inserting snippets of texts, copyright notices, HTML, JavaScript, PHP or whatever comes to your mind. When I had an issue with the license key, the developer was very quick to respond and help me out. The lifetime license doesn’t cost the earth. Money well spent.

This free plugin makes life with Wordpress so much easier. It works just fine! I had a proposal and got fast response.
One can edit existing shortcode and create new ones without any problem. Just click large the blue buttom “Add a new Shortcoed Variable” if you want to create another new shortcode or click the symbol “Edit” which is located right of each shortcode just next to the “Delete” icon!
Thanks for this plugin

I installed the plugin and created a shortcode. Coming back later to revise the value of the shortcode, I learned that you cannot change an existing shortcode or add a new one unless you purchase the “premium” edition. This is blatant bait and switch and would be illegal under US law.

Makes build of website so much easier. Had some trouble to get it to work but it was not the fault of the plugin but my editor. Got fast response and support.

Updates are always late by several versions.
As of 01.05.2020, the plugin with version 5.3.3 is not compatible and causes errors with the version of WordPress 5.4.1.
It’s a shame and annoying!

### Description

The Snippet Shortcodes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized Shortcode Deletion due to missing authorization in all versions up to, and including, 4.1.6. Note that a nonce is used as authentication here, but the value is leaked. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete the plugin's Shortcodes.
