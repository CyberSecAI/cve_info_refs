A hidden field manipulation vulnerability was identified in Issuetrak version 17.1 that could be triggered by an authenticated user. 

When an authenticated user submits a ticket, the request can be intercepted and subsequently modified by using a proxy.  The ticket requester can be changed from the original requester to another user in the same application, 
which the application then accepts.
