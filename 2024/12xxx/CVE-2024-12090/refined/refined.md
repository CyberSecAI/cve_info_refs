**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12090

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Product:** ENOVIA Collaborative Industry Innovator

**Affected Version:** Release **3D**EXPERIENCE R2024x

**Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing it, allowing an attacker to inject malicious script code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS): Malicious scripts injected by an attacker are persistently stored on the server (e.g., database). These scripts are executed within the browsers of users who access the affected data/page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary script code in the browser session of other users interacting with the vulnerable application. This may lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing cookies
    - Data theft
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Defacement of the application

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker would need to find an input point within the ENOVIA Collaborative Industry Innovator application where they can inject malicious JavaScript. This data is then stored by the application.
- The malicious script is executed when a user views the stored data, without the need for further interaction from the attacker

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to an account that allows them to input data into the vulnerable application (ENOVIA Collaborative Industry Innovator).
- The attacker needs to craft their malicious script to be able to achieve the goals of the attack

This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of other users.
