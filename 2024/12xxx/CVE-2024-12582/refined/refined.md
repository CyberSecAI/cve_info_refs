The content is related to CVE-2024-12582.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The skupper console, when initialized with the default authentication method, uses a flawed basic authentication implementation. A randomly generated password for the "admin" user is stored in plaintext either in a Kubernetes secret or a podman volume.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Plaintext storage of credentials**: The admin password is saved in a plaintext file.
- **Flawed authentication method:** The authentication method can be manipulated to bypass authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary file read**: An attacker can read any user-readable file in the container filesystem, leading to data confidentiality breaches.
- **Denial of service (DoS):** An attacker can induce skupper to read extremely large files into memory, resulting in resource exhaustion and a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network access to the skupper console is required.
- Manipulation of the flawed authentication method.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the skupper console.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the flawed basic authentication method.
