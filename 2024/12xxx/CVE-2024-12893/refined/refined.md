- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user-supplied input, specifically in the "Tipo de Usuário" (User Type) input field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of other users' sessions. This could lead to information retrieval (sensitive information leakage), or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability is triggered by inserting malicious JavaScript code into the "name" parameter when editing a user type at `Configurações > Permissões > Tipos de Usuários`. The payload is stored in the database and executed when the user views the previous page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to edit user types within the application.
