### Summary

The application fails to properly validate and sanatize user supplied input, hence leading to a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability that resides within the user type (Tipo de Usuário) input field.

### Details

While editing the user type, which can be accessed at Configurações > Permissões > Tipos de Usuários, it's possible to insert arbitrary javascript code which is then stored and executed once the user gets back to the previous page.

### PoC

Edit the user type and insert the payload `"><img src=x onerror=alert('Stored-XSS-PoC-RegularUs3r')>`

[![Pasted image 20241129013428](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c77366a-4d6e-4df1-b023-76716bdd425c)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c77366a-4d6e-4df1-b023-76716bdd425c)

Once the user goes back to the previous page the payload is triggered.

Affected endpoint => `/usuarios/tipos/2`
Affected parameter => `name`

### Impact

Through this attacker vector a malicious user might be able to retrieve information belonging to another user, which may lead to sensitive information leakage or other malicious actions.

### Mitigation

One way to mitigate Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilites in PHP is to use `htmlentities` when parsing user supplied input
