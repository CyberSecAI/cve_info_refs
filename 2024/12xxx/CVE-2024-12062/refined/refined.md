Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-12062:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control within the `nacharity_elementor_template` shortcode in the Charity Addon for Elementor plugin. This shortcode allows users to embed Elementor templates, but it doesn't properly check user permissions when retrieving the content for display.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authorization Bypass:** The primary weakness is that the plugin does not verify if the user has permission to view the Elementor template being requested through the `nacharity_elementor_template` shortcode. This allows users with minimal permissions, such as Contributor-level, to access and extract content from private or draft posts meant to be restricted.
*   **Information Exposure:** This bypass leads to the exposure of sensitive data within private or draft Elementor posts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Leakage:** Attackers can gain access to the content of private and draft posts created with Elementor, which may include confidential information, unpublished content, or other sensitive data. This is considered an information exposure vulnerability.
*   **Privacy Violation:**  Unauthorized access to private content violates the privacy of users and content creators.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Exploitation:** The attack vector is the `nacharity_elementor_template` shortcode. An attacker crafts the shortcode, providing the ID of a restricted post as the `id` attribute, thereby bypassing access controls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have at least a Contributor-level account on the affected WordPress site.
*   **Shortcode Usage:** The attacker needs the ability to use shortcodes within the WordPress environment.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of the plugin up to and including version 1.3.2.
*   There is no known patch available for this vulnerability. The recommendation is to review the vulnerability details and implement mitigations or uninstall the affected software.
*   The Wordfence article provides a CVSS score of 4.3 (Medium) and a CVSS vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N.

In summary, CVE-2024-12062 represents a vulnerability where authenticated users with contributor access (or higher) can extract the contents of private or draft posts created with Elementor by exploiting the `nacharity_elementor_template` shortcode due to a lack of proper permission checks.
