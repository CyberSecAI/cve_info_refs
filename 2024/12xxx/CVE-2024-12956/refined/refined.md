Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12956

**Vulnerability:** Unrestricted File Upload

**Root Cause:**
* The `/add_achievement_details.php` file in the "Portfolio Management System MCA Project using PHP and MySQL" project allows arbitrary file uploads without proper restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application does not validate or sanitize the uploaded file's type, name, or content. This allows an attacker to upload any file, including executable scripts.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any special permissions, meaning an attacker does not need to be logged in or have any specific role within the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers can upload and execute malicious scripts on the server, leading to full server compromise.
*   **System Control:** Successful exploitation could allow attackers to gain control of the server, manipulate data, and potentially disrupt the application's functionality or business operations.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers could potentially steal sensitive data stored on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted POST request to `/add_achievement_details.php` with a malicious file included in the multipart/form-data.
*   **File Upload Field:** The `ach_certy` field is used to upload the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
* No prior authentication or special permissions are required to exploit this vulnerability

**Technical Details**
*   The provided proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrates uploading a PHP file (`shell.php`) containing `<?php phpinfo();?>`. Once uploaded, accessing this file would execute the PHP code on the server.
* The vulnerability exists because the application does not properly validate and sanitize the uploaded file data.

**Suggested Fixes:**
*   **Separate Storage:** Store uploaded files outside the web server's document root to prevent direct access and execution.
*   **Rename Files:** Modify the names of uploaded files and their extensions to prevent execution (e.g., by adding a random hash and changing extensions).
*   **Backend File Validation:** Implement server-side checks on file type, size, and content using MIME type validation or a library like `fileinfo` to avoid client side manipulations.
*   **Path Separation:** Separate file upload paths based on services, and use generated filenames for download, adding an extra layer of security.
