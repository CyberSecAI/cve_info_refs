## Open Redirect Vulnerability on Admin Verification Page in ruifang-tech Rebuild 3.8.6

### Description:

An open redirect vulnerability exists in the Rebuild 3.8.6 application at the `/user/admin-verify?nexturl=%2Fadmin%2Fsystems` endpoint. The `nexturl` parameter accepts unvalidated input, allowing attackers to redirect users to arbitrary attacker-controlled URLs. This vulnerability can be exploited by tricking any admin user into authenticating, after which they are redirected to a malicious page.

Exploitation of this vulnerability could facilitate phishing attacks, credential theft, or other malicious activities by leveraging the trust users place in the legitimate application.

### Affected Component:

* Endpoint: `/user/admin-verify?nexturl=%2Fadmin%2Fsystems`
* Application Version: Rebuild 3.8.6-release

### Type of Vulnerability:

[CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html)

### Impact:

* Phishing Attacks:
  An attacker can craft URLs that appear legitimate but redirect users to malicious sites to steal credentials or sensitive information.
* Exploitation Chain:
  Combined with social engineering or other vulnerabilities, attackers can escalate attacks.

### Steps to Reproduce / PoC:

1. Set Up:

   * On a local setup of Rebuild 3.8.6, navigate to `http://localhost:18080/dashboard/home`
   * On the top right hand corner, click on the gear icon to navigate to `http://localhost:18080/user/admin-verify?nexturl=%2Fadmin%2Fsystems`
2. Attack:

   * Observe the `nexturl` parameter can be tampered.
   * Host a malicious page (evil.html) locally or on a remote server. As a PoC, we can host it locally (`http://localhost/evil.html`) This page can contain phishing content or other malicious scripts.
   * Modify `nexturl=` to load any arbitrary attacker controlled webpage such as `http://localhost/evil.html`
   ```
    http://localhost:18080/user/admin-verify?nexturl=http://localhost/evil.html

   ```
   * Observe the redirection to evil.html webpage after an admin user inputs valid credentials.

### Root Cause:

Rebuild 3.8.6 contains inadequate validation and sanitization of the `nexturl` parameter within the `/user/admin-verify?nexturl=%2Fadmin%2Fsystems` endpoint. This allows attackers to supply arbitrary URLs as an argument to `nexturl` and send the crafted URL to admins, resulting in an open redirect vulnerability.

### Mitigation Recommendations:

1. **Parameter Validation:**

   * Validate the `nexturl` parameter to ensure it only contains whitelisted URLs that belong to the application's domain.
   * Reject or sanitize any input containing external or invalid URLs.
2. **Hardcoded Redirects:**

   * Use hardcoded redirect paths for known endpoints instead of accepting arbitrary user input in redirection logic.
