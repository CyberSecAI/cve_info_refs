- **Root cause:** Inadequate validation and sanitization of the `nexturl` parameter within the `/user/admin-verify` endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Open redirect vulnerability (CWE-601) due to the lack of validation of the `nexturl` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Phishing attacks: Attackers can redirect users to malicious sites to steal credentials or sensitive information by crafting malicious URLs.
    - Exploitation Chain: Can be combined with other vulnerabilities and social engineering attacks to escalate the attack.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Crafted URL with a malicious URL in the `nexturl` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick an admin into clicking it.
