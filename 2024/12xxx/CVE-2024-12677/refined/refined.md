Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12677

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the deserialization of untrusted data within Delta Electronics' DTM Soft software. The software processes serialized objects without proper validation, allowing malicious input to be processed, which can lead to code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The software deserializes objects without adequate validation, enabling an attacker to inject malicious serialized data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system running the vulnerable software. This means the attacker could gain control of the system, potentially leading to data breaches, denial of service, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, implying the attacker needs some level of access to the system where DTM Soft is installed.
- **User Interaction:**  The user needs to be tricked into opening a malicious file or be influenced into a malicious action for the exploit to succeed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local access:** An attacker would need to have local access to a system with the affected software installed.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker would need to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file or interacting with the application in a malicious way, leading to the deserialization of untrusted data.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in DTM Soft versions 1.30 and prior.
- A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 ([AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)) and a CVSS v4 base score of 8.5 ([CVSS4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N)) have been calculated for this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.
- The recommended mitigation is to update DTM Soft to version 1.60.
