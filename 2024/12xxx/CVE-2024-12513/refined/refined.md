Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the `RF_CONTEST` shortcode of the "Contests by Rewards Fuel" WordPress plugin. This means that user-supplied attributes to the shortcode are not properly cleaned before being included in the generated web page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious scripts injected through the shortcode are stored in the database and executed each time a user visits the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they view a page containing the vulnerable shortcode.
*   **Malicious Actions:** This can lead to a variety of malicious actions, such as:
    *   Redirecting users to phishing websites.
    *   Stealing user session cookies.
    *   Modifying the content of the web page.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    *  Defacing the website

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Injection:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript code through the 'contest' attribute of the `RF_CONTEST` shortcode. This can be achieved by users with Contributor access or higher who can post/edit content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** An attacker must have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress website to be able to create or modify content and inject the malicious shortcode with a crafted `contest` attribute.
*  **Knowledge of the vulnerable shortcode:** The attacker needs to know which shortcode is vulnerable and how to inject the malicious payload using the "contest" attribute.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions of the "Contests by Rewards Fuel" plugin up to and including 2.0.65.
*   The fix was implemented in version 2.0.66 by sanitizing the 'contest' attribute using `sanitize_text_field()` and escaping output using `esc_url()` and `esc_attr()`. This prevents the injection of malicious code by cleaning up the user-supplied input.
