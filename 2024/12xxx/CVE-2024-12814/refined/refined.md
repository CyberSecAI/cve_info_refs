Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12814

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the 'loancomparison' shortcode of the Loan Comparison WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied attributes within the 'loancomparison' shortcode, allowing the injection of arbitrary web scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject malicious scripts into pages that utilize the vulnerable shortcode. When a user visits a page containing the injected script, the script will execute in their browser. This could lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Data theft
  - Defacement of the website
  - Redirection to malicious websites
  - Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the 'loancomparison' shortcode.
- Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code through shortcode attributes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated access:** The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This allows them to create or edit posts and pages and use shortcodes.
- **Knowledge of shortcode:** The attacker needs to be aware of the `loancomparison` shortcode and how to manipulate its attributes to inject malicious code.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Loan Comparison plugin up to and including version 2.0.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.0.1 by adding input sanitization using `esc_attr` and `sanitize_text_field` to the shortcode attributes.
- The provided content includes the patch details and the code changes to remediate the vulnerability. Specifically, the code changes within `loancomparison.php` show where `esc_attr` and `sanitize_text_field` were added to sanitize the shortcode attributes before they are used.
