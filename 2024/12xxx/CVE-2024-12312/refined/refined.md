Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-12312:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure deserialization of data within the `designer-saved-projects` cookie. The Print Science Designer plugin uses `unserialize()` on the cookie data without proper validation or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **PHP Object Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the potential for PHP Object Injection through the deserialization of untrusted data from the `designer-saved-projects` cookie.
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The use of `unserialize()` on user-controlled data without validation.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If a suitable POP (Property Oriented Programming) chain exists within the WordPress installation (either in the plugin itself, other installed plugins, or the theme), an attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution on the server.
- **Sensitive Data Retrieval:** The attacker may be able to retrieve sensitive data from the server if the POP chain allows it.
- **File Deletion:** An attacker might be able to delete arbitrary files on the server if the POP chain allows it.
- **Other Malicious Actions:** Other actions depending on the available POP chain within the environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious payload that is serialized, and sets it as the value of the `designer-saved-projects` cookie.
- When the vulnerable code executes, the `unserialize()` function deserializes the malicious payload, leading to the injection of a PHP object.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- They need the ability to send HTTP requests to the target server.
- Knowledge of creating serialized PHP objects is required.
- If the attacker wants to achieve remote code execution, the presence of a suitable POP chain in the target environment is a must.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided code snippets show the vulnerable code in `saved-projects.php` (specifically line 120 in versions <= 1.3.152, and line 114 for version 1.3.153).
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.3.153 by switching from `serialize` and `unserialize` to `json_encode` and `json_decode`, which don't allow object injection.
- The Wordfence article emphasizes that the vulnerable plugin itself does not have a known POP chain. The exploitability depends on other components of the target WordPress system.
