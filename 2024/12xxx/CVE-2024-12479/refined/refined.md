Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or parameterization of user-supplied input within the `TopicDao.java` file of the `wetech-cms` project. Specifically, the `keyword` parameter in the `/keyword/{id}` route is directly incorporated into an SQL query without adequate escaping or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the direct inclusion of user-controlled data into an SQL query, which enables an attacker to manipulate the query's structure and logic.
*  **Lack of Input Validation:** The system fails to validate or sanitize the input received for the keyword parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive database information, including database names, table names, and stored data. As shown in the example, the attacker was able to extract the database name.
*   **Potential for Data Modification or Deletion:** Depending on the database user privileges, an attacker could potentially modify or delete data. This is not demonstrated in the provided content, but is a typical risk of SQL injection.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted GET request to the `/keyword/{id}` endpoint.
*   **Malicious Input:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `keyword` parameter of the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the target application to send HTTP requests.
*   **Understanding of SQL Syntax:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft the injection payloads.
*   **Knowledge of the Application's API:** Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and its parameter is required.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is demonstrated through a crafted SQL payload injected into the `keyword` parameter.
*   The provided python script automates the extraction of database name using blind SQL injection techniques by measuring the response lengths.
*   The vulnerable code resides in `wetech-cms-master\wetech-core\src\main\java\tech\wetech\cms\dao\TopicDao.java`

In summary, the provided content demonstrates a classic SQL injection vulnerability in `wetech-cms` due to unsanitized user input in SQL queries. It provides details on the attack vector, payload construction, and a python script to automate exploitation and data extraction.
