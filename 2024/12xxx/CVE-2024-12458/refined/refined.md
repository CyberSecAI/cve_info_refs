Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12458

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when handling user-supplied attributes within the 'spb-button' shortcode of the Smart PopUp Blaster WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input, allowing malicious scripts to be stored in the database. These scripts are then executed when a user accesses a page containing the injected shortcode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
*   When a user visits a page containing the malicious script, the script will execute within the user's browser.
*   This can lead to various malicious actions, including:
    *   Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacing the website.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the 'spb-button' shortcode of the Smart PopUp Blaster plugin.
*   Attackers can inject malicious scripts through the attributes of this shortcode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with at least "contributor" level access. This means they can create and edit content, including using shortcodes.
*   **Knowledge of Shortcode Usage:** The attacker needs to know how to use the vulnerable 'spb-button' shortcode and its attributes to inject malicious code.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.4.3.
*   No patch is currently available.
* The plugin has been closed as of December 5, 2024 and is not available for download
