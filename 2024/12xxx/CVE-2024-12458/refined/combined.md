### Description

The Smart PopUp Blaster plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'spb-button' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

### [Great Plugin with 2 Issues](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/great-plugin-with-2-issues/)

First of all: Great plugin, seriously good job.
I tried other plugins and they are not as customisable as this one, as I am using it for popping up a login/registration form.
However I see 2 issues:
– The plugin enables a popup either on all pages or on specific page-categories you can choose (e.g. page/post/404 …). What it should do is let me enable it on specific pages by slug or page id. The reason is the following:
I am using it to display a login and reg. form, and I have 2 different ones for each, so 4 in total. Now my membership plugin complains (s2member), because it can see 2 reg. forms on those pages (1 of them is in the body placed by this plugin, the other one is the actual popup.) This caused me some headache, as dequeing and deregistering it doesn’t work.
– This plugin seems to use admin-ajax to deliver its CSS. This causes an extra 800ms of loading time for my page. Maybe this could be solved in a different way.
