Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the `wb_share_social` shortcode of the MagicPost WordPress plugin. Specifically, user-supplied attributes within the shortcode are not properly handled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. This occurs because unsanitized user input is stored in the database and later rendered on a web page without proper escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page that uses the vulnerable shortcode.
*   **Execution of Malicious Scripts:** When a user visits the page containing the injected script, the attacker's code will execute within the user's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    *   Redirecting users to phishing websites.
    *   Stealing session cookies or other sensitive information.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user, such as changing settings or posting content.
    *   Defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Injection:** The attack vector involves using the vulnerable `wb_share_social` shortcode with crafted attributes containing malicious JavaScript code. This shortcode can be inserted into posts, pages, or other areas where shortcodes are processed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Contributor+ Access:** The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This means they need to be logged in with an account that has the ability to create or modify content.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the MagicPost plugin up to and including 1.2.1.
*   The vulnerability has been patched in version 1.2.2 by implementing proper sanitization using `esc_attr()` on the `wpclass` attribute and the `name` value of share items.
*   The provided changelog in the Trac data confirms the fix of "xss security issues with share shortcode".
