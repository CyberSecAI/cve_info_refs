- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists in the parsing of STP files due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, leading to a type confusion condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Type confusion vulnerability, improper validation of user-supplied data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process on affected installations of Delta Electronics DRASimuCAD.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious STP file which the user must open or interact with a malicious page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious STP file. User interaction is required, either by opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious webpage.
