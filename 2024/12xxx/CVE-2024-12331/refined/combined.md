### Description

The File Manager Pro – Filester plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'ajax\_install\_plugin' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.6. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to install the Filebird plugin.
