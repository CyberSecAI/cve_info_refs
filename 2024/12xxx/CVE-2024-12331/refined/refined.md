Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12331

**Vulnerability Description:** The File Manager Pro â€“ Filester plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized data modification due to a missing capability check in the 'ajax_install_plugin' function. This allows authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access and above to install the Filebird plugin.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `ajax_install_plugin` function. Specifically, it fails to verify if the current user has the necessary permissions (specifically `install_plugins` and `activate_plugins`) before proceeding to install the Filebird plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Missing Authorization Check:** The core issue is the lack of proper authorization verification before performing plugin installation.
*   **Inadequate Privilege Checks:** The plugin doesn't check if the user initiating the action has the required `install_plugins` and `activate_plugins` capabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Plugin Installation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker with at least subscriber level privileges to install the Filebird plugin. This could lead to further exploitation, potentially allowing the attacker to gain more control over the site depending on the installed plugin.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is accessed through the network (AV:N).
*   **Low Attack Complexity:** The attack complexity is low (AC:L).
*   **Authenticated Access:** Attackers require authenticated access (PR:L) as a user with at least subscriber level privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required (UI:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have an account with at least Subscriber-level access to the WordPress site.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send AJAX requests to the vulnerable plugin endpoint.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The Wordfence article provides more specific details on the vulnerability and identifies the vulnerable function.
*   The provided information also includes details of the fix (version 1.8.7) where the proper capability check was added.
*   The fix includes adding `current_user_can('install_plugins')` and `current_user_can('activate_plugins')` to verify if the user has the sufficient permissions before proceeding with the installation.
