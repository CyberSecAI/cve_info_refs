- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation and sanitization of user-supplied parameters. The application directly concatenates these parameters into the HTML output without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the `tag.php`, `user.php`, `plugin.php`, and `store.php` files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into web pages. If an administrator accesses the crafted malicious URL, the attacker may be able to obtain the administrator's session cookies.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attack vector is through crafted URLs containing malicious JavaScript payloads via the `keyword` and `filter` parameters within the vulnerable files (`tag.php`, `user.php`, `plugin.php`, and `store.php`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and deliver malicious URLs to the target user (administrator in the given context).
