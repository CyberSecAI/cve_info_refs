Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-12183:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the `RemoveXSS` function in the `/plus/carbuyaction.php` file of DedeCMS 5.7.116. This function, intended to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, fails to adequately filter malicious payloads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS:** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, where malicious JavaScript code is injected into the system and stored. The code is then executed when a user views the affected data.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The `RemoveXSS` function fails to filter out a specific XSS payload, allowing the malicious script to be saved and executed later.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing of sensitive information (e.g., cookies)
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP POST request to the `/plus/carbuyaction.php` endpoint.
- **Malicious Comments during Purchase:** The attacker injects the malicious payload within the comment section of the car buying process, which is then stored by the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, requiring network access to the target system.
- **Basic User Privileges:**  The attacker needs to be able to perform the action of purchasing a product, which is typical of an end user, not specifically an admin.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to know the specific parameters that are vulnerable (`des`, `postname`, `email`, `address`).

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code is within `/plus/carbuyaction.php`, specifically the `RemoveXSS` function.
- The attacker bypasses the `RemoveXSS` function using a payload such as `<body onpointermove="alert(document.cookie)">`.
- The vulnerability is triggered when an administrator views the order details, which then renders the stored XSS payload, executing the malicious script.
- It is noted that external JavaScript can also be loaded by modifying the payload.

**CVSS Metrics:**
- **Severity:** Moderate (5.3)
- **Attack Vector:** Network
- **Attack Complexity:** Low
- **Privileges Required:** Low
- **User Interaction:** None
- **Confidentiality Impact:** None
- **Integrity Impact:** Low
- **Availability Impact:** None

This is a standard stored XSS vulnerability, where the attacker stores malicious javascript in the comments. When the user views the comment, the XSS is executed. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely and doesn't require special privileges. The exploit details show how to use the vulnerable `des`, `postname`, `email`, and `address` parameters within the POST request.
