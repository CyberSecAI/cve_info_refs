Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12066

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient file path validation within the `smsa_delete_label()` function of the SMSA Shipping(official) WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The plugin allows deletion of arbitrary files on the server due to the lack of proper validation of the file path provided to the `wp_delete_file` function.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin sanitizes the file name using `sanitize_file_name()`, but it doesn't validate if the path is within the intended directory or prevent path traversal.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to delete any file accessible by the web server.
- **Remote Code Execution:** Deleting critical files, such as `wp-config.php`, can lead to complete compromise of the WordPress site, potentially leading to remote code execution and full control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is carried out over the network.
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is accessed through the WordPress admin interface via the AJAX action `wp_ajax_delete_label`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated as a WordPress user with at least "Subscriber" level access.
- **Access to WordPress admin interface:** The attacker must be able to access the WordPress admin dashboard.

**Technical Details:**
- The `smsa_delete_label()` function (lines 250-258 in `smsa-express-shipping.php`) takes the `attach_path` parameter from the POST request and directly uses it in the `wp_delete_file()` function after only sanitizing the filename. The code does not validate if the provided path is within the intended directory.
- The `attach_path` parameter is extracted from the `$_POST` array and sanitized using `sanitize_file_name()`. This function sanitizes the filename, but does not protect against directory traversal attacks.
- `wp_delete_file()` function is used to delete the file specified by `$attach_path`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided code includes other functions related to printing and generating labels, handling order status, and other features of the plugin, which are not directly related to the reported file deletion vulnerability.
- The `smsa_delete_label()` function is vulnerable because it uses user-provided input to specify a file path to be deleted, without proper validation.
- The fix would involve a robust validation to ensure the provided path is only within a predefined upload directory, preventing attackers from deleting arbitrary files.
