Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the `states_map` shortcode of the "States Map US" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied attributes within the `states_map` shortcode. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code, which is then stored in the database and executed when a user views a page containing the vulnerable shortcode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they access a page containing the malicious shortcode. This can be used to:
    - Steal cookies and session tokens, leading to account compromise.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Deface the website.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user.
    - Inject further malicious content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `states_map` shortcode. An attacker can insert malicious JavaScript code within the shortcode's attributes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with at least "Contributor" level access or higher. This role grants the ability to create or modify content, including embedding shortcodes.
- **Knowledge of Shortcode Usage:** The attacker needs knowledge of how to use the `states_map` shortcode and its attributes to inject the malicious code.
