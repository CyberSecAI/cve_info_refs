I really love this plugin. It’s simple to use and meets my needs perfectly. The support from Niaz was even better. I am not that WP proficient so I needed some help. Niaz was great. Feel really good about my purchase. Thanks.

Obviously this is just a working trial version as just PayPal can be used for payments. I had also expected prepayment.

Магазин хороший, но нет русской валюты – из-за этого пользоваться этим плагином невозможно, так как “пей пал” в русском аккаунте принимает только русскую валюту.

### Description

The Simple Ecommerce Shopping Cart Plugin- Sell products through Paypal plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘monthly\_sales\_current\_year’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
