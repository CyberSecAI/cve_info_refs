Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `page` parameter within the WP Service Payment Form With Authorize.net plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts. If a user clicks a malicious link created by the attacker, the script will execute in the user's browser within the context of the vulnerable website. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    *   Defacement of the website.
    *   Theft of sensitive information.
    *   Other malicious actions performed in the context of the victim's session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a URL containing malicious JavaScript in the `page` parameter of the vulnerable plugin page.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker tricks a user into clicking on the specially crafted link, for example, by sending a link via email or posting it on social media.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated attacker:** The attacker does not need to have an account on the WordPress site.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable plugin:** The attacker needs to know the plugin is being used, the vulnerable parameter (`page`) and how to craft a malicious URL using this parameter.
*   **Ability to lure a user:** The attacker must be able to trick a user into clicking the crafted malicious link.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of the plugin up to and including 2.6.3.
*   There is no known patch available for this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerable code is located in `wpspf-payments-list.php` file
*   The vulnerable line of code in `wpspf-payments-list.php` is Line 320: `<input type="hidden" name="page" value="<?php  echo  $_REQUEST['page']  ?>" />` which directly uses user input without sanitization.
