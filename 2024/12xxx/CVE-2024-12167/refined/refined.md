Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12167

**Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `_wpnonce` parameter within the Shortcodes Blocks Creator Ultimate plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected XSS: The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `_wpnonce` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are reflected back to the user.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The plugin does not adequately clean or validate the `_wpnonce` parameter before using it in the application.
- Lack of Output Escaping: The plugin does not escape special characters in the `_wpnonce` parameter when outputting it on the page, which can lead to the browser interpreting malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- If a user clicks on a crafted link containing the malicious script, the script will execute in the user's browser, potentially leading to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Data theft
  - Redirection to malicious websites
  - Other malicious actions

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can craft a malicious URL with a payload in the `_wpnonce` parameter.
- The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking this malicious link to execute the injected script in their browser.
- The attack is reflected because the injected script will be rendered as part of the response.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any authentication or access to the WordPress dashboard.
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a URL and trick a user to visit that URL.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Shortcodes Blocks Creator Ultimate plugin up to and including 2.2.0.
- There is no patch currently available for this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered by researcher vgo0.
- The vulnerable code is located at line 111 in `admin/class-admin.php`
- The Wordfence article suggests that the best course of action might be to uninstall the plugin.
