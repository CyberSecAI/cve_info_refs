The provided content relates to CVE-2024-12941.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient user input verification for the "id" parameter in the `deletedannounce.php` file. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability in `deletedannounce.php`.
- Lack of proper sanitization/validation of user-supplied input (`id` parameter).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized database access.
- Sensitive data leakage.
- Data tampering.
- Comprehensive system control.
- Service interruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request to `deletedannounce.php` with a malicious `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is explicitly required in the provided information

**Technical Details:**
The attacker injects malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter in the `deletedannounce.php` file, which is then used directly in a SQL query without proper sanitization.  The vulnerability is both time-based blind and boolean-based blind.  The attacker can potentially use tools like sqlmap to automate the exploitation process and extract database information.

**Vulnerable File:**
- `deletedannounce.php`

**Vulnerable Parameter:**
- `id` (GET parameter)

**Payload examples:**
- Boolean-based blind: `id=(SELECT (CASE WHEN (3956=3956) THEN 1 ELSE (SELECT 2576 UNION SELECT 5262) END))`
- Time-based blind: `id=1 AND 3308=(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS A, INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS B, INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS C WHERE 0 XOR 1)`
