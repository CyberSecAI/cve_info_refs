| CVSS | 6.4 (Medium) |
| Publicly Published | December 12, 2024 |

| Researcher | [Peter Thaleikis](https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/researchers/spek) |

### Description

The Property Hive Stamp Duty Calculator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'stamp\_duty\_calculator\_scotland' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.22 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
