Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12465

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the 'stamp\_duty\_calculator\_scotland' shortcode of the Property Hive Stamp Duty Calculator plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input, allowing attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code into the website.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Web Script Execution:** Successful exploitation enables attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute whenever a user accesses a page containing the injected shortcode. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, such as:
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Stealing cookies or session tokens.
    *   Modifying website content.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Shortcode Injection:** Attackers inject malicious code through the plugin's shortcode attribute values, specifically within the `stamp_duty_calculator_scotland` shortcode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Contributor+ Access:** Attackers need to be authenticated users with at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site to be able to create or edit posts/pages and insert the malicious shortcode.

**Additional Details:**
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions of the Property Hive Stamp Duty Calculator plugin up to and including 1.0.22 are vulnerable.
*   **Patched Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.0.23.
*   **Specific vulnerable parameters:** The `price` attribute in the shortcode was not properly sanitized in multiple template files (`stamp-duty-calculator-commercial.php`, `stamp-duty-calculator-scotland.php`, `stamp-duty-calculator-wales.php`, `stamp-duty-calculator.php`). The fix was to use `esc_attr()` to escape the attribute.
