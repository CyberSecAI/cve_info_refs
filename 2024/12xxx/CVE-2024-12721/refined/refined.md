Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12721

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the deserialization of untrusted input within the `wb_custom_tabs` parameter. The plugin does not properly sanitize data before it is deserialized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **PHP Object Injection:** The plugin is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection via the deserialization of the `wb_custom_tabs` parameter. This means that an attacker can inject malicious PHP objects into the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Deletion, Sensitive Data Retrieval, or Code Execution:** While the vulnerable software itself doesn't contain a known POP chain, if one exists in another installed plugin or theme on the target system, exploitation could lead to arbitrary file deletion, sensitive data retrieval or remote code execution. This would be a serious security risk for the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited over the network.
- **`wb_custom_tabs` Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted serialized PHP object via the `wb_custom_tabs` parameter when submitting product data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated (Shop Manager+)**: Attackers need to be authenticated with Shop Manager-level access or higher to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the "Custom Product Tabs For WooCommerce" plugin up to and including 1.2.4.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.5.
- The fix is mentioned in the provided code file as "*[Fix] Security vulnerability fixed.*"
- The Wordfence article mentions Francesco Carlucci as the researcher who discovered the vulnerability.
- The provided Trac link to the code shows the `get_product_tabs()` function which retrieves the meta data that is vulnerable.

In summary, this CVE highlights a serious vulnerability related to insecure deserialization. If a POP chain is present, exploitation can allow an authenticated user with specific access to perform various malicious operations including achieving remote code execution.
