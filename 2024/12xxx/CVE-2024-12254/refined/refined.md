{
  "CVE-2024-12254": {
    "description": "Starting in Python 3.12.0, the asyncio._SelectorSocketTransport.writelines() method would not \"pause\" writing and signal to the Protocol to drain the buffer to the wire once the write buffer reached the \"high-water mark\". Because of this, Protocols would not periodically drain the write buffer potentially leading to memory exhaustion.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `_SelectorSocketTransport.writelines()` method in Python's asyncio library failed to implement flow control, specifically by not pausing writes when the buffer reached the high-water mark. This oversight prevented the protocol from being signaled to drain the buffer, which could lead to uncontrolled memory growth.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper Input Validation",
        "Unbounded memory allocation"
      ],
      "impact": "A malicious actor or a poorly designed application can cause a memory exhaustion on the host by sending large amounts of data via `writelines()` without waiting for the buffer to drain. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.",
      "attack_vectors": "Network-based attacks where an attacker can send data to a vulnerable application using the `writelines()` method.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to establish a network connection with the vulnerable application and send data. There are no specific attacker privileges required for exploiting the vulnerability."
    },
     "affected_versions": "Python 3.12.0 and later, on macOS or Linux, using the asyncio module with protocols, and using the .writelines() method which had new zero-copy-on-write behavior in Python 3.12.0 and later.",
     "fixes": "The vulnerability was addressed by ensuring that `_SelectorSocketTransport.writelines` pauses the protocol if it reaches the high water mark as needed. Patches are available in Python 3.12.x, 3.13.x and the main branch. "
