The Web3 Crypto Payments by DePay for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the /wp-json/depay/wc/debug REST API endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 2.12.17. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve debug infromation.
