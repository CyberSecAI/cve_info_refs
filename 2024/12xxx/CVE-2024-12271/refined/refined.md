{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'ref' parameter within the 360 Javascript Viewer plugin.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Authenticated attackers with administrator-level access can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will then execute whenever a user accesses the affected page, leading to potential compromise of user sessions, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is through the plugin's shortcode functionality, where the 'ref' parameter is not properly sanitized before being used to generate HTML output.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrator-level privileges within the WordPress instance to inject the malicious shortcode.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled, indicating that the vulnerability is triggered in scenarios where WordPress's default HTML sanitization is not in place or bypassed."
