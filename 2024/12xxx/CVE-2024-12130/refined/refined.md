Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-12130:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an "out of bounds read" condition within the affected software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The software improperly handles memory access, allowing a read operation to occur beyond the allocated boundaries of memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the target system.
* A threat actor could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered by a specially crafted DOE file.
*   A legitimate user must execute the malicious DOE file crafted by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious DOE file.
*   The attacker relies on a legitimate user to open/execute the malicious file.

**Summary:**

CVE-2024-12130 is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in Rockwell Automation's Arena software. By crafting a malicious DOE file, an attacker can force the software to read beyond the allocated memory boundaries. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if a legitimate user opens the malicious file.
