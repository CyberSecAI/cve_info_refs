Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `admin/edit-customer-detailed.php` file of the "Beauty Parlour Management System PHP SQLite Project".
- The vulnerability arises from insufficient user input validation of the `name` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input (`name` parameter) before using it in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database.
- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data.
- **Comprehensive System Control:** Attackers may gain comprehensive control over the system.
- **Service Interruption:** Attackers may cause service disruptions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exposed through the `admin/edit-customer-detailed.php` file via HTTP POST request.
- The attack vector is the `name` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any prior login or authorization to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable script.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited with boolean-based blind SQL injection and time-based blind SQL injection techniques.
- The provided payloads demonstrate how to achieve this using the `name` parameter.
- The attacker can use tools like sqlmap to automate the exploitation process.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content includes a detailed description of the vulnerability and provides example payloads and sqlmap commands for exploitation.
- It also suggests repair strategies like using prepared statements and parameter binding, input validation, minimizing database user permissions, and regular security audits.
