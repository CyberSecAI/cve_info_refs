The Affiliate Program Suite â€” SliceWP Affiliates plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.23. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
