Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `tf_enquiry_reply_email_callback` function of the Tourfic WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `enquiry_id` parameter, which is user-supplied, is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query. The SQL query also lacks sufficient preparation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  The lack of input sanitization and prepared statements makes the plugin vulnerable to SQL injection. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code via the `enquiry_id` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Data Extraction:** An attacker can leverage the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database. This could include user data, plugin settings, or other sensitive details.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
*   **HTTP Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint (`wp_ajax_tf_enquiry_reply_email`).
*  **Parameter Manipulation:** The attack vector utilizes the `enquiry_id` parameter within the request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with at least "Subscriber" level access (or higher).
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress site.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in all versions of the Tourfic plugin up to and including 2.15.3.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.15.4.
*   The Wordfence article provides a CVSS score of 6.5 (Medium)
