Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The application lacks proper access controls on the `/users/id` endpoint, allowing unauthenticated users to access user information using arbitrary IDs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR): The application uses predictable user IDs directly in the URL, enabling attackers to access different user accounts by manipulating these IDs.
- Authorization Bypass: There is no check to verify if the requesting user has the necessary permissions to access the user information being requested.
- Information Disclosure: The server returns specific error messages ("User not found. ID: your supplied ID") which allow an attacker to differentiate between valid and invalid user IDs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- User enumeration: Attackers can systematically discover valid usernames by trying different IDs and observing the server responses.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Direct request to the `/users/id` endpoint with manipulated user IDs via HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability and only needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the server.
