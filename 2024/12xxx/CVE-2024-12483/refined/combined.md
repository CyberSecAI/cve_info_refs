## CVE-2024-12483 - Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in Dromara UJCMS 9.6.3 Allows Username Enumeration via User ID manipulation

### Description:

An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was discovered in UJCMS version 9.6.3 that allows unauthenticated enumeration of usernames through the manipulation of the user id parameter in the /users/id endpoint. While the user IDs are generally large numbers (e.g., 69278363520885761), with the exception of the admin and anonymous account, unauthenticated attackers can still systematically discover usernames of existing accounts.

### Affected Component:

* Endpoint: `/users/id`
* Application Version: 9.6.3

### Type of Vulnerability:

CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key

### Impact:

User enumeration

### Steps to Reproduce / PoC:

* Access the application as an unauthenticated user.
* For local testing, visit <http://localhost:8080/users/id>, replacing id with any arbitrary integer.
* If a user id is invalid, the response will contain "User not found. ID: your supplied ID"
* Repeat the process with different id values to enumerate valid usernames.

### Root Cause:

The application fails to implement proper access controls on the /users/id endpoint. This allows any unauthenticated users to enumerate usernames associated with arbitrary id values.

### Mitigation Recommendations:

* Authorization Checks: Validate that the requesting user is authorized to access the page associated with the provided id.
* Randomized Identifiers: Replace numeric user IDs with opaque, non-predictable identifiers such as UUIDs.
* Generic Error Responses: Avoid exposing usernames in responses. Return generic error messages like 403 Forbidden or 404 Not Found for unauthorized requests.
* Rate Limiting: Implement rate-limiting mechanisms to reduce the risk of automated enumeration attacks.
