## 1.0 Whatâs New?

Privileged Access Manager 4.5 provides the following features and enhancements:

* [Product Rename Update](#t4orfynhvyk4)
* [Capability to Discover and Onboard Privileged Accounts](#t4pip6fn5tbg)
* [Enhanced and Simplified Resource Pool Management](#t4pjmt815aiq)
* [Ability to Transfer Files](#t4ou6psex4uk)
* [Enhanced Search for Resources](#t4pb0w0kcafs)
* [Ability to Block Risk Command and Users](#t4pjmvwwkt56)
* [Enhanced PAM Driver for Identity Manager](#t4pipggngosh)

### 1.1 Product Rename Update

From this release, Privileged Account Manager has been renamed to Privileged Access Manager to align with the goals and strategy of NetIQ Identity and Access Management.

### 1.2 Capability to Discover and Onboard Privileged Accounts

Privileged Access Manager simplifies the process of detecting and identifying the list of accounts associated to a resource (Target) based on the defined rule with the Discovery and Onboard feature. The Discovery and Onboard feature fetches various details of the accounts and helps in managing the discovered accounts. Discovery of privileged accounts also enables administrators to add multiple accounts to a preferred resource. Later, an administrator can transfer and onboard the discovered accounts to Credential Vault for enabling various supported privileged access features for the onboarded accounts.

The Discovery and Onboard feature supports SSH and Windows Host resource types, for discovery of local privilege accounts on Linux or Unix and Windows respectively.

For more information, see [Discovery and Onboard of Privileged Accounts](../../npam_admin/data/t4pdtcv0w79p.html#t4pdtcv0w79p).

### 1.3 Enhanced and Simplified Resource Pool Management

* Provision to Group Resource Pools

  Resource Pool Groups has been introduced in Privileged Access Manager, which allows administrators to create logical set of similar Resource Pools. This simplifies the process of managing Access Control policy and reduces the number of assignments substantially.

  For more information, see [Resource Pool Groups](../../npam_admin/data/t4dyttmbta63.html#t4p8ltgg99jf).
* Add a Resource to Resource Pool

  The administrator is allowed add a resource to a new resource pool, to an existing resource pool, or include a specific resource pool for each resource without editing the resource. To perform these actions, using the following options on the Resources page:

  + Create a Resource Pool
  + Add to Existing Resource Pool
  + Create Individual Resource Pools

  For more information, see [Adding a Resource to Resource Pool](../../npam_admin/data/t4hg3ypd404y.html#t4pgkotb0bqo).
* Remove a Resource from Resource Pool

  The administrator can use the Remove from Resource Pool option to remove the resource from one resource pool and tag it to another resource pool.

  For more information, see [Removing a Resource from Resource Pool](../../npam_admin/data/t4hg3ypd404y.html#t4pgl8rloc6a).

### 1.4 Ability to Transfer Files

Privileged Access Manager facilitates users to exchange files between the local drive and the following web-based relay sessions:

* Remote Desktop Protocol Web Relay session
* Secure Shell Web Relay session

The administrator must enable File Transfer in the Access and Monitoring Options of Web RDP and Web SSH to allow upload and download of files.

For more information, see [Transferring a File to Secure Shell Web Relay Session](../../npam_admin/data/t4dyue5c4sp3.html#t4o4fj3see0a) and [File Transfer in the Remote Desktop Protocol Web Relay Session](../../npam_admin/data/t4dyu29vehpy.html#file_trnsf_rdp).

### 1.5 Enhanced Search for Resources

The Resource Name field has been introduced on the left pane of the Resources page to find a preferred resource among several available resources. This promotes ease of use for the administrators.

### 1.6 Ability to Block Risk Command and Users

This release introduces the following options to prevent any security breach and malicious act:

* Block Command: To prevent users from executing any command that is marked as risky with different levels such as high risk, medium risk and so on.
* Block User: To block users who executed the risky command and refrain them from initiating a new session.

For more information, see [Command Risk](../../npam_admin/data/t4l0t2n5rvut.html#t4l0t2n5rvut).

### 1.7 Enhanced PAM Driver for Identity Manager

PAM Driver has been enhanced to support the Access Control policy engine. The driver has been shipped with Identity Manager 4.9.

For more information, see [Privileged Access Manager Driver for Identity Manager](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/identity-manager-49-drivers/npum_driver/data/bktitle.html) guide.

#### Upgrade Considerations:

* After upgrading to PAM 4.5, it is required to install Discovery module in the Linux Manager. Open Install Packages and click Install Discovery module.
* Refresh the browser after an SPF upgrade as the certificate has to be re approved for successful logging. This is because the HTTPS certificate are upgraded after Framework patch package upgrade.
* On the PAM managers with taskmanager module, for password management module, the gssntlm library is no longer part of Privileged Access Manager installer file, therefore ensure that you install the gssntlmssp package when upgrading. For more information, see [Password Management](../../npam_admin/data/t4dywhxl25r9.html#t4dywhxl25r9).
* Delete and re-import the Privileged Access Manager certificates on each of the Application SSO agents because the HTTPS certificate is upgraded.
