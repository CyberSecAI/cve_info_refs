### Description

The WP Social AutoConnect plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 4.6.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

## Description

The simple concept behind WP-FB AutoConnect is to offer an easy-to-use widget that lets readers login to your blog with either their Facebook account or local WordPress credentials. Although many “Facebook Connect” plugins do exist, most of them are either overly complex and difficult to customize, or fail to provide a seamless experience for new visitors. I wrote this plugin to provide what the others didn’t:

* Full support for both WordPress and Buddypress.
* No user interaction is required – the login process is transparent to new and returning users alike.
* Existing users who connect with FB retain the same local user accounts as before (matched via e-mail).
* New visitors will be given new user accounts, which can be retained even if you remove the plugin.
* Facebook profile pictures can be used as avatars.
* No contact with the Facebook API after the login completes – so no slow pageloads.
* No 3rd party services: your site talks directly to Facebook, through an app created and owned by you.
* Won’t bloat your database with duplicate user accounts, extra fields, or unnecessary complications.
* Custom logging options can notify you whenever someone connects with Facebook.
* A powerful set of hooks and filters allow developers to easily tailor the login process to their personal needs: redirect to a custom page, fill xProfile data with information from Facebook, setup permissions based on social connections, and more.
* Fully HTML/CSS valid.

### Premium Addon

In addition to the free features listed above, I also offer a Premium addon to provide some more advanced functionality. The following is an abbreviated list of Premium features; a more complete list, along with details on each item, is available on the [plugin homepage](https://www.justin-klein.com/projects/wp-fb-autoconnect/#premium):

* Multisite Support
* Shortcode Support
* Image-based/styleable login buttons
* Cache Facebook avatars to your local server
* Allow users to manually associate/disassociate their existing accounts with Facebook
* Automatically populate BuddyPress X-Profiles with information from Facebook
* Announce Facebook logins to the BuddyPress Activity Stream
* Show an AJAX spinner to indicate login-in-progress
* Add a Facebook button to the comment form, login form, registration form, and WPMU signup form
* Customize the redirect URL for first-time visitors, returning visitors, and logged-out visitors
* Restrict autoregistration to Facebook friends, Facebook fans, explicitly invited users, everyone, or no one
* Send a customizable welcome mail to autoregistered users
* Customize the role assigned to autoregistered users
* Show/Hide/Customize the Widget’s links, checkboxes, and textfields. Show the logged-in user’s avatar in the Widget.
* Priority support
* …And more

### Donate

Countless hours have gone into developing, maintaining, & supporting this plugin. Just keeping it running requires ongoing work due to Facebook’s ever-changing API & WordPress’ frequent updates. If you find it useful, please consider supporting its continued development by purchasing the Premium addon or [making a donation](https://www.justin-klein.com/projects/wp-fb-autoconnect/#donate) of any amount.

### Privacy

This plugin uses the Facebook API to fetch data from Facebook. The data is used to automate user logins, and/or to automate the creation of new local WordPress user accounts. The data may therefore be copied & stored in the WordPress database, and can be removed by deleting any Facebook-linked user accounts. Usage of this plugin means the site administrator is consenting to [Facebook’s data policy](https://www.facebook.com/policy.php). Note that using the Facebook API requires loading some JS from Facebook, which may track visitors. This plugin does not use any 3rd party intermediary for processing logins or otherwise – all data is exchanged directly between your site & Facebook.

In addition, the Premium addon (if purchased & installed separately) may connect to the developer’s web store to check for updates & for license verification. This check does not transmit any information about your users, and is used solely to check for updates and for licensing verification.

### Support

## Installation

1. Download the latest version from [here](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-fb-autoconnect/), unzip it, and upload the extracted files to your plugins directory.
2. Login to your WordPress admin panel and activate the plugin.
3. Navigate to Settings -> WP-FB AutoConn.
4. Follow the steps shown in the admin panel to create & register your Facebook app.
5. If you’re using BuddyPress, a Facebook button will now automatically appear in its built-in login widget. Otherwise, navigate to Appearance->Widgets and add the WP-FB AutoConnect widget to your sidebar.

That’s it – users should now be able to use the widget to login to your blog with their Facebook accounts.

For more information on exactly how this plugin’s login process works and how it can be customized, see the [homepage](https://www.justin-klein.com/projects/wp-fb-autoconnect).

I love how existing members of my site can connect to their Facebook profile without any issues. Lots of features, no bugs so far! 🙂 (I am using the premium version.)

I’ve used this plugin for a few years now. I bought the paid update for extra items such as redirects, etc.
Several times I’ve needed to track down issues and make it work with other plugins and Justin has always been responsive and helpful. My last issue wound up being server related and he took time out of his vacation to help me. We don’t know each other, I’m just a person using his plugin.
It’s highly configurable, plays nice with other facebook plugins and theme my login, and I couldn’t find anything else that pulls as much info over from facebook. I give it a big recommend.

* Checked compatibility with WP 3.8.1

#### 3.1.6 (2014-01-10)

* Minor security fix
* Update the summary in the ‘plugins’ page of the WP admin panel
* Update the Premium admin panel tab with features from addon v33
* Update the ReadMe (tagline, list premium features, etc)

#### 3.1.5 (2013-12-13)

* Verified compatibility with WP 3.8

#### 3.1.4 (2013-10-30)

* Add a “more info” link to the debug option for enabling logs (in the admin panel).
* Add a “callback” param to jfb\_output\_facebook\_btn (required to support an in-progress premium feature)
* Add an admin panel warning if W3-Total-Cache is detected (with simple instructions for debugging an issue it sometimes causes)
* Add an admin panel warning if WPEngine is detected (with simple instructions for debugging an issue it sometimes causes)
* Tested on WP 3.7.1

#### 3.1.3 (2013-10-24)

* Fix PHP warnings when saving plugin options with WP\_DEBUG enabled (Thanks Christian Wach!)
* Replace “Mouseover for more” info links in the admin panel with “Click for more,” which uses a more mobile-compatible lightbox.
* Update WP compatibility number

#### 3.1.2 (2013-06-27)

* Widget uses wp\_lostpassword\_url() instead of site\_url( ‘wp-login.php’ ), so that wp-login.php can be moved/renamed.
* Remove the “cURL not found” admin panel warning; it’s no longer required (as of v3.0.0)

#### 3.1.1 (2013-06-20)

* Widget uses wp\_login\_url() instead of site\_url( ‘wp-login.php’ ), so that wp-login.php can be moved/renamed.

#### 3.1.0 (2013-05-07)

* Revisions to satisfy wp.org’s (apparently) new, stricter repo rules…:
* Instead of redirecting to \_process\_login.php, \_process\_login.php is always included and logins are handled during “init” (via a $\_POST check)
* Remove \_\_inc\_wp.php
* Remove \_autologin.php (it was extremely outdated & not necessary to the core plugin)
* Remove unused jQuery file
* Remove licensecheck
* Remove the auths (& add *option* to report usage statistics)
* Update the app setup instructions to mention Sandbox Mode (which FB now seems to be enabling by default)

#### 3.0.1 (2013-03-08)

* Update WP compatibility number
* Fix the image-based button preview in the admin panel teaser

#### 3.0.0 (2013-03-07)

* IMPORTANT: If you’re a Premium user, please view [FAQ46](https://www.justin-klein.com/projects/wp-fb-autoconnect#faq46) BEFORE installing this update.
* IMPORTANT: If you’ve implemented any custom actions that utilize the Facebook API instance provided by this plugin, you’ll need to update your code to use graph URLs instead (i.e: jfb\_api\_get(“https://graph.facebook.com/me?access\_token=”.$arg[‘access\_token’])). Further examples can be found on the plugin documentation page.
* This update completely eliminates the dependance on the old Facebook PHP API, which will speed up logins, significantly reduce memory usage, and prevent errors on localhost servers without a public URL.
* This update also adds support for Premium addon v30, which provides many new features (including the ability to use image-based / css-styleable login buttons).

#### 2.5.12 (2013-03-04)

* Display a warning for users who upload the premium addon to the wrong directory
* More descriptive error message for “Missing POST Data (access\_token)”
* Cleanups to admin panel tab switching; refreshing the panel now restores the previously-shown tab

#### 2.5.11 (2013-02-19)

* Widget login form uses site\_url (to support FORCE\_SSL\_LOGIN)
* Login callback redirects to \_process\_login.php over https if FORCE\_SSL\_LOGIN is enabled
* wp\_login was getting a bad 2nd parameter when called during an autoregistration; fixed
* Check for a premium function before choosing the avatar cache dir
* Update the eStore link in one admin panel warning

#### 2.5.10 (2013-02-08)

* Pass the facebook UID into \_process\_login.php so it can be logged. This is useful for debugging failed login attempts, as we can determine if they were triggered by a valid user (and if so, who).
* Add appID and appValid to the Support Info tab
* Update the cURL test on the Support Info tab
* More descriptive instructions for users who’ve moved wp-config

#### 2.5.9 (2013-01-15)

* Fix the login button jumping around on initialization (thanks to yet another bug introduced by Facebook)
* Compatibility fix for BP Avatar Bubble

#### 2.5.8 (2012-12-25)

* Fix compatibility with woocommerce (wp\_login action was supposed to take 2 parameters)
* Remove xmlns:fb from the header tag. It doesn’t seem to be necessary for any modern browsers, and breaks validation for HTML5. If you find it necessary, you can always re-add it with a simple filter.

#### 2.5.7 (2012-12-23)

* Fix for validating the API key/secret on servers with invalid SSL cert

#### 2.5.6 (2012-12-23)

* jQuery is not working for some users on WP3.5. I explicitly enqueue it now.
* Fix mistake with prelogin error check

#### 2.5.5 (2012-12-22)

* Fix double-counting of logins (hopefully)
* Add a keepalive event & prelogin error check

#### 2.5.4 (2012-12-20)

* Fix a minor bug with new user notifications in WP3.5
* Update WP compatibility number

#### 2.5.3 (2012-12-18)

* Fix a harmless warning that appears on BP when WP\_DEBUG is defined
* Another minor cleanup to the button-outputting code
* Add new filter

#### 2.5.2 (2012-12-10)

* Oops – very minor revision from 2.5.1 🙂

#### 2.5.1 (2012-12-10)

* Combine the two profile picture queries into one (shave ~0.3s off of login time)
* Eliminate action wpfb\_output\_button, and cleanup jfb\_output\_facebook\_btn for clarity (and in prep for a future change)

#### 2.5.0 (2012-11-29)

* I’ve eliminated the need for the Facebook PHP SDK entirely. Although it’s still included and passed to the actions/filters for backwards-compatibility, calls to the Graph API should now performed via jfb\_api\_get() and jfb\_api\_post(), using the access\_token provided. Specific changes:
* Rename jfb\_get() to jfb\_api\_get()
* Add jfb\_api\_post() for API calls requiring HTTP POST
* Facebook JSON responses are decoded to associative arrays rather than objects (to match the format of the PHP SDK)
* Rename “accessToken” to “access\_token” to better match the naming convention used by the Graph API
* Update jfb\_post\_to\_wall() to avoid using the $facebook class
* Update all queries & error checks in \_process\_login.php to avoid using the $facebook class
* Rearrange things in \_process\_login.php, putting the $facebook initialization code into a “to deprecate” block
* Get rid of the 2.3.6 ‘one-time update’ code to store the app access token in the DB

#### 2.4.1 (2012-11-27)

* Explicitly pass & check for the user access token in \_process\_login.php
* Provide the user access token to wpfb\_session\_established, wpfb\_connect, wpfb\_existing\_user, wpfb\_inserting\_user, wpfb\_inserted\_user, and wpfb\_login (so you can use it to query the Graph API in your addons)
* Cleanup jfb\_output\_facebook\_callback()
* Fix a harmless notice that may appear if you have WP\_DEBUG defined

#### 2.4.0 (2012-11-26)

* I’ve eliminated the old REST PHP library, which was only being used to validate the AppID & Secret in the admin panel; validation is now done with Graph. IMPORTANT: If you’ve been using this plugin since the old “App Key” days (over a year ago) and the AppID in your admin panel is an old alphanumeric value, you should replace it with the new numeric-only AppID shown in your App’s settings on Facebook.
* Include the AppID in login logs

#### 2.3.11 (2012-11-19)

* Add a few more things to the Support Info tab
* Update the Premium Options tab to reflect the latest addon version

#### 2.3.10 (2012-11-11)

* Fix error reporting for a rare login bug
* Use wp\_mail() instead of php mail() to send login logs (for servers with custom mail configurations)
* Include a stylesheet with some default widget styles
* Show “WP-FB AutoConn+” in the admin menu if the Premium addon is installed

#### 2.3.9 (2012-11-01)

* Improve browser detection for login logs (+ add detection for Android & iPad)
* Login logs include the full useragent string

#### 2.3.8 (2012-10-27)

* Get rid of old nonce debugging code
* Move the nonce check back to before the Facebook connection

#### 2.3.7 (2012-10-22)

* Bug fix when error-detecting the token in the admin panel

#### 2.3.6 (2012-10-21)

* When connecting with Facebook in the admin panel, cache the app token to the database (so addons/customizations can use it to access the API later)

#### 2.3.5 (2012-10-20)

* Add log messages when each action/filter is run in \_process\_login.php (for debugging add-ins)
* Move the Facebook connection to *before* the nonce check
* Add a new action ‘wpfb\_session\_established,’ so we can talk to Facebook before anything else happens

#### 2.3.4 (2012-10-16)

* Users who didn’t update to 2.3.1 when it was released may now have some malformed avatar URLs in their db (resulting in frontend ‘strpos’ error messages); this update will fix those avatars. Note: Please remember to update your plugin whenever a new version is released, as Facebook changes their API regularly and skipping updates can sometimes lead to unpredictable behavior.

#### 2.3.3 (2012/08/20)

* Fixed a problem with Curl detection caused by FB changing things without telling people

#### 2.3.2 (2012/08/16)

* Facebook has yet again broken their API, causing avatars to always fetch size 50×50 (even for the “large” size used by BuddyPress and some 3rd party themes). This update should work around FB’s bug, returning avatars to their former behavior.

#### 2.3.1 (2012/07/21)

* Fix a rare bug with avatar fetching

#### 2.3.0 (2012/02/22)

* Major performance improvement: logins should now be substantially faster on sites with large user databases.

#### 2.2.2 (2012/02/22)

* Update version compatibility number
* The ‘Failed to get the Facebook User Session’ error now refers to a specific FAQ.
* Add support for debugging memory usage and execution time (via the email logs)
* Combine Admin notices into one action
* Update the admin panel’s premium teaser to include newly-added features

#### 2.2.1 (2012/01/10)

* Add an admin panel check to warn users whose servers don’t have CURL installed
* Add an admin panel check to warn users whose servers dont have JSON installed
* Add a new tab to the admin panel with “Support Info” (to include when reporting a bug/issue)

#### 2.2.0 (2011-12-17)

* Nonce fix to resolve a conflict with Buddypress Groups, and potential validation issues with other plugins that use the default nonce name/action (thanks gbellucci!)
* Check for compatibility with WP3.3

#### 2.1.9 (2011-12-13)

* Removed an old (now unused) database option that was getting written on every pageload (thanks Aaron Frerichs!)

#### 2.1.8 (2011-11-28)

* Removed plugin sponsorship messages. See [Automattic Bullies WordPress Plugin Developers — Again](http://gregsplugins.com/lib/2011/11/26/automattic-bullies/).

#### 2.1.7 (2011-11-25)

* Fix: wpfb\_extended\_permissions filter was not being applied if neither “post to wall” nor “request email” options were checked.
* Add new BuddyPress XProfile mapping to the premium admin panel

#### 2.1.6 (2011-11-24)

* All new TABBED Admin panel!
* Better error reporting for “wp\_insert\_user failed”
* Add a note to the “Delete All Options” section of the admin panel
* Eliminate old admin panel code related to updating .htaccess rules for autologin
* Fix: Username style was defaulting to the legacy format on Buddypress
* Fix: Admin panel was not properly showing when the new username format is selected

#### 2.1.5 (2011-11-22)

* The “Buddypress-Friendly” username format (First.Last) seems to create issues with author links in WordPress, so I’ve added a new “First\_Last” option (and left the old option there for legacy support only). If you have multiple authors and are using the “First.Last” format, you may want to change your username format.

#### 2.1.4 (2011-11-16)

* Move the Wall Announcement code into a filter, so it can be removed/replaced/customized if desired
* Update WP compatibility number

#### 2.1.3 (2011-11-15)

* Fixed a bug where the plugin was incorrectly stripping some language\_attributes, causing problems for rtl languages.

#### 2.1.2 (2011-11-08)

* Eliminate the outdated xd\_receiver.htm file
* Eliminate the outdated validate\_php5.php file
* Update the instructions for creating an app (Facebook has changed things around yet again)
* Use https instead of http in channel.html to prevent insecure content warning
* Fix “wp\_insert\_user failed” bug (since 2.1.0)

#### 2.1.1 (2011-10-29)

* Fix a critical bug introduced in 2.1.0: not prompting for e-mail *could* result in false user account matches (i.e. logging someone in as someone else). Please update now!
* Replace deprecated get\_settings() with get\_option()
* Add rel=nofollow to the lostpassword link

#### 2.1.0 (2011-10-01)

#### 2.0.5 (2011-06-14)

* Remove legacy API code from \_process\_login.php
* Remove legacy code for registering email hashes (Facebook has eliminated that functionality from their API for some reason…)
* Update instapopup to work with the new API
* Fixed avatars in Settings -> Discussion when avatar fetching is enabled
* Apply sanitize\_title to the nicename (thanks Espen Espelund)
* Add sponsorship message
* General cleanups to \_process\_login.php

#### 2.0.4 (2011-06-09)

* Add a channelUrl to FB.init to resolve [known bugs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/FB.init/) with the FB api

#### 2.0.3 (2011-06-09)

* \_process\_login will now look for “rememberme” POST variable
* Added a new “wpfb\_rememberme” filter, so you can override the above if desired

#### 2.0.2 (2011-05-26)

* Oops: wpfb\_userinfo\_permissions was redundant; removed 🙂

* Handle relative paths in usermeta (for cached avatars)
* Get rid of some depreciated functions (get\_usermeta -> get\_user\_meta)
* Add a new hook wpfb\_add\_to\_asyncinit, so you can output your own JS after the Facebook API initializes
* Add a new filter wpfb\_userinfo\_permissions, so you can choose what userinfo permissions to ask for
* Check for function\_exists(‘is\_multisite’) to support older versions of WP
* More descriptive error message for “Nonce check failed.”
* More descriptive error message for “Failed to get the Facebook session.”

#### 2.0.0 (2011-05-19)

* As Facebook has decided to shut off the old REST API on Sept 1, 2011, I’ve rewritten the core plugin to use the new Graph API. All Premium users must also update their addons to be compatible with this new core plugin.
* Removed “IE9 compatability mode” as it’s no longer relevant.
* Removed “Request and require email permissions” as it’s no longer relevant (all permissions are requested in a single popup, so one cannot be denied while approving the others).
* Show a warning to Premium users with an outdated version of the addon.

#### 1.9.2 (2011-04-02)

* Add an “IE compatability mode”, so the old API will work on IE9. Can be disabled via debug options, but is enabled by default.

#### 1.9.1 (2011-04-01)

* CSS id fbLoginButton is now class fbLoginButton, to fix validation issue if multiple buttons are placed on the same page
* NOTE: Premium users using the “ajax spinner” feature must also update their addon!

#### 1.9.0 (2011-04-01)

* jfb\_output\_facebook\_callback() is now automatically called by wp\_footer; If you’re manually outputting your own Facebook buttons, you should now ONLY call jfb\_output\_facebook\_btn() (explicitly calling jfb\_output\_facebook\_callback() is no longer needed!)
* Premium comment-form buttons now not dependent on Widget buttons
* Output some html comments

* Fixed a bug with author links (they didn’t work because the “nicename” had a space in it)
* Removed the “Enable BuddyPress Support” option; it’s always enabled now
