Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `crm-perks-tickets` shortcode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-provided input, specifically within the shortcode attributes. This allows malicious scripts to be stored in the database and executed when a page containing the shortcode is accessed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into pages using the vulnerable shortcode. This injected script will execute within the context of a user's browser when they visit the affected page.
*   **Account Hijacking:** If an attacker injects malicious JavaScript that can steal cookies or session tokens, an attacker could potentially take over user sessions and potentially accounts.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Malicious scripts could be used to redirect users to external sites or perform other malicious activities.
*   **Data Theft:** JavaScript can be used to gather sensitive information from the page, such as form data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Shortcode Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious code by exploiting the plugin's shortcode `crm-perks-tickets`. The attacker would add attributes containing malicious scripts when using this shortcode in posts or pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with Contributor-level access or higher to create or edit posts and pages that would allow for the injection of the malicious shortcode.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was present in versions up to and including 1.1.6.
*   The vulnerability has been patched in version 1.1.7.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a Medium severity issue with a CVSS score of 6.4.
*   The vulnerable code snippet is located in `support-x/trunk/support-x.php`, specifically around line 210, 216 and 224, where the plugin uses `sanitize_text_field` instead of `esc_attr` for sanitizing attributes which are later displayed within HTML elements.
*   The patch replaces the `sanitize_text_field` function with `esc_attr` for output escaping in the mentioned lines.
