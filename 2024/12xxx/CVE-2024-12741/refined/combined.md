### Driver

* NI-DAQ™mx

## Issue Details

I want to start acquiring data but I do not have a license to LabVIEW. I want to start using my hardware in the easiest way possible.

## Solution

The [Lite edition of FlexLogger](https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/software-products/download.flexlogger.html) is free companion software for NI data acquisition hardware. You can use it to quickly configure, log, and monitor mixed-signal systems. You can also choose to upgrade anytime to the full-featured FlexLogger for more complex tasks such as automations, triggers, and alarms.

[Using the NI-DAQmx driver](https://www.ni.com/en/support/documentation/supplemental/06/getting-started-with-ni-daqmx--main-page.html), you can also program your hardware in C/C++, Python, or other text-based languages.

You can also use the [Test Panels in Measurement & Automation Explorer](https://knowledge.ni.com/KnowledgeArticleDetails?id=kA03q000000YGZPCA4&l=en-US)  to perform a simple test.

## Additional Information

### DAQExpress is now End of Life

NI previously included DAQExpress software with most DAQ hardware. DAQExpress is now obsolete, and it has been replaced by FlexLogger Lite.
