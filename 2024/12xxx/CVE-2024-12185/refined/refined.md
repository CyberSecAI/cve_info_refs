The provided content relates to CVE-2024-12185.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stack overflow caused by an unbounded `scanf` function when reading the administrator password.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow due to the use of `scanf("%s", str2)` without limiting the input size, where `str2` is a fixed-size buffer (20 bytes).
- Lack of input validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to write beyond the allocated buffer on the stack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program crash due to memory corruption (access violation).
- Potential for denial of service (DoS) by crashing the application.
- With further exploitation, may lead to arbitrary code execution by overwriting return addresses on the stack (not detailed in the provided text but is a possible consequence).

**Attack vectors:**
- Providing an overly long input string as the administrator password.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to interact with the application and input the admin password string.

**Additional details:**
- The code snippet utilizes a fixed-size character array (`str2`) of 20 bytes to store the admin password, but uses `scanf("%s", str2)` which reads the input until a whitespace, without taking into account the bounds of the buffer causing the overflow when a string longer than 20 bytes is supplied as input.
- The provided proof of concept (POC) demonstrates that supplying an input of 300 'a' characters triggers the crash.
