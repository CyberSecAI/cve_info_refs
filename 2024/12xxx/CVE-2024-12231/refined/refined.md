- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper input sanitization and validation in the `/index.php` file of the "Project Management System In PHP And MYSQL With Source Code". The `email` parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper escaping or parameterization, allowing for SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability in the `/index.php` file. The application fails to sanitize or validate user-supplied data, specifically the 'email' parameter, before using it in SQL queries.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database, leading to:
    - Sensitive data leakage
    - Data tampering
    - Comprehensive system control
    - Service interruption.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted HTTP POST requests with malicious SQL code in the 'email' parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be remote, with no need for prior login or authorization. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
