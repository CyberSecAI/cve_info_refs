  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `JaninoEventEvaluator` component allowed arbitrary code execution (ACE) due to its ability to evaluate expressions in configuration files, making it possible to execute arbitrary code through a crafted configuration.",

      "Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with the ability to modify logback's configuration file could execute arbitrary code on the server.",

      "Maliciously crafted logback configuration files"

    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have write access to logback's configuration file, and the application must reload the poisoned configuration. This can occur on application restart or if `scan=\"true\"` is set in the configuration."
