## **WoodMart WooCommerce WordPress Theme**

WoodMart is a premium theme optimized for creating WooCommerce online stores that
provides a super-fast interface for the ultimate user experience

Compatible with the latest version of WordPress 6.7+ and WooCommerce 9.4+

## Business, Marketplace, Retail

“If you build it, they will come”

‘WoodMart’ is a **premium WordPress theme​** designed from the ground up for building
**supreme WooCommerce online stores​** of any kind. Focussed on **user experience​** first
WoodMart uses a **powerful AJAX tech​** to give users a very **fast and seamless online
shopping interface​** without the need to constantly refresh pages.

Build any kind of **online store** ​you can imagine and **start earning that passive revenue
stream​** you have been thinking about with ‘WoodMart’ for **WordPress​** and never look back.

## All-In-One eCommerce Solution

**WoodMart WooCommerce theme** doesn’t require tons of plugins to run your online store. The most important features
come out of the box and you don’t need to purchase anything extra. **Wishlist, compare, product swatches**, AJAX filters,
built-in slider and other features will save you from installing at least 10-20 unnecessary plugins. Use our
quick **setup wizard** and run your online store in a few clicks.

## Theme Settings Panel

With a powerful **Theme Settings Panel** ​that allows you to change a plethora of **Theme Settings
with a single click​**, you **don’t need any coding experience​**. Without the need for multiple
plugins to power it **WoodMart is smart, lean and fast**,​ so you can get on with business. The
Theme Settings panel gives you a graphical interface to make simple changes quickly and
easily.

## Fully Customizable

Everything has been tweaked and developed to respond to your **customization requests​** with
a minimum of fuss so what you are left with is a highly customizable website that can adapt to
your **change requests​** easily and quickly.

Change up your **fonts, update your colour palette** ​to you meet your **brand guidelines​**, update
your swatches to show multiple **product variations​** – it’s all accessible from the familiarity of the intuitive **WordPress dashboard​**.

## Optimized for Google Page Speed

Website **performance** is one of the key factors for **Google rankings** starting from 2021.
With WoodMart WordPress theme you don’t need to fight with slow websites anymore. We spent hundreds of hours
experising and implementing the best practice techniques in **speed optimization** and performance field. WoodMart
has a unique mechanism to load CSS and JS files only on pages where they are needed. And it will reduce the
total page size by 2-3 times comparing to other WordPress themes.

## Responsive Design

Of course WoodMart features a **completely responsive design​** that **manipulates itself​** to best
suit the device it is being viewed on. This means you can carry on with the best part like **listing items for sale​**, **creating a killer shop​** and leaving the technical stuff up to the developers.

We guarantee that your website will **display fluidly across every device​** type you can think of
without any extra effort on your part – **laptops, PCs, smartphones​ and tablets​** – have been carefully thought out and included in this smart website theme design​.

## Retina Ready

We’ve also made sure that your **new website**​ will display with the **highest possible pixel
density​** as per users device. If that happens to be a **retina ready device​** then that display will
light up with colors that are simply **out of this world**.

Make the most of your photography with this **retina ready theme for WordPress​**, you won’t
regret it.

## SEO Optimization

**SEO is like the hottest buzzword​** of the decade but put simply it means that your website
needs to be coded a certain way so that **Search Engines like Google and Bing​** can find the
right stuff it needs to, to **rank your page correctly​**.

This means **clean code​**, well designed, and support for almost all popular SEO plugins that give you more control over use of the **right metadata​** in the right place, and being
free of bloat​.

## Powerful AJAX

**AJAX​** or **Asynchronous Javascript and XML​**, is a group of techniques used in web
development which allows a web page to communicate with a server without reloading the
page. This is best witnessed when searching through products. You know you haven’t got an
**AJAX powered site​** when every category change or product swatch update you make the
whole page flickers and reloads.

Not with WoodMart. Using the best tech available we have gotten away from that problem with
galleries of products of any kind with stacks of possible types and kinds that simply update as
you select them. It provides your customers with the kind of experience you’d expect in a
**leading marketplace online today​**. Live up to their expectations with **WoodMart for
WordPress​** – simple.

## Over 88 Demo Websites. 400+ Premade Sections

A **great website​** should have a nice supply of demo layouts to get you started and we
recognized this from the outset and went out hard from the gate with over **70 stunning layouts**
for you to choose from. You can use our theme for any kind of store including **furniture**, **fashion**, clothing,
**electronics**, watches, glasses, sport, shoes, **jewellery**, cosmetics and a lot of others. Our theme is also suitable for **corporate** and **magazine** websites
and you can use it without WooCommerce.

With our extensive **templates library for Elementor** and WPBakery you can prototype your pages blazing fast.
Take sections from different demos and pages and combine them in new creative and eye-catching pages.
Don’t waste your time configuring everything from scratch. Just import a few sections and write your texts.
You can find sections for any needs and in tons of different styles.

## Advanced Variable Products

Being able to **apply multiple product variables and swatches to products​** in your store is a
must. WoodMart is optimized by allowing you to have one **listing but show many colours​** for
instances, or a **certain product that has multiple sizes, types, styles, purposes**.

This gives your shop so much **more depth​** with every product being able to have **multiple
attributes and variations​**, and as soon as they are added to your Cart they appear, no page
reloads, no refresh necessary. Once you’ve tried it there’s no looking back.

## Drag & Drop Header Builder!

A great user experience often starts with an awesome header design, and as silly as that may
sound to some it is often overlooked. With the next iteration of WoodMart we release a
powerful ‘Drag & Drop’ header builder that gives you complete control over designing your
headers. Drag blocks into place, label them, update background images, colours, borders,
padding you name it. All with a simple GUI that anyone can use to build something really
unique.

### Unlimited possibilities with WoodMart!

### Description

The Woodmart theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 8.0.3. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do\_shortcode through the woodmart\_instagram\_ajax\_query AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.
