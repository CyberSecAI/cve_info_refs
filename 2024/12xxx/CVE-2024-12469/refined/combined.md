### Description

The WP BASE Booking of Appointments, Services and Events plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘status’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 4.9.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

I had issue with the Plugins not notifying Provider/Admin when there are new pending request in the que and Hakan was able to pin point the issue in less than a day. It was caused by a different plugin. He was a great help. The plugins works the way I wanted it to work and other other plugin work just as well.
Thank you again,

I manage a website for a small village community. One of the essential features of the website is the ability to book the village hall. I searched for a suitable plugin in the WordPress CMS, trying out many options. I needed a simple tool that allows users to select a date and start and finish time from the front end. However, most of the plugins at the top of the search results didn’t offer this feature without requiring a premium subscription. After trying out several plugins, I found WP Base. Although it required a subscription, I was impressed by the presentation and features of the Essentials bundle and the Variable Durations Add-on. WP Base provided everything I needed at a competitive price and had the best front-end presentation and user-friendliness. Whenever I needed guidance, Haken responded quickly and was very helpful.

WP Base is an ultra-complete plugin for making appointments. I use it for a directory of professionals on which you can make appointments, receive appointment reminder SMS and emails, and even have appointments directly by video, payable via the site. It’s the perfect solution for my project, there are a large number of integrations and features that can be activated/deactivated as needed. I specify that I use Geodirectory for the directory and Buddyboss for the community. And WP BASE integrates these two plugins, it’s just perfect. In addition to that, as soon as I am in difficulty with a configuration or when I have a question, Hakan responds very quickly, he always has a solution, it is a pleasure to benefit from such support. I do not regret my choice and I recommend this plugin and this developer without hesitation.

We purchased the full licence of WP-Base for a BuddyBoss (buddypress) Membership website.
Our Member types can purchase AirBnb type products from each other.Hakan has been extremely pro-active in fine tuning and tweaking the plugin to suit our needs. Adding additional features with each new update.I have used many Booking plugins in the past, all with various features, but WP-Base has a huge amount of customisations you can make, lots of hooks for developers and full control over styling of calendars etc.I love it for our purpose, it suits us perfectly.Thanks Hakan from great customer support.

After searching and trying for ages to find a booking plugin we were lucky to find WP BASE
The free core gives you all the power to setup a comprehensive booking service.  All the others we have tested you will pay for most of these features. We use it for services, resort bookings, events and tours. For us, the only modules not included in the free version are:
Take payments online. Although you can setup Direct Payments you can have more gateways when getting the WooCommerce addon (purchase). Our feeling is that the plugin needs more gateways options but is sure it will come with time.
Service providers. A paid addon is available to setup service providers at a very affordable rate.
The plugin was design with a well though logical flow and the moment you understand it, you can setup a booking system which will not break the bank. In most cases – for free!
On top of it the support is super quick – only the time zone will delay a request sometimes for an hour or 3.
Thanks Hakan – we are sure this booking plugin will grow as one of the most used in the world!
