The provided content relates to CVE-2024-12353.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of user input in the `UserInterface::MenuDisplayStart()` function. Specifically, when the user enters a mixed input string containing a number followed by non-numeric characters (e.g., "1qqqqq"), `std::cin >> choice` extracts the integer part ('1'), but leaves the remaining non-numeric characters ("qqqqq") in the input buffer. Subsequent calls to `getline(std::cin, name)` then consume these leftover characters, assigning them to the `name` variable which leads to data corruption

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Buffer Pollution:** The primary issue is that the input buffer is not cleared after using `std::cin >> choice`, leading to residual characters being read by subsequent input operations.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code lacks proper input validation to ensure that user inputs conform to the expected format. This allows for non-numeric characters to be processed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Corruption:** The polluted input buffer leads to invalid data (e.g. "qqqqq") being written to files such as `Users.txt`, causing data corruption.
- **Logic Errors:** Invalid input processing can cause unintended program behavior, such as incorrect user authentication or unexpected program states.
- **Potential Security Risks**: The vulnerability could be exploited to inject malicious input (e.g. SQL injection payloads, path traversal sequences) into the program via the polluted input buffer, leading to security breaches

**Attack vectors:**
- **User Input:** The attack vector is through user-supplied input at the program's menu. An attacker could intentionally enter mixed input that pollutes the input buffer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to interact with the program's menu, as the vulnerability is exposed through the `UserInterface::MenuDisplayStart()` function.
- No specific privilege is required, since the vulnerability occurs due to how the program handles user-provided input.
