Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a missing validation on a user-controlled key in the `post-content` shortcode within the "Get Post Content Shortcode" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The plugin allows users to directly specify a post ID to retrieve content, without proper authorization checks. This leads to an IDOR vulnerability because an attacker can manipulate the post ID.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Authenticated attackers (with Contributor-level access or higher) can exploit this vulnerability to read the content of posts that they are not normally authorized to access, including:
    *   Password-protected posts
    *   Private posts
    *   Draft posts
    *   Pending posts

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploited by using the `post-content` shortcode and specifying a post ID in the shortcode parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "Contributor" level privileges on the WordPress site.
*  **Knowledge of post ID:** Attacker needs to know (or guess) the post ID of the content they wish to access.
