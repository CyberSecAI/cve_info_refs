Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-12728:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the SSH login passphrase used for High Availability (HA) cluster initialization was not deactivated after the HA establishment process was completed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Hardcoded/default credential:** The system retained a default SSH passphrase used during the initial setup of HA, rather than generating/enforcing a new, unique, and secure password. This meant that even after HA setup, this known passphrase could be used to log into a privileged system account.
- **Privilege Escalation:**  If SSH access is enabled, this default password can be used by an attacker to gain privileged system access to Sophos Firewall.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain privileged system access by using the default SSH passphrase.
- This could potentially lead to complete compromise of the Sophos Firewall.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network access over SSH

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have network access to the Sophos Firewall's SSH port.
- The attacker must know/discover that the default HA SSH passphrase still works.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects approximately 0.5% of devices.
- The issue was discovered internally by Sophos during security testing.
- A hotfix has been released for various versions of the Sophos Firewall.
- Workarounds include restricting SSH access to the dedicated HA link, reconfiguring HA using a custom passphrase, and disabling WAN access via SSH, relying on VPN and Sophos Central for management.
