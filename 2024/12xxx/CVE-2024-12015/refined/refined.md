Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2024-12015:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of the `orderby` parameter in the `/pm/v2/activities` route of the Project Manager WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary weakness is the presence of an SQL injection vulnerability. This occurs because user-supplied input in the `orderby` parameter is not sanitized before being used in a database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  **Information Disclosure:** Although the CVSS vector indicates "C:H" (High Confidentiality impact), the provided details and proof-of-concept only demonstrate the ability to cause a delayed response using the SLEEP() function in the SQL query. It is likely that sensitive data can be obtained by exploiting this SQL injection. However this is not explicitly stated.
- Potential for more severe impacts like data modification or deletion might be possible depending on the underlying database schema and application logic, although they are not detailed in the provided text.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the `/pm/v2/activities` route of the WordPress REST API.
- The vulnerable parameter is `orderby`.
- The attacker injects malicious SQL code within the `orderby` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the WordPress site.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a request like:
  `http://WORDPRESS/?rest_route=/pm/v2/activities&orderby=id/**/AND/**/(SELECT/**/1/**/FROM/**/(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))a)`
- This payload uses the SQL `SLEEP()` function to cause a time delay, confirming the SQL injection.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability exists in the "Project Manager" WordPress plugin.
- Tenable assigned the advisory ID TRA-2024-47 to this vulnerability.
- The recommended solution is to remove the Project Manager plugin.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Joshua Martinelle.
- CVSSv3 score: 7.7 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N)
- CVSSv4 score: 8.3 (AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:N/SA:N)

**Timeline:**
- Tenable tried to contact WeDevs on October 11, October 18, and November 4, 2024.
- The initial release of the advisory was on December 02, 2024.
