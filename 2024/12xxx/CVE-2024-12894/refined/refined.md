The provided content is related to CVE-2024-12894. It shows a commit that fixes a SQL injection vulnerability in `acesso.php` and `checkflag.php` files.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability was caused by directly embedding unsanitized user-controlled input into SQL queries, specifically in the `$usuario` and `$problema` variables.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could manipulate the SQL queries by injecting malicious code, potentially allowing them to access or modify sensitive data, bypass authentication, or perform other unauthorized actions.
- **Attack vectors**: By injecting malicious SQL code through the `usuario` and `problema` POST parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP POST requests to `acesso.php` and `checkflag.php` with malicious SQL code injected in the `usuario` or `problema` parameters.

The commit replaces the vulnerable code:
```php
$usuario = filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'usuario');
$sql = "SELECT * FROM Usuario where id='$usuario'";
```
with:
```php
$usuario = filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'usuario', FILTER_SANITIZE_NUMBER_INT);
$sql = "SELECT * FROM Usuario where id=:usuario";
```
and
```php
$problema = filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'problema');
```
with:
```php
$problema = filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'problema', FILTER_SANITIZE_NUMBER_INT);
```
This sanitizes the input to prevent the injection.
Additionally, it changes to use prepared statements which helps prevent injection attacks.
