Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-12182:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of the `body` parameter within the `/member/soft_add.php` script of DedeCMS version 5.7.116.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The lack of proper input validation and sanitization for the `body` parameter allows injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into software information pages. When other users view these compromised pages, the injected scripts execute in their browsers.
- This can lead to various malicious activities, potentially compromising the security of the website and its users (e.g., session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, etc.)

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack can be launched remotely.
- The vulnerability is located in the `/member/soft_add.php` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to register as a member on the website.
- The attacker needs the capability to publish software information ('soft') content.
- No user interaction is required for the attack to be successful after the malicious script is injected.
- The attacker must have low privileges to exploit the vulnerability

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by submitting a crafted POST request to `/member/soft_add.php`.
- The `body` parameter within the POST request is used to inject malicious JavaScript code. An example payload `<p>asd</p><svg/onload=alert(document.cookie)>` is provided.
- The provided proof of concept (PoC) shows how to inject a simple javascript alert, but more complex and dangerous payloads could be injected.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is classified as moderate severity.
- CVSS v4 base metrics:  CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X
- The EPSS score is 0.066%.
- CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting) is listed as the weakness.
