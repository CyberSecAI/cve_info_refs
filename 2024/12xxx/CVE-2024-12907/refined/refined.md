- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how the Kentico CMS version 7 handles user-controlled input passed through a GET request parameter when accessing the `/CMSMessages/AccessDenied.aspx` endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied data, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the page.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, phishing, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious GET request to the `/CMSMessages/AccessDenied.aspx` endpoint. The attacker manipulates a specific GET parameter to inject the XSS payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a specific URL with a malicious payload and trick a user into accessing it. No special access or privilege is required beyond this. The vulnerable system must be an instance of Kentico CMS version 7, which is no longer supported by the vendor.
