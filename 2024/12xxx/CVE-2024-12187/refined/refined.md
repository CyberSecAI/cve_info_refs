Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12187 (based on the title of the GitHub issue)

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `/showbook.php` file of the "Library Management System BCA 4th Semester Minor Project using SQL and PHP" project.
- The code directly uses the 'q' parameter from the HTTP GET request in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection due to the lack of proper input sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized database access:** Attackers can gain access to the database without proper authorization.
- **Sensitive data leakage:** Attackers can read sensitive data from the database.
- **Data tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database.
- **System control:** Attackers may gain control of the entire system by exploiting the vulnerability.
- **Service interruption:** Attackers can disrupt the normal operation of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET request with a malicious value for the 'q' parameter in the URL.
   - Example:  `10.211.55.6:1115/showbook.php?q=<malicious SQL code>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker doesn't need to be logged in or authorized, as no login is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP GET requests to the server where the vulnerable application is hosted.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided PoC (Proof of Concept) payloads demonstrate different types of SQL injection attacks:
    - Boolean-based blind
    - Error-based
    - Time-based blind

**Suggested Repair:**
-   **Use Prepared Statements:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to separate SQL code from user input.
-   **Input Validation and Filtering:** Implement strict input validation to ensure data matches expected formats and filters out malicious characters.
-   **Least Privilege Database Access:** Limit the database user's permissions.
-   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct code reviews and security audits to find and fix potential flaws.
