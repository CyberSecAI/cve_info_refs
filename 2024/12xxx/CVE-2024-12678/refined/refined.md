- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the inclusion of an unredacted Workload Identity token in the response of the Read Allocation API and `alloc` command. This token provides access to workload-associated variables and service discovery, and when combined with workload-associated ACL policies, it enables privilege escalation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of the unredacted Workload Identity token, combined with the ability to associate ACL policies with workloads, creates a vulnerability to privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A user with `namespace:read` access can leverage the exposed Workload Identity token to escalate privileges within the namespace and access additional policies beyond their intended scope.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker exploits the Read Allocation API or `alloc` command to retrieve the unredacted Workload Identity token.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have `namespace:read` access in order to exploit this vulnerability.
