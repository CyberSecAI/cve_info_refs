Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization check on the `elex_dp_export_rules()` and `elex_dp_import_rules()` functions within the ELEX WooCommerce Dynamic Pricing and Discounts plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Missing Authorization:** The core weakness is the lack of proper access controls. These functions, meant to be used by authorized users, can be accessed by unauthenticated users.
*   **Data Exposure:** The `elex_dp_export_rules()` function allows the export of product rules, potentially revealing sensitive pricing and discount configurations.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The `elex_dp_import_rules()` function allows importing rules, which could lead to malicious modification of pricing and discounts.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The `elex_dp_export_rules()` function additionally exports `phpinfo()` data which can reveal sensitive information about server configuration.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized data access:** Unauthenticated attackers can gain access to product rules, pricing configurations, and other sensitive data.
*   **Data manipulation:** Attackers can import malicious rules, potentially altering product prices, creating unauthorized discounts, or otherwise disrupting the store's operation.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Exporting `phpinfo()` data could expose server configurations, aiding further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is exploited via HTTP requests to the vulnerable plugin functions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** Attackers require network access to the WordPress site to send malicious requests.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of the plugin up to and including 2.1.7.
*   The vulnerability was corrected in version 2.1.8.
*   The vulnerability is related to a missing capability check on the mentioned functions.
*   The vulnerability was reported by a researcher using Wordfence.
