Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12497

**Content relates to:** The content from github.com specifically identifies a SQL injection vulnerability in the "1000projects Attendance Tracking Management System PHP & MySQL Project V1.0". While the other content is from 1000projects.org, it is unrelated to the identified vulnerability

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user input within the `admin_user_name` parameter in the `/admin/check_admin_login.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code directly into the SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application does not use prepared statements or parameterized queries, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.
*   Insufficient Input Validation: The application does not validate or sanitize the `admin_user_name` parameter, allowing malicious SQL code to be included.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Unauthorized Database Access: Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
*   Sensitive Data Leakage: Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.
*   Data Tampering: Attackers can modify or delete data in the database.
*   Comprehensive System Control: In severe cases, attackers can potentially achieve full control over the system.
*   Service Interruption: Attackers can disrupt the system's normal operation.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vector is via the `admin_user_name` parameter of the `/admin/check_admin_login.php` script, which is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the `/admin/check_admin_login.php` endpoint with a crafted `admin_user_name` parameter.
*   No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability, making it easily exploitable by unauthenticated users

**Additional Details:**
*   The provided Github issue contains detailed payloads for exploiting the vulnerability. It identifies that the vulnerability is exploitable through boolean-based blind, stacked queries, and time-based blind SQL injection techniques.
*   The issue also provides a `sqlmap` command used to confirm the vulnerability and screenshots demonstrating the database information being extracted.
*   The suggested repairs include:
    * Using prepared statements and parameter binding.
    * Implementing input validation and filtering.
    * Minimizing database user permissions.
    * Conducting regular security audits.
