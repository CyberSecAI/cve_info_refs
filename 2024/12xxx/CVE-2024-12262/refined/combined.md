### Description

The Ebook Store plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 'step' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 5.8001 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

I have been trying to get support via emails, contact forms, Skype calls for weeks all without a response. I have just installed Ebook Store and I’m stuck at a point where I can’t get the store up and running. I bought the Pro version. Still no response from support.
Can anyone tell me what’s going on or how to get a refund?

This plugin didn’t work for me. The interface to upload files is shit. I have some large files (100mb+) that I cannot protect because the only way to upload is with the windows file selector instead of the Wordpress one and no field to put and URL for the file. Also, you can only add one file per product, no support for multiple files of the same type at all.

I got the eBook plug-in for a client so he could provide eBook downloads for free from his website. I was able to easily integrate it into our existing woocommerce account and theme. When I hit a snag, support was able to help do exactly what I needed.

I emailed the developer twice with no response.
The plugin forces you to also use WooCommerce
in order for it to work.
I switched to WP express checkout which
is much easier to work with.

Update: The developer did finally update the plugin and fixed the error on our website. Apparently you only get 2 years of support and lifetime upgrades. The plugin is great for what we need and we didn’t have any troubles until recently.
\*The plugin E-Book Store is now broken on our site (critical error) and no one has responded to our support emails.

Love it! Has been working well. Support took care of my own issues a couple of times when I was having troubles and fixed the problem. Thanks!
