{
  "CVE-2024-12089": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding when handling user-supplied data within the ENOVIA Collaborative Industry Innovator application.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the browser session of a user interacting with the vulnerable application. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the user interface.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the injection of malicious script code, which is then stored within the application and executed when a user interacts with the affected data.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to find an entry point in the application where they can inject malicious code that will be stored and later executed in the victim's browser. This requires an understanding of the application's functionality and data handling mechanisms. The attacker might need to be an authenticated user to perform this action, depending on the specific injection points available."
