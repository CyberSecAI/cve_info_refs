Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-12047:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content from wordfence.com explicitly mentions CVE-2024-12047 and describes a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the WP Compress plugin. The other provided content is supporting documentation that is related to the vulnerable plugin.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `custom_server` parameter.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts that will execute in a victim's browser if they are tricked into clicking a malicious link. This could lead to actions performed within the userâ€™s authenticated session (if the user is logged in), like modification or exfiltration of information.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL with a payload in the `custom_server` parameter.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
    *   The attacker must convince a user to click on a crafted link.

**3. Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in the `cdn-rewrite.php` file, specifically related to handling the `custom_server` parameter.
*   The issue affects all versions of the WP Compress plugin up to and including 6.30.03.
*   Version 6.30.04 is a patched version that addresses the vulnerability.

**4. Technical Details:**

The following provides a more in depth understanding of how the plugin handles and uses the custom\_server parameter which is located in the file `wp-compress-image-optimizer/tags/6.30.00/addons/cdn/cdn-rewrite.php`.  

```php
    public function dnsPrefetch()
    {
        if (strlen(trim(self::$zone_name)) > 0) {
            if (!empty($_GET['dbg']) && $_GET['dbg'] == 'direct') {
                if (!empty($_GET['custom_server'])) {
                    self::$zone_name = $_GET['custom_server'] . '/key:' . self::$options['api_key'];
                    echo '<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="//' . $_GET['custom_server'] . '" />';
                }
            } else {
                echo '<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://optimizerwpc.b-cdn.net" />';
                echo '<link rel="preconnect" href="https://optimizerwpc.b-cdn.net">';
                echo '<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="//' . self::$zone_name . '" />';
                echo '<link rel="preconnect" href="https://' . self::$zone_name . '">';
            }
        }
    }
```

The vulnerable code can be found in the `dnsPrefetch()` function on line 455-470. The code takes the `custom_server` parameter from the GET request and uses this to create a `dns-prefetch` element. The `custom_server` parameter is not sanitized before being output in an HTML attribute. This is a clear case of a reflected XSS.

**Summary:**

CVE-2024-12047 is a medium-severity reflected XSS vulnerability in the WP Compress plugin.  The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in a victim's browser via a crafted link containing a malicious payload in the `custom_server` parameter. Users of the plugin should upgrade to version 6.30.04 or later to mitigate this risk.
