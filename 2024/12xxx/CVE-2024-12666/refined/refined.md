```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly restrict non-admin users from modifying the group memberships of admin users, leading to a vertical privilege escalation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Vertical privilege escalation: Non-admin users can modify admin user group memberships.",
    "Insufficient input validation: The system does not properly validate user input related to group role assignments",
    "Lack of authorization checks: The application lacks proper checks to prevent non-admin users from modifying admin user's roles."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Non-admin users can remove admin users from the admin group, effectively locking all admin users out of the admin group and disrupting the website.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/admin?do=admin:user:editPost` with modified `rolehash` parameter to change the group membership of an admin user.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs a valid account with permissions for \"Modify User Account\" and \"Role Management\" but does not need admin level privileges."
