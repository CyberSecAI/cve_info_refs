Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding in `vendor_management.php`. Specifically, user-supplied data from the `nome` parameter is directly echoed back to the page without any filtering or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. The application directly reflects user-provided input in the output without sanitization, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Sensitive information disclosure:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This allows them to steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
- **Account compromise:** By stealing session cookies, attackers can impersonate logged-in users, leading to unauthorized access to accounts.
- **Malware distribution:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites or execute drive-by downloads.
- **Defacement:** Attackers can alter the content of the vulnerable page.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** An attacker could craft a URL with a malicious script in the `nome` parameter and trick users into clicking the URL.
- **Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack:** An attacker could intercept and modify traffic to inject malicious code.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers could use social engineering to trick users into submitting the crafted malicious payload via a form.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a URL with malicious javascript in the `nome` parameter.
- The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking on the crafted URL or make a request to the vulnerable application with the crafted payload.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `vendor_management.php` file.
- The `nome` parameter is vulnerable.
- The provided example payload demonstrates a simple alert box (`<script>alert(1)</script>`). However, more complex and malicious payloads are possible.
