Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12501

**Root Cause:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the Simple Locator plugin's shortcodes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape user-provided data used in shortcode attributes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the affected page.
- This could lead to various malicious activities such as:
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By using the plugin's shortcodes with malicious attributes
- Specifically the `simple_locator` and `simple_locator_all_locations` shortcodes are affected
- Example attributes are `orderby`, `ids`, and `noresultstext` in `AllLocationsShortcode.php` and taxonomy attributes within the `FormShortcode.php`
- This attack requires an authenticated user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This is because the vulnerability exists in the context of adding or editing content, which requires that level of permission.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Simple Locator plugin up to and including 2.0.3.
- The vulnerability was reported by a researcher named yudha.
- The fix was implemented in version 2.0.4 by adding `esc_attr` to user controlled data before rendering on the page.
- Patches were applied to `app/API/AllLocationsShortcode.php` and `app/API/FormShortcode.php` to sanitize the user input.
- The update also includes a fix for JS bugs related to multiple maps.
