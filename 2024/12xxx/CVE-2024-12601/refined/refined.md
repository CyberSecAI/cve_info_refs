**Vulnerability:** Denial of Service (DoS)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of input sanitization and validation for the height and width parameters used to generate CAPTCHA images. The plugin doesn't impose any limit on the size of the image requested.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
  - Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
  - Lack of Input sanitization
  - Lack of input validation

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - An unauthenticated attacker can cause a denial of service condition by sending multiple requests with arbitrarily large values for the CAPTCHA image width and height parameters, resulting in resource exhaustion (CPU, Memory, etc.) on the server and potentially crashing the service.

**Attack Vectors:**
  - HTTP GET requests with manipulated parameters

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - Unauthenticated access to the web server.
  - Ability to send HTTP requests.
