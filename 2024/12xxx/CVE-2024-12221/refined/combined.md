### Description

The Turnkey bbPress by WeaverTheme plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘\_wpnonce’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

## Description

Finally, you can get a great looking bbPress site with just one plugin. No need for custom CSS or PHP programming. Turnkey bbPress! (Formerly named *Weaver for bbPress* by WeaverTheme.)

Get your bbPress site up and running with beautiful themed styling, plus all the essential layout and user/admin usability options needed to run a real world forum with **Turnkey bbPress**.

**Turnkey bbPress** was developed by the makers of the popular *Weaver Xtreme* WordPress theme, the *original* options based WP theme. If there’s one thing we know, it’s how to provide the features and options you need to build a great looking website. And now you can do that with a bbPress site.

We also know *bbPress* was designed to be lightweight and efficient, but that means that many features required to build and run a real-world forum are missing from the base *ppPress* plugin.

**Turnkey bbPress** makes it easy.

#### Live Support Site

See *Turnkey bbPress* in action, live! Visit the [*Weaver Support Forum*](//forum.weavertheme.com).

#### Turnkey bbPress Features

**Just checkout all the features offered by Turnkey bbPress!**

* **Add Style! Blends with virtually any WP Theme**
* **Tweak Forum and Topic List Layout**
* **New Usability Features for Participants**
* **Admin Options**
* **Compatibility with Other ppPress Plugins**
* **Great Support**

#### Add Style to your Forum!

The default *bbPress* theme is okay – it works fairly blandly with almost any theme.

**Turnkey bbPress** adds a collection of several new bbPress Themes that blend beautifully with virtually any existing WP Theme, all with just a single pick from a list. Tweak any of the the basic pre-defined styles with additional check-box options that allow additional styling.

* **Pre-defined subThemes**: Many pre-defined subThemes included, designed to work with nearly any WP Theme.
* **SubThemes Blend**: SubThemes designed to blend with specific and general color themes.
* **Inherited WP Theme Style**: The font family and link styles of your WordPress theme are used in the bbPress subTheme.
* **Forum Font Size**: Set the base font size for your forum. One setting to make font size larger or smaller to match your WP theme.
* **Avatar Options**: Extra styling options for the “Started by” and “Freshness” Participant avatars that make them really stand out.
* **Even/Odd Row Styling**: Optional even/odd row background coloring.
* **Style Feature Buttons**: Display “Subscribe”, “Create New Topic” and “Mark all as read” as theme matching buttons on right side.
* **bbPress Login Widget**: The standard bbPress Login Widget and associated shortcodes are styled to match the theme.
* **Better Closed, Favorited, Subscribed**: Show informative icons for Closed, Favorited, and Subscribed Topics and Forums.
* **Custom CSS**: Add you own tweaks with custom CSS rules.
* **Your own bbPress.css**: Provide your own custom version of bbPress.css if you don’t like our styles.

#### Tweak Forum and Topic List Layout

Hide various elements of Forum and Topic Lists.

* **Forum Description**: Add the Forum Description to top of Single Forum Views.
* **Subforums in Columns**” Display Subforum in Columns rather than a comma separated list.
* **Voices/Posts Counts**: Hide Voices/Posts Counts on Forum Lists.
* **Hide Tiny Avatars in Notices**
* **Forum/Topic Header Info**: Hide the “This forum/topic contains count … ” info at top of lists.
* **Account Ability Message**: Hide the “Your account has the ability to post …” message above post/reply editor.

Each of these features can be enabled separately.

#### New Usability Features for Participants

* **Mentions**: When a Participant is mentioned with an **@** in a post, they can be automatically notified by email.
* **Best Answer**: When enabled, allows topic author (or moderator) to mark one reply as the best answer. Displays status indicators when a question has been marked answered.
* **Private Replies**: Allows Participants to mark replies as Private – readable only by the Participant, the topic originator, and Moderators.
* **Profile Visibility**: Set global Profile Visibility, as well as allow Participants to set their own Profile as private.
* **View Counter**: Display counter to show how many times a topic has been viewed.
* **Create New Topic**: Add “Create New Topic” link at top right of Single Forum views.
* **Indicator Icons for Favorited and Subscribed**: Easy to see favorites and subscriptions.

#### Admin Options

**Turnkey bbPress** adds options that makes administering your bbPress Forum easier.

* **Save/Restore Settings**: Save and Restore **Turnkey bbPress** settings to your own computer.
* **Visual Editor**: Enable the Visual Editor for creating topics and replies.
* **Create New Topic Posting Instructions**: Add posting instructions to “Create New Topic” form.
* **Topic Resolution**: Enable topic resolution indicator for support forums: Resolved, Not Resolved, Not a Question, or none.
* **WP Admin Bar**: Hide that pesky WP Admin Bar for any combination of Participants, Moderators, and Admins.
* **Site Email Address**: Allows you to override the From: and email address values for emails originating with your Forum.
* **Redirect Register/Lost Password**: Redirects wp-login.php and wp-signup.php attempts to a site specific Register/Password page.
* **Status Indicators**: Show status indicators for special topics and replies: Private Reply, Spam, Trash. End the confusion.
* **Profile Email Link**: Add a mailto: email link to user Profile. Make it easier for Moderators to send direct emails.
* **Auto Block Spam Authors**: Automatically Block Authors of topics or replies when marked as SPAM by Moderators.
* **Disable bbPress Moderation**: The new bbPress will automatically and silently mark new posts and replies as Pending depending on the results of a new moderation system. This will disable that.

#### Compatibility with Other bbPress Plugins

There are other excellent plugins available that can add more essential features to a *bbPress* Forum. Unfortunately, sometimes they add features that don’t including styling that matches the rest of your forum, or doesn’t work will with some WP Themes. We’ve added integrated styling support for other plugins.

* **bbPress Pencil Unread**: We think the ability to know if posts have been read or not is essential. **Turnkey bbPress** adds color matched Unread indicators and makes the “Mark Unread” link a theme matched button at the top of forum lists.

#### The essentials, all in one

The developer of this plugin also created the original and best options based WordPress theme: Weaver Xtreme. Weaver Xtreme has its own bbPress based support forum. In the process of running the support forum, we’ve found that the features included in this plugin are really essential for running a truly vibrant forum, especially one used for technical support.

**Turnkey bbPress** is small and efficient. Options are only loaded and used if individually enabled. No unnecessary code bloat!

#### Great Support

We do not support **Turnkey bbPress** on the default WordPress Support Forum. Instead, we support it only on our own *bbPress* based forum: [Weaver Support Forum](//forum.weavertheme.com).

It is easy to get started with **Turnkey bbPress**. Get more documentation at [Turnkey bbPress Guide](//guide.weavertheme.com/category/weaver-for-bbpress/).

#### Acknowledgements

This plugin includes GPL code derived from several other bbPress plugins. I would like to acknowledge the efforts put into developing those plugins.

### [THANK YOU!](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/thank-you-1595/)

I was just about to give up on bbPress before I found this plugin.
bbPress works (functionally) but the only way to change the look & feel was with PHP & CSS coding, which I don’t know much about.
I was so happy to find Weaver for bbPress — now I can change the look & feel, set many display options etc. without any PHP or CSS coding required.
Honestly I don’t understand how anyone can use bbPress without “Weaver for bbPress”.
Thank you so much!
