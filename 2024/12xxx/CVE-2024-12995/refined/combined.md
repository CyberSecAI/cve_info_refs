## Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Project Task Description in ruifang-tech Rebuild 3.8.6

### Description:

A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Rebuild 3.8.6, within the project task description input functionality. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious JavaScript or HTML payloads into task descriptions. The payload is executed whenever any project group members views an affected task.

### Affected Component:

Project task description input functionality

### Type of Vulnerability:

CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')

### Impact:

Allows execution of malicious scripts in the context of the affected user. Attackers may exfiltrate session information, impersonate users, or redirect them to phishing sites.

### Steps to Reproduce / PoC:

* Navigate to the project tasks section in Rebuild 3.8.6: `http://localhost:18080/project/050-9000000000000001/tasks`
* Click an existing task, or create a new task.
* Add a description to the opened task, using a malicious payload. Note that basic XSS payloads are sanitized, but insufficient.
* As a PoC, the below XSS payload executes whenever users hover over the task description:

```
<IMG SRC="bad" onmouseover="alert('xss')">
```

* The below XSS payload executes immediately when the task is opened up

```
<IMG SRC="bad" onerror="alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))"></img>
```

* Save the task description.
* The malicious payload will execute in the victim's browser.

### Root Cause:

The application fails to properly sanitize or escape user-supplied input in the project task description functionality, allowing malicious code to be stored and executed.

### Mitigation Recommendations:

* Input Validation: Ensure that all user inputs are validated and sanitized on the server side.
* Output Encoding: Encode output when rendering user-supplied data in the browser (e.g., HTML entity encoding).
* Use Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a strict CSP to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.
