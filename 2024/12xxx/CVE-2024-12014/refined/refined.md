Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12014

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper implementation of security controls in the eSignaViewer component by Lleidanet PKI SL.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Path Traversal:** Attackers can manipulate file paths to access restricted files and directories.
    *   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** Insufficient authorization checks on user-controlled object references (like document IDs) allow attackers to bypass permissions and access unauthorized resources.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Unauthorized access to potentially sensitive files.
    *   Potential regulatory violations.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Manipulating file paths to perform path traversal.
    *   Manipulating object identifiers (e.g., document IDs) to perform IDOR attacks.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to manipulate inputs such as file paths and object identifiers.
    *   No authentication is required.
