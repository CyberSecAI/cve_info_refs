Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12596

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the LifterLMS plugin's `llms_delete_cert` action. Specifically, the code did not verify if the user performing the deletion had the necessary `manage_lifterlms` capability before proceeding with the action.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing Authorization Check:** The primary weakness is the absence of a capability check before allowing the deletion of arbitrary posts, which includes certificates.
*   **Arbitrary Post Deletion:** This lack of authorization allows any authenticated user, including those with Subscriber-level access or higher, to delete posts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Post Deletion:** An attacker with low-level access (Subscriber+) can delete posts including certificates, potentially causing loss of data or disrupting site functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely, as the vulnerable functionality is accessible through the web interface.
*   **Authenticated Users:** Any authenticated user with subscriber or higher level access can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the WordPress site with at least Subscriber-level privileges.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Action:** The attacker must be aware of the `llms_delete_cert` action.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was present in LifterLMS plugin versions up to and including 7.8.5.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 7.8.6 by adding the missing authorization check. The fix is visible in the provided Trac changeset by checking `current_user_can( 'manage_lifterlms' )`.
*   The `delete()` function was also updated with the same check as a secondary measure. This function was updated in the abstract controller class `llms-abstract-controller-user-engagements.php`
