The LifterLMS â€“ WP LMS for eLearning, Online Courses, & Quizzes plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary post deletion due to a missing capability check on the 'llms_delete_cert' action in all versions up to, and including, 7.8.5. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary posts.
