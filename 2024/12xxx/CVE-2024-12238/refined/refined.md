Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of user-supplied input within the `NF_Display_Preview` class of the Ninja Forms plugin. Specifically, the plugin uses the `do_shortcode` function to process a string containing user-provided form ID without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary Shortcode Execution:** The core issue is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary shortcodes. The `the_content()` function in `Preview.php` constructs a shortcode string with the provided form ID from the `$_GET['nf_preview_form']` parameter and passes this string to `do_shortcode()`.  Since the `$_GET['nf_preview_form']` value is not sufficiently sanitized before being included in the shortcode and executed, an attacker can inject their own shortcodes through this parameter.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** Although `WPN_Helper::sanitize_text_field()` is used to sanitize the input, this is not sufficient to prevent shortcode injection. The `sanitize_text_field` function is meant to prevent HTML injection, but does not prevent the execution of a shortcode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shortcodes, potentially leading to various malicious actions, such as:
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** By injecting shortcodes that modify user roles.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** By injecting shortcodes that expose sensitive data.
    *   **Website Defacement:** By injecting shortcodes that modify the site's appearance or content.
    *   **Remote Code Execution:** Through shortcodes that are plugins or themes which have remote code execution vulnerabilities, or by combining the shortcode execution with other vulnerabilities present on the site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL by manipulating the `nf_preview_form` parameter in the HTTP GET request to include the desired shortcode(s).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated WordPress user with at least "Subscriber" level access to exploit this vulnerability, as indicated by the description "Authenticated (Subscriber+)". This is because the `the_content()` function checks if the user is logged in.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects all versions of the Ninja Forms plugin up to and including 3.8.22.
*   **Patch:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.8.23 and later. The fix likely involves properly sanitizing the user-provided form ID or using a safer method to process the form preview functionality without invoking `do_shortcode()`.
*   The vulnerable code is found in the `includes/Display/Preview.php` file of the plugin. Specifically, the function `the_content()` on line 50 is the main point of vulnerability.
