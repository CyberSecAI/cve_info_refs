**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability in `login.php`

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass authentication and potentially gain unauthorized access to the application by injecting malicious SQL statements.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `email` field of the login form.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the login form and provide manipulated input to the `email` field.
