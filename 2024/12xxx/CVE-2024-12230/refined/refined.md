Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `/admin/subcategory.php` file of the "Complaint Management system" project.
*   The vulnerability arises because the application directly uses the `category` parameter in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input (`category` parameter) before using it in a database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
*   **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database.
*   **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database.
*   **Comprehensive System Control:** In severe cases, an attacker could potentially gain control over the system.
*   **Service Interruption:** Attackers could cause a denial of service by manipulating the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request targeting the `/admin/subcategory.php` file.
*   **Malicious `category` Parameter:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code via the `category` parameter in the POST data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **No Authentication Required**: The vulnerability can be exploited without any login or authorization.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable File:** `/admin/subcategory.php`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `category` (POST)
*   **Payload Example:** `category=1' AND (SELECT 7153 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))whkQ) AND 'yguz'='yguz&subcategory=111&submit=`
*   **Exploitation Tool:** The provided content references the use of `sqlmap` for exploitation.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Prepared Statements:** Use prepared statements with parameter binding to separate SQL code from user input.
*   **Input Validation:** Implement strict validation and filtering of user input.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant database users minimal necessary permissions.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
