## Version Information

### Component Versions

Distributed Engine and Advanced Session-Recording Agent: 8.4.39.0

Protocol Handler: 6.0.3.31

If your protocol handler version is 6.0.3.26 or lower, you must manually upgrade to a higher version. Automatic upgrades will not work for versions 6.0.3.26 or below. However, if your protocol handler version is 6.0.3.27 or higher, the automatic upgrade will function properly.
## Improvements

| 537407 | Improved: Sorting by a secret field for which there are no secrets now indicates such instead of just displaying an unknown column. |
| --- | --- |
| 541150 | Improved: When the Radius two-factor authentication login page loads for Secret Server, focus is now set to the password box, so you do not have to click it before typing. |

| 578682 | Improved: Inbox templates, rules, and resource grids converted to latest component grid. |
| 580088 | Improved: Azure Active Directory domains now use sync secrets yet remain backwards compatible for existing Azure Active Directory domains that still directly store the domain's client id, client secret, and tenant ID. |
| 580662 | Improved: Expanding the folder row in a secret grid informs the user inline if they lack access to see the folder owners instead of redirecting to a full access denied error page. |
| 582196 | Improved: Added a setting to redirect all users to log in through platform Platform integration settings. |
| 584486 | Improved: Removed case sensitivity from scriptable discovery lookup calls to find OUs for a computer. |
| 584579 | Improved: Site sorting is now in alphabetical order in dropdowns, lists, and more. |
| 584837 | Improved: Secret audits now have the ability to filter by audit action type via a multiselect filter. |

| 587667 | Improved: Secret Server custom URL is now being sent to Platform as an accepted redirect URL. |
| 588435 | Improved: Converted grids on three Automatic Export pages (Audit, Log and Storage) to thy-data-view for consistent look, feel, and functionality, such as allowing Notes field to be fully viewed in right panel on row click rather than via a tooltip. |

| 590073 | Improved: OU column is now available on Discovery Network view. |
| 590111 | Improved: Discovery log and computer scan logs filter updated to latest component for accessibility. |
| 590933 | Improved: Discovery now has full detail pages for Entra entities, and they also appear in the new larger panel. |

| 591933 | Improved: Search performance improved for typical users. |
| 592094 | Improved: Bulk sync now does one insert SQL for a list of users and not one per user. |
| 592264 | Improved: Added a precheck to ensure we don't try to migrate native/hybrid users that are missing their extended mapping, which likely would have resulted in strange duplication behavior |
| 592499 | Improved: Groups created in Platform now default to being set as "Migrated" for their migration state. |
| 592713 | Improved: Category list converted to latest grid component. |
| 592715 | Improved: Azure AD Domains now use sync secrets. As part of this, searching for a suitable secret template to serve as the sync secret must have Client Id, Client secret, and Tenant Id fields mapped for its secret type. This applies to the Azure App registration secret template out of the box. |
| 593909 | Improved: Attempting to log into an application account through the UI will no longer add a successful login audit event for that user. Successful and failed login attempts are still logged. |
| 595158 | Improved: Secret Server reports can now be saved as a shortcut on the Platform desktop. |
| 595573 | Improved: The opt-in step allows a user to add a new Platform tenant. It is the first step to integrate from Secret Server to Platform. This step is a part of the redesign of the Easy Move integration tool. |
| 595730 | Improved: The team-members list page has been updated for easier adding and removing of members. The entire domain inclusion option has been moved to the team general tab. |
| 595732 | Improved: Roles mapped to the "All Vault Users" group in Secret Server are now be mapped to the "Everybody" group in Platform after migration runs if the "All Vault Users" group is selected for that migration. |
| 595945 | Improved: Report list page heading is now semantically correct. |
| 595948 | Improved: Secret quick-access page heading is now semantically correct. |
| 596411 | Improved: Updated Platform migration prechecks by adding new information precheck type. |
| 596413 | Improved: QuantumLock audit grid updated to latest component. |
| 596695 | Improved: Updated BouncyCastle.Cryptography package to a non-vulnerable version. |
| 596927 | Improvement. Added the ability to prompt for site selection when launching an SSH session through a DE proxy. |
| 597484 | Improved: You can now pick values less than four hours in the minimum Platform sync configuration. |
| 597621 | Improved: When on prem has a cluster issue, the license pages are now accessible from any web node. |
| 599089 | Improved: A new user experience setting has been added called, "Separate Secret Audit for Comment." When this is true, a secret that requires comment will have an additional audit entry with an action of "Comment." This allows a secret to be commented on and checked out but not viewed. Without this setting the secret audit will show a "View" action with the comment text and then the checkout. Now you will see "Comment," "Checkout," and then "View" only once they have actually viewed the secret. |
| 599421 | Improved: Creating a new Active Directory discovery source is now full page instead of in a modal. |
| 599481 | Improved: ITDR Service Accounts are now handled via messaging in Secret Server. |

| 600137 | Improved: Platform users metadata replicates fully to a disaster recovery replica instance. |
| 600425 | Improved: Converted directory services domain audit to the new grid component. |
| 600639 | Improved: Converted the export-import settings audit page to thy-data-view. |
| 600664 | Improved: For Secret Server Cloud customers integrated with Platform, disabled the underlying "Create Groups During Synchronization" setting, which was previously able to be enabled, and already disabled for the vast majority of customers. This setting would automatically create domain groups during synchronization, which we now require to be specifically created. Platform Cloud groups are already automatically created and this behavior is unaffected. |
| 600797 | Improved: Converted the secret-erase list grids to the new grid component. |
| 601395 | Improved: Discovery pages are now accessible at /discovery instead of /admin/discovery. This change also decreases the pack size of the admin and discovery modules. |
| 601455 | Improved: The toggle expand and favorite star in the global right panel widget now properly have aria-labels, aria-controls, and aria-expanded tags. |
| 601456 | Improved: Service users created in Platform are now mapped to application accounts in Secret Server. |
| 601459 | Improved: ITDR account created via OAuth token or messaging from identity. |
| 602245 | Improved: Updates to the opt-in flow: Platform region field is now read only by default, and regionEditable=true|false query parameter is available to override the default. |
| 602371 | Improved: Added security hardening report and warnings to discourage or prevent password type changers that rely on JScape libraries due to security vulnerability. |
| 602443 | Improved: Users can now navigate to and from licenses page to clustering pages. |

| 603364 | Improved: A filter of object type was added to the log tab of the Platform integration center. |
| 603978 | Improved: Password changers grid now includes columns for can edit and Secret usage count. Some additional filters were also added. |
| 603980 | Improved: VaultBroker updating a URL requires a valid connection with the Secret Server instance before allowing updates. |
| 604471 | Improved: Added security hardening report and warnings to discourage/prevent password type changers that rely on JScape libraries due to security vulnerability. |
| 604568 | Improved: Updated UI to only make one call to the "enable unified mode" endpoint. |
| 609745 | Improved: Performance of launcher session cleanup |
| 609923 | Improved: Added a check to Platform configuration in Secret Server that prevents synchronization of Platform data (users, groups, roles, etc.) to Secret Server while migration from Secret Server to Platform is running. |

| 570798 | Fixed: In the SDK Client Management > Client Onboarding Page, when viewing a user with an onboarding key required, if the key is visible in the side panel and you select another user with a key required, the key that is shown now updates to be the key associated with the most recently selected user. |
| 571356 | Fixed: Event queue not clearing. Adjusted the location of and query of the EventQueue cleanup process. |
| 572635 | Fixed: RPC errors for SAP template secrets, which were occurring with SAP "systemuser" user types, even when using a privileged account. |

| 581752 | Fixed: Custom report names with double quotations in them no longer throw an error when downloading a report to a .csv and will download successfully. The .csv will not contain the quotations, but they will remain in the name on Secret Server. |
| 581802 | Fixed: Some edge cases related to Platform Federation could result in a group losing its members in Secret Server. |
| 585612 | Fixed: A duplicate role assignment during migration was fixed so that the migration matches what was in SS. |
| 586300 | Fixed: When a date is downloaded from a grid, it now properly formats according to the selected download date format. |
| 586526 | Fixed: Card and grid mode "last connected" field now shows the correct time and match. |

| 589245 | Fixed: When Secret Server was integrated with Platform and a federated user logs and connects to an AD user in Secret Server, the Platform sync could remove AD groups (from Secret Server AD Synchronization) because that was not a supported configuration. Now, we prevent the removal of AD groups from a Secret Server user during Platform synchronization if the connected Platform user source is Federation. Platform synchronization of groups when a Platform user source is Active Directory/connector and the Secret Server user is an Active Directory user will work as before. We are doing this as harm reduction until the configuration in Platform is set up to be compatible with supported scenarios. |
| 589332 | Fixed: Creating an access request with custom dates or times displayed an incorrect warning or had incorrect dates or times when approved. |
| 589821 | Fixed: Addressed a very rare edge case where a synchronized AD or Azure AD group flagged as "SynchronizeNow" that is also inactive could block synchronization from running indefinitely. |

| 591870 | Fixed: Migration work now considers users that have come from Platform (either Platform Native or Hybrid users) when migrating. It was indirectly ignoring them before under certain circumstances |
| 591954 | Fixed: Issue with connections remaining open with Windows local account RPC. |
| 592169 | Fixed: A duplicate group was created when Platform syncs back to SS after a group is migrated. |
| 592877 | Fixed: The product link for installing browser extensions led to the documentation home rather than the proper page. Clicking OK now takes you to <https://docs.delinea.com/online-help/secret-server/launcher-protocol-handler/launchers/procedures/web-launchers/wpf/index.htm?cshid=ChromeExtV2>. |

| 595556 | Fixed: Inbox breadcrumb was going to a 404 error and has been removed. |
| 595758 | Fixed: Secrets with checkout and require comment will now have a combined option in the secret grid options menu for a secret. You can configure these to be separate as prior to this release in admin/user experience. |
| 596124 | Fixed: In the SDK Client Management > Client Onboarding Page, when viewing a user with an onboarding key required, if the key is visible in the side panel and you select another user with a key required, the key that is shown now updates to be the key associated with the most recently selected user. |

| 598013 | Fixed: Addressed a case where URI's were compared before normalization and canonicalization potentially leading to over matching against the approved list. Added additional validation that the downloaded installer's batch file was in the expected format. |
| 598083 | Fixed: An issue where failed video conversions would not clean up temp files. |
| 599034 | Fixed: Resolved accessibility issues on workflow and custom SSH cipher suites. |
