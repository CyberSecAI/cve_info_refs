- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect default permissions on files and folders within the Evoko Home service installation on Windows. The 'Everyone' group has full control permissions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Weak file and folder permissions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Privilege escalation, arbitrary code execution, and persistence on the compromised machine. A non-admin user can leverage the excessive permissions to gain higher privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the operating system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A non-admin user must have local access to the system where Evoko Home is installed.
