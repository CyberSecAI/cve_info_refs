Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12072

**Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Software:** WordPress plugin "Analytics Cat â€“ Google Analytics Made Easy"

**Affected Versions:** All versions up to and including 1.1.2

**Root Cause:** The plugin uses `add_query_arg` without proper escaping when constructing URLs. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the URL parameters.

**Weaknesses:**
*   Improper input sanitization: The plugin fails to sanitize user-controlled input before using it in the construction of URLs.
*   Use of `add_query_arg` without escaping: The function `add_query_arg` is used to create URLs without properly sanitizing the arguments.

**Impact:**
*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser if the victim clicks on a specially crafted link.
*   This can lead to a variety of attacks, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting the user to a malicious website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript code in its query parameters.
*   An attacker would need to trick a user into clicking on the malicious link, for example via phishing or social engineering.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to perform this attack.
*   The attacker needs the ability to create and distribute a malicious URL.
*   The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking the crafted link.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.1.3 of the plugin by using `esc_url` to sanitize the output of `add_query_arg`.
* The vulnerable code is found in `includes/notices/notices.php`
* The fix was introduced in changeset [3202743](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3202743/analytics-cat)
