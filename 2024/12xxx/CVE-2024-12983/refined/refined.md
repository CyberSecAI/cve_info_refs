Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-12983:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `manage-doctors.php` file of a Hospital Management System written in PHP.
- The `doctorName` parameter, which is retrieved from a database, is directly echoed to the page without any filtering or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code via the `doctorName` parameter.
- This injected script will then be executed in the context of other users who access the `manage-doctors.php` page, leading to potential sensitive information disclosure, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `doctorName` parameter in the `manage-doctors.php` file.
- An attacker would need to inject malicious code into this parameter, which will then be stored in the database and displayed without sanitization.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to insert data into the `doctorName` field, which likely requires admin privileges in this application.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim, as the attack is stored and triggered when the vulnerable page is accessed by other users.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrating the vulnerability using a simple `<script>alert(1)</script>` payload.
- The content includes screenshots showing the injection point in the "Add New Doctor" form and the execution of the XSS payload.
- The github content references the source code for the hospital management system.
- The code-projects.org content is related to the source of the hospital management system.
