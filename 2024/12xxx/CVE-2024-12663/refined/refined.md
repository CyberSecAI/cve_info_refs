The provided content describes a user enumeration vulnerability in the `mee-admin` application, which is related to CVE-2024-12663, assuming the CVE is related to user enumeration or similar issues.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application returns different responses for login attempts with valid and invalid usernames. This discrepancy allows an attacker to distinguish between existing and non-existing users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- User enumeration vulnerability (CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can enumerate valid usernames.
- With knowledge of valid usernames, attackers can conduct targeted brute-force or credential-stuffing attacks, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.

**Attack vectors:**
- Submitting login attempts with different usernames via the `/mee/login` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to access the login page.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
