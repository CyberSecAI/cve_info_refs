- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization of the `$msg` parameter in `/include/lib/common.php`. Specifically, SQL error messages, which include user-controlled inputs, are not properly sanitized before being displayed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application reflects unsanitized user input in the error message, allowing for injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web application. When these scripts are executed in a victim's browser, the attacker can potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or redirect the user to a malicious site.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The vulnerability is triggered via HTTP POST requests to vulnerable endpoints, such as `/admin/navbar.php` and `/index.php`, by manipulating specific parameters (`naviname`, `url`, `comment`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints, and may require an administrator's cookie for some endpoints.
