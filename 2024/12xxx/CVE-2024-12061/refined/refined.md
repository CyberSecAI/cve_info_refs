Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control in the `naevents_elementor_template` shortcode within the Events Addon for Elementor plugin. This shortcode allows users to embed Elementor templates, but it did not properly restrict which posts could be included. This means that authenticated users, even those with Contributor-level access, could potentially access and extract data from private or draft posts that they were not intended to see.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authorization Bypass:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks when retrieving content via the shortcode.
*   **Information Exposure:** The vulnerability leads to the exposure of sensitive information from private or draft posts.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The plugin did not properly validate user input, allowing any post ID to be used in the shortcode.
* **Lack of Proper Post Status Checks:** The plugin failed to properly verify if a user had permission to view posts in draft or private statuses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can view content from private and draft posts. This can include sensitive information, event details, or any content not meant to be public.
*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Contributors can access content intended only for higher-level users, potentially leading to the exposure of sensitive data, or enabling them to copy and use the design of other posts.
*   **Privacy Breach:** This vulnerability could lead to privacy breaches and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Abuse:** Attackers can exploit the `naevents_elementor_template` shortcode by providing the ID of a private or draft post they want to access.
*   **WordPress Post IDs:** Attackers require knowledge of post IDs. This information can be obtained through enumeration or by creating and manipulating post content in the WordPress instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site with at least Contributor-level access.
*   **Knowledge of Post IDs:** The attacker must know the ID of the private or draft post they intend to access.
*   **Ability to Insert Shortcodes:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify posts to insert and execute the vulnerable shortcode.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in version 2.2.4 of the plugin.
*   The fix involved implementing proper permission checks and validating post statuses before displaying content.
* The fix includes checks for if a user is logged in and if a user has the `read_post` capability for the given ID.
* Additional checks were made to ensure the user had the required `edit_posts` capability to view private and draft posts, not including public ones.
* Elementor post type support was added to further ensure that the vulnerability is not exposed on non-elementor posts.
* Proper error handling was implemented to ensure that errors are not displayed to the end user.
