{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `papvfwc_views` shortcode.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation"
    ],

    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts through the attributes of the `papvfwc_views` shortcode.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have contributor-level access or higher to inject the malicious shortcode."
