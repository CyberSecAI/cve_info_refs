Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-12369:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the way the `elytron-oidc-client` handles authorization codes during the OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication process. Specifically, the client does not adequately verify or protect against the substitution of authorization codes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authorization Code Injection:** An attacker can inject a stolen authorization code into their own authentication flow.
- **Lack of Sufficient Validation:** The client does not properly validate the origin or legitimacy of the authorization code, allowing it to be swapped with a stolen one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Identity Spoofing:** An attacker can hijack a legitimate user's session by injecting their stolen authorization code, effectively assuming the victim's identity within the application.
- **Unauthorized Access:** The attacker can gain access to the application with the victim's privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker could intercept the authorization code during a legitimate user's authentication flow.
- **Phishing:** An attacker could trick a user into providing their authorization code through a phishing attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Code Acquisition:** The attacker needs to obtain a valid authorization code from a legitimate user's authentication process.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept or modify the request/response flow during authentication.
- **Active Session:** The attacker needs to initiate the login flow to inject the code during authentication.
- **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of the authentication flow and the vulnerability itself to inject the code properly.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Red Hat SSO OIDC adapter with EAP 7.x and `elytron-oidc-client` subsystem with EAP 8.x.
- The attacker replaces a newly generated authorization code with the stolen one during the authorization exchange.
- The OIDC provider performs its checks successfully and issue tokens associated with the victim to the attacker.
