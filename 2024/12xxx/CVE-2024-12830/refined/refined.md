- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path within the `custom_handler` method before using it in file operations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Directory traversal vulnerability, allowing arbitrary file operations.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the `www-data` user.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote, unauthenticated access to the vulnerable `custom_handler` method.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Arista NG Firewall and the ability to send requests to the application. No authentication is required.
