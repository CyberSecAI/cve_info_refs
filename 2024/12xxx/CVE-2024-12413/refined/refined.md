**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from missing authorization checks in the "MarketKing â€” Ultimate WooCommerce Multivendor Marketplace Solution" plugin for WordPress. Several functions within the plugin lack proper capability checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization Checks:** The primary weakness is the absence of adequate checks to ensure that only authorized users can execute certain functions. This includes actions like deleting team members, rejecting users, saving profile settings, and potentially other administrative operations.
*   Specifically, functions 'marketking_delete_team_member', 'marketkingrejectuser', 'marketking_save_profile_settings' and many others lacked capability checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
