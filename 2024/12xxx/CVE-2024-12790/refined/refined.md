Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and encoding in the `book-hostel.php` file. Data submitted through POST requests is directly inserted into the `registration` database table without any validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into database fields.
*   The `room-details.php` file then renders the unsanitized data stored in the database leading to the XSS vulnerability when a user views the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected through form fields in `book-hostel.php`, stored in the database, and then executed when a user views the `room-details.php` page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Theft:** Attackers can use the XSS vulnerability to steal sensitive information such as cookies, session tokens, and other data available to the user's browser.
*   **Account Takeover:** If session tokens are stolen, an attacker can potentially hijack user accounts.
*   **Malware Distribution:** The injected script could redirect users to malicious websites or trick them into downloading malware.
*   **Website Defacement:** The attacker could modify the content of the affected page, leading to website defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request to `book-hostel.php`:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious POST request to `book-hostel.php` with XSS payloads injected into various form fields (e.g., pcity, paddress).
*  **Viewing `room-details.php`:** When a user visits the `room-details.php` page, the stored malicious script will be executed by the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to submit data to the `book-hostel.php` form.
*   The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to submit the malicious data.
*   The attacker does not need direct access to the server or database.

**Additional Details:**

* The provided content includes example payloads and screenshots demonstrating the vulnerability.
* The vulnerable parameters mentioned are `pcity` and `paddress`, but it is implied that other parameters may also be vulnerable since all POST parameters are inserted directly into the database.
*   The code analysis shows how the form data is inserted into the database using prepared statements; however, the data is not sanitized before the insert operation.
* The `mysqli->prepare` and `bind_param` used in the PHP code are related to prepared statements but do not prevent XSS. They prevent SQL injection, a different type of vulnerability. The issue is the lack of sanitization or encoding of the data before it is inserted into the database.

**Summary**
The content describes a stored XSS vulnerability in a hostel management system due to the lack of input sanitization of user-provided data before storing it in the database.
