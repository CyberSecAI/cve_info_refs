### Summary:
The provided content describes a vulnerability in the Animation Addons for Elementor WordPress plugin, specifically versions 1.1.6 and earlier. This vulnerability allows authenticated users with Contributor-level access or higher to extract sensitive information from Elementor templates through the Content Slider and Tabs widgets.

### Root Cause of Vulnerability:
The vulnerability stems from the `render` function within the `widgets/content-slider.php` and `widgets/tabs.php` files. These functions, when rendering Elementor templates, did not check if the templates were publicly accessible (published), allowing users to access private, pending, and draft templates.

### Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The plugin exposes potentially sensitive data of Elementor templates.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The plugin lacks proper access control checks for template visibility, allowing contributors and higher-level users to bypass restrictions on accessing unpublished templates.

### Impact of Exploitation:
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in:
- **Data Leakage:** Attackers can access private content, including drafts and pending posts/pages, potentially containing sensitive or confidential information.
- **Unintended Disclosure:** Exposure of unfinished content, which may not be ready for public consumption.

### Attack Vectors:
The attack vector involves manipulating the `render` function of the Content Slider and Tabs widgets. This can be done by an attacker with an account that has at least Contributor level access. They can then insert an Elementor template into the widget and access the template data even if it's unpublished.

### Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site.
- **Contributor Level Access or Higher:** The attacker's user role must be Contributor or higher to exploit this vulnerability.
