The Animation Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.6 via the 'render' function in widgets/content-slider.php and widgets/tabs.php. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract sensitive private, pending, and draft Elementor template data.
