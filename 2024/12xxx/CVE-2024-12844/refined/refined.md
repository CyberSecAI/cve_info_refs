Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability is insufficient input validation and sanitization in emlog pro 2.4.1. Parameters from HTTP requests are directly included into the HTML output without proper sanitization. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are present in multiple files:
    - `/admin/tag.php`
    - `/admin/user.php`
    - `/admin/plugin.php`
    - `/admin/store.php`
- The vulnerabilities are due to improper handling of parameters such as `keyword`, `filter`, and `tag`. These are directly concatenated into the HTML output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- If an administrator accesses a malicious URL crafted by an attacker, the injected script will execute in the administrator's browser.
- This could allow the attacker to obtain the administrator's session cookies.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted URLs containing malicious JavaScript payloads injected into parameters of vulnerable php files.
- Specifically, the vulnerable parameters are `keyword`, `filter`, and `tag` in the above mentioned files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft URLs with malicious JavaScript payloads.
- The attacker needs to trick an administrator to click the malicious URL.

**Technical Details:**
- The attacker injects payloads such as:
   - `1"><svg onload=alert(document.cookie)>`
   - `1"></script><svg onload=alert(document.cookie)>`

The provided Proof of Concept (POC) URLs are:
   - `http://target-ip/admin/tag.php?keyword=1%22%3E%3Csvg%20onload=alert(document.cookie)%3E`
   - `http://target-ip/admin/user.php?keyword=1%22%3E%3Csvg%20onload=alert(document.cookie)%3E`
   - `http://target-ip/admin/plugin.php?filter=1%22%3E%3C/script%3E%3Csvg%20onload=alert(document.cookie)%3E`
   - `http://target-ip/admin/store.php?tag=1%22%3E%3Csvg%20onload=alert(document.cookie)%3E`
   - `http://target-ip/admin/store.php?keyword=1%22%3E%3Csvg%20onload=alert(document.cookie)%3E`
