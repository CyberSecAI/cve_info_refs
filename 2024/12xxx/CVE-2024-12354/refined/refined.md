The provided content relates to CVE-2024-12354.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to improper input validation in the `UserInterface::MenuDisplayStart()` function of the Phone Contact Manager System. The program uses `std::cin >> choice` to parse user input into an integer variable `choice`, but it doesn't validate the length or range of the input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Lack of input validation:** The program does not check if the input is within the expected range of menu options or if the input string is too long.
- **Integer truncation:** When a very long number is entered, `std::cin >> choice` truncates it to the maximum value of an `int` (2147483647) without any error handling.
- **Infinite loop:** The main loop in `Phone Contact Manager System.cpp` does not handle the case where `choice` has an unexpected value (such as the maximum `int` value), leading to an infinite loop.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Program Logic Errors:** An excessively long input causes the program to enter an infinite loop repeatedly displaying the main menu due to the unhandled value of choice.
- **Resource Consumption:** The infinite loop leads to high CPU usage, which impacts overall system performance by continuously executing the same code without any meaningful operation.
- **User Experience Issues:** The program does not provide any feedback for invalid input, making it unusable.

**Attack vectors:**
- User inputting an excessively long number when prompted to make a menu selection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the program's menu input (i.e., have local or remote access to the program's execution environment).
