Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The `online-exam-mastering-system-php` application does not properly sanitize user input before displaying it on the webpage. Specifically, the `nome` parameter in `sign.php` and `account.php` is vulnerable. The application retrieves data from the database and directly echoes it out without filtering, allowing execution of injected XSS scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Lack of input sanitization/validation: The application fails to sanitize or encode user-supplied data before rendering it in the HTML output.
- Direct database to output: Data fetched from the database is directly outputted without proper context-aware escaping, allowing for script injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.
- Stealing of sensitive information (e.g., session cookies, authentication tokens)
- Website defacement
- Redirection to malicious websites

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious users can inject JavaScript code through the `name` parameter in the `sign.php` and `account.php` forms.
- The injected script will be executed when the vulnerable page is rendered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to submit a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable `sign.php` page or by accessing `account.php` if the malicious payload was already saved in the database.
- No prior authentication is mentioned as a requirement.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the application.

**Payload Example:**
```
POST /sign.php?q=account.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.143
Content-Length: 129
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Accept-Language: en-US

Origin: http://192.168.0.143
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

name=%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C%2Fscript%3E&gender=M&college=aaa&email=aaa%40aaa.com&mob=123456&password=123456&cpassword=123456
```
This payload injects a simple JavaScript `alert(1)` which will be executed in the victim's browser demonstrating the XSS.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable parameter is described as "nome" parameter in the description but the payload example uses "name" parameter. It is likely the description has a typo.
- The vulnerability is present in both `sign.php` and `account.php` scripts.
- The provided example uses a local IP address `192.168.0.143` as the host for the application, but this would be the server's actual IP address when deployed.
