- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation and sanitization of user-supplied parameters in multiple PHP files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. The parameters `keyword` in `/admin/tag.php`, `/admin/user.php`, `tag` and `keyword` in `/admin/store.php`, and `filter` in `/admin/plugin.php` are not properly sanitized before being concatenated into the HTML output.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into web pages, which are then executed in the browsers of other users (administrators). This can lead to the attacker obtaining session cookies and potentially gaining unauthorized access to the system.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting malicious URLs containing JavaScript payloads and tricking a user (e.g., an administrator) into accessing them.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs with the XSS payloads. They need to trick the administrator into visiting the crafted malicious URLs.
