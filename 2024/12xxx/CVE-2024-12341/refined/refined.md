- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing capability check on the `cf7cs_action_callback` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing authorization leading to arbitrary post update and skin creation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access or higher can modify the content of any post and create new skins.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based. An authenticated attacker sends a crafted request to the vulnerable function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least subscriber-level access to the WordPress site.
