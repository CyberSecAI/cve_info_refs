The Custom Skins Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'cf7cs_action_callback' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update the content of any post and create new skins.
