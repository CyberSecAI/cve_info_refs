The provided content is related to CVE-2024-12947.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper input sanitization of the `dname` parameter in the `/invo.php` file. User-supplied input is directly used in SQL queries without proper validation or cleaning.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in `/invo.php`
- Insufficient user input validation for `dname` parameter

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized database access
- Sensitive data leakage
- Data tampering
- Comprehensive system control
- Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/invo.php`
- Exploitation of the `dname` parameter

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No login or authentication required
- Ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint
- Ability to inject malicious SQL code into the `dname` parameter
- Basic understanding of SQL injection techniques

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is a boolean-based blind SQL injection.
- The attacker can use time-based blind techniques (e.g., `SLEEP()`) to infer information.
- The provided PoC uses `sqlmap` to demonstrate exploitation.
- The attacker can retrieve databases information.
- The provided payload `pname=111&dname=111' AND (SELECT 2655 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))mwzM) AND 'jeJf'='jeJf&age=111&mc=11&dc=111&submit=SUBMIT` can be used for exploitation.
- Screenshots from SQLMap show successful exploitation.
- The suggested fixes are using prepared statements, input validation, minimal database user permissions and regular security audits.
