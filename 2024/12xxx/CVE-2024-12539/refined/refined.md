- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper authorization controls in Elasticsearch allowed certain queries to bypass Document Level Security.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inadequate authorization checks leading to the circumvention of Document Level Security.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could gain access to documents that their roles should not normally allow them to view.
- **Attack vectors:** Malicious queries crafted to exploit the authorization flaw.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user with some level of access to Elasticsearch and the ability to construct specific queries. The attacker must have privileges to perform queries in the system.
