The provided content is related to a commit that fixes a SQL injection vulnerability, as indicated by the commit message "fix(acesso.php e checkflag.php): SQL Injection".

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the direct inclusion of user-supplied input into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. Specifically, the `acesso.php` and `checkflag.php` files were vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The original code in `acesso.php` used string concatenation to build SQL queries, making it vulnerable to SQL injection. The `$usuario` variable was directly inserted into the SQL query: `$sql = "SELECT * FROM Usuario where id='$usuario'";`
-  Similarly, `checkflag.php` was vulnerable due to the `$problema` variable being directly inserted into SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially bypass authentication, retrieve sensitive data, modify database records, or execute arbitrary SQL commands.
- In `acesso.php`, an attacker could bypass the user id check to access other user's data.
- In `checkflag.php`, an attacker could potentially manipulate database records related to the challenges.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to the `acesso.php` and `checkflag.php` files, by manipulating the `usuario` and `problema` parameters respectively.
- An attacker could inject malicious SQL code within the `usuario` and `problema` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `acesso.php` and `checkflag.php` endpoints.
- They would need knowledge of the application's structure, specifically the vulnerable parameters to target in the injection attack.

**Mitigation:**
- The commit mitigates the vulnerability by using prepared statements with bound parameters.
- In `acesso.php`, the SQL query is changed to `$sql = "SELECT * FROM Usuario where id=:usuario";` and the parameter is bound to the statement.
-  The code uses `filter_input` with `FILTER_SANITIZE_NUMBER_INT` to sanitize input before it is used, although this is not sufficient to prevent SQL Injection as input is still used in the SQL query.
-  The code is improved to use a prepared statement to prevent SQL injection.
- The commit addresses the SQL injection vulnerabilities present in `acesso.php` and `checkflag.php` by sanitizing input and using parameterized queries in `acesso.php`.
