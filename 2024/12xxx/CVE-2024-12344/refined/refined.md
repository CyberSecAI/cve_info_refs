    "cve_id": "CVE-2024-12344",
    "description": "A buffer overflow and memory corruption vulnerability was found in VN020-F3v(T) router. It’s part of TP-Link’s custom firmware, built for ISPs but running on the same base firmware with tweaks for specific markets. This model is super common in countries like Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco—and it’s still being actively sold.\n\nThe vulnerability comes from how the router handles certain FTP payloads mainly, allowing an attacker to crash the router with a specially crafted payload or cause memory corruption and open doors for potential exploitation.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from improper handling of user input within TP-Link's FTP server. Specifically, the server fails to validate the length of the username provided during the login process.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Buffer Allocation: Allocates insufficient memory for handling large USER inputs.",
      "Lack of Input Validation: Fails to enforce maximum length constraints on the USER command.",
      "Memory Management Errors: Uses unsafe functions most likely",
      "Resource Constraints: Limited router memory and environment most likely also are a contributor to this"
    ],
     "impact": "Immediate Router Crash, Memory corruption, Persistent effects post exploitation",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "FTP USER Command"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "No authentication is required for the buffer overflow, single authentication is required for memory corruption, low complexity, no user interaction is required"
