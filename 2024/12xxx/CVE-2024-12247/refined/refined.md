The provided content is a webpage from mattermost.com that displays security updates for their platform. However, it does not contain information about any specific vulnerability or CVE. It mainly describes the process of reporting security issues, Mattermost's security review procedures, and their policy of disclosing security updates 30 days after they are released. There is a table for listing security updates, but it is empty in the provided content.

Therefore, I will respond with:
