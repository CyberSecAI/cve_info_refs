- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the parsing of STP files, leading to a type confusion condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Type confusion vulnerability due to improper validation of user-supplied data when parsing STP files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation requires user interaction, either through visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file. The vulnerability lies in the parsing of STP files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers need to be able to craft malicious STP files or malicious web pages. The user has to interact with the crafted input.
