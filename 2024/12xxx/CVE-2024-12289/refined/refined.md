- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An internal error in how the Boundary controller handles HTTP requests during its initialization phase. Normally, requests during this phase should be dropped, but due to the error, they are returned to the server as an error, leading to premature termination.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect handling of HTTP requests during the Boundary controller initialization. Specifically, requests that should be dropped are instead processed, leading to an error and potential termination of the Boundary server.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause a denial of service by sending HTTP requests during the Boundary controller's initialization, causing the server to terminate prematurely.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending HTTP requests to the Boundary controller during its initialization phase.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Boundary controller during the short initialization window, which typically lasts for milliseconds during the Boundary startup process.
