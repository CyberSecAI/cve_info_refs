The Broken Link Checker | Finder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Blind Server-Side Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.0 via the 'moblc_check_link' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application and can be used to query and modify information from internal services.
