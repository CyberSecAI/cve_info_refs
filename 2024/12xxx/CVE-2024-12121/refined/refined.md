Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12121

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the insecure use of the `wp_remote_head` function in the 'moblc_check_link' function. This function was replaced with `wp_safe_remote_head` in the patched version, indicating the original use did not properly sanitize URLs, allowing for the possibility of making requests to arbitrary locations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The plugin makes external requests to URLs provided by the user through the `moblc_check_link` function without proper sanitization. This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to force the server to make requests to arbitrary URLs. This is a blind SSRF, meaning the attacker does not receive the response from the server in most cases, but can still use the server as a proxy.
*   **Insecure use of `wp_remote_head`:** The plugin uses `wp_remote_head` without proper sanitization which leads to the SSRF vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Internal Service Access:** An attacker can exploit the SSRF to make requests to internal services that are not accessible from the outside, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or modifying data.
*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker could potentially overwhelm internal services with requests via the vulnerable plugin.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack is triggered via the `moblc_check_link` function which is accessible to users with Author or higher roles in the WordPress system.
*   The attacker must be authenticated and have at least Author level privileges.
*   The attacker manipulates the link input provided to the vulnerable function to point to internal or external targets of their choice.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must have a valid account on the WordPress site with at least Author-level privileges.
*   The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the URL passed to the plugin in the vulnerable function.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.5.1 of the plugin. The patch replaces all instances of  `wp_remote_head` with `wp_safe_remote_head`.
*   The vulnerability is described as a "blind SSRF" because the attacker typically doesn't receive the full response from the server, but can still leverage the server to perform actions.
* The vulnerable function is `moblc_check_link`.
