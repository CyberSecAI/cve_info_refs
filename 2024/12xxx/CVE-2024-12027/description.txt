The Message Filter for Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the updateFilter() and deleteFilter() functions in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to update and delete filters.
