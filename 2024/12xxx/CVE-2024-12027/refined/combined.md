### Description

The Message Filter for Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the updateFilter() and deleteFilter() functions in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to update and delete filters.

### [Almost completely SPAM-free now!](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/still-the-best-41/)

The Lite version worked great for keeping out most of the SPAM, phishing, and other breaches to our inbox. But I upgraded to the Pro version to block some additional SPAM that had started hitting us hard. I was getting emails from gmail and other accounts that had a lot of periods in the username area, like h.e.l.l.o.k.i.t.t.y@gmail.com. I added .a. .b. .c. and so on to the filter, and it is now blocking them quite efficiently. Thank you for creating this filter for CF7! It works great, easy to use, and the price for the Pro Version is great!

Been building sites with cf7 for 4 years, and recaptcha gets only part of the job done, honey pot gets only part of it done, and hcaptcha (for me) was a disaster because legit lead forms weren’t getting through. I was at a loss as to how to fill the gap. 95% of my spam still getting through was coming from digital marketers, and I wondered — why isn’t there a simple plugin that would filter out lead forms based on certain keywords? This plugin for some reason was hard to find, but fits the bill.
I’m honestly surprised it doesn’t have at least a million users. If those using CF7 knew about it… it would. Honestly a no-brainer, one of those that is such common sense that you feel stupid you didn’t think of a lot earlier.
Has lots of potential.
