The WP BASE Booking of Appointments, Services and Events plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the export_db function in all versions up to, and including, 4.9.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to expose sensitive information from the database, such as the hashed administrator password.
