Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12180

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient filtering of the `body` parameter in the `/member/article_add.php` script within DedeCMS v5.7.116.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- The application fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input (specifically the `body` parameter).
- The system only filters the keyword `script` but does not prevent other malicious injection techniques.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into articles.
- These injected scripts can be executed when other users view the compromised articles.
- Potential consequences include:
    - Stealing cookies.
    - Capturing keystrokes.
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    - Overall compromise of the website and its users' security.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- Attackers can register as members and then publish articles containing malicious scripts.
- The attack occurs through the `/member/article_add.php` script via an HTTP POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to register as a member on the vulnerable DedeCMS instance.
- Ability to craft and send HTTP POST requests containing malicious JavaScript in the `body` parameter.
- Basic understanding of web requests and XSS techniques is required.
- No specific user interaction is required other than viewing the compromised article.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is classified as "moderate severity" with a CVSS v4 score of 5.3.
- An EPSS score of 0.066% indicates a relatively low probability of exploitation.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to inject a basic script using the `body` parameter.
