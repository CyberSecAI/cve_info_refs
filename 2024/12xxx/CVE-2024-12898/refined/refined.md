Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-12898

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `/admin/faculty_action.php` file of the "Attendance Tracking Management System PHP & MySQL Project" version 1.0.
- The vulnerability occurs because the `faculty_course_id` parameter, sent via a multipart form, is directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where an attacker can insert malicious SQL code into the `faculty_course_id` parameter.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The system fails to validate and sanitize user-supplied input before using it in database queries, allowing malicious SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database.
- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data.
- **Comprehensive System Control:** In severe cases, attackers could gain complete control over the system.
- **Service Interruption:** Attackers could potentially disrupt the service by manipulating the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the `/admin/faculty_action.php` file.
- **`faculty_course_id` Parameter:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `faculty_course_id` parameter within the multipart form data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Login Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring prior login or authorization.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable web application.
- **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP POST requests with the malicious SQL payload in the `faculty_course_id` parameter.

**Technical Details:**

- The provided payload is a time-based blind SQL injection payload:

```
- The SQL injection payload `1" AND (SELECT 2945 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))aoZQ)-- LLPZ` attempts to cause a 5-second delay if the injection is successful (time-based blind).
- The `sqlmap` tool was used to verify and identify the vulnerability, as shown in the screenshots.

**Suggested Repairs:**
- **Prepared Statements:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. This method separates the SQL code from the user-provided data.
- **Input Validation and Filtering:** Implement strict validation and filtering of user-supplied input data to ensure they conform to the expected format.
- **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure the database user account used by the application has minimal permissions, avoiding high-privilege accounts like 'root' or 'admin'.
- **Regular Security Audits:** Regularly audit the code and system for potential security vulnerabilities.
