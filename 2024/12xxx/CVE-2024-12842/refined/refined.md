- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation and sanitization of parameters in multiple PHP files. Specifically, the `keyword` parameter in `/admin/tag.php` and `/admin/user.php`, the `filter` parameter in `/admin/plugin.php`, and the `tag` and `keyword` parameters in `/admin/store.php` are directly concatenated into the HTML output without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation**: If an administrator accesses a malicious URL crafted with the injected scripts, the attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the administrator's browser. This can lead to session hijacking and cookie theft.
- **Attack vectors**: Malicious URLs with crafted payloads.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with JavaScript payloads embedded in the vulnerable parameters. The attacker needs to trick an administrator into clicking the link.
