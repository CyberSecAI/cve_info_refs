You’ll need XAMP Server or WAMP Server. Put the file inside “c:/wamp/www/” or “c:/xampp/htdocs/”. Go To “localhost/phpmyadmin” in any browser and create Database naming “travel” (no capital letters). Then, in that Database, Import the SQL file (travel.sql) which is inside the database Folder of the project file and finally go to URL: “http://localhost/file\_name/phpfilename”

which server do you use -XAMPP or WAMP?

anyways Just Follow These Steps Below to Run: You’ll need XAMP Server or WAMP Server. Put the file inside “c:/wamp/www/” or “c:/xampp/htdocs/”. Go To “localhost/phpmyadmin” in any browser and create Database naming “travel” (no capital letters). Then, in that Database, Import the SQL file (travel.sql) which is inside the database Folder of the project file and finally go to URL: “http://localhost/file\_name/phpfilename”

.. and if it still doesn’t work then leave your Mail here we’ll send you complete Project Installation guide
