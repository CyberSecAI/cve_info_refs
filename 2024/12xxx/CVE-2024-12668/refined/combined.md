This commit was created on GitHub.com and signed with GitHub’s **verified signature**.

GPG key ID: B5690EEEBB952194

[Learn about vigilant mode](https://docs.github.com/github/authenticating-to-github/displaying-verification-statuses-for-all-of-your-commits).

This is a pre-release for testing of the latest WinPmem 4.1.

In this release the driver is test signed so to test you will need to enable test signing on:

1. As admin run `bcdedit /set testsigning on`
2. Reboot
3. Use the minitool
4. To revert use `bcdedit /set testsigning off`

PS: Dbgprint is set verbose, you can use dbgview.exe from Microsoft Sysinternals to see all of it (check 'kernel capture' in the menu)
