Infinix devices contain a pre-loaded "com.rlk.weathers" application, that exposes an unsecured content provider. An attacker can communicate with the provider and reveal the user’s location without any privileges. 
After multiple attempts to contact the vendor we did not receive any answer. We suppose this issue affects all Infinix Mobile devices.
