Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `activate()` and `deactivate()` functions within the `class-ajax.php` file of the Gold Addons for Elementor WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin fails to verify if the user has the necessary capabilities before allowing them to activate or deactivate a license.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Authorization Check:** The primary weakness is the absence of a capability check before executing the `activate()` and `deactivate()` functions. This allows any authenticated user, including those with minimal privileges (like Subscriber), to trigger these functions.
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The functions directly operate on the plugin's license without proper permission verification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **License Manipulation:** An attacker with Subscriber-level access can activate or deactivate the plugin license. This could potentially lead to:
   - **Disruption of Service:** Deactivating a license could disable premium features of the plugin for legitimate users.
   - **Unauthorized Access:** Activating a license with a stolen or unauthorized key.
   - **Financial Loss:** By deactivating a license, an attacker can disrupt the legitimate use of the plugin and the developer may suffer financial losses from sales.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited over the network via HTTP requests targeting the WordPress AJAX actions: `wp_ajax_gold_addons_activate` and `wp_ajax_gold_addons_deactivate`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the WordPress site.
- **Privilege:** The attacker needs at least Subscriber-level access, which is the lowest level of user access in WordPress.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in all versions of the plugin up to and including version 1.3.2.
- The vulnerable code is located in the `includes/admin/class-ajax.php` file within the plugin's directory.
- The provided code snippet from `plugins.trac.wordpress.org` confirms the lack of capability checks within the `activate` and `deactivate` functions.
