Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `get_legacy_cookies` function in the Last Viewed Posts plugin. This function retrieves and processes data from a legacy cookie (`WP-LastViewedPosts`), which stores IDs of recently viewed posts. This data is then used to extract post information, including titles and permalinks. The issue is that the function doesn't properly check the post status before extracting information, leading to the exposure of sensitive data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The plugin exposes titles and permalinks of private, password-protected, pending, and draft posts to unauthenticated users.
-   **Improper Access Control:** The `get_legacy_cookies` function does not enforce access controls, allowing unauthorized access to post information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gather information about unpublished or restricted content on the WordPress site, potentially gaining insights into upcoming content, internal communications, or sensitive data that was not intended for public view.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
-   Attackers can trigger the vulnerable code by accessing a page on the target website, which will run the plugin's code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be logged into the WordPress site to exploit the vulnerability.
-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.
-   **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not need any administrative or user privileges on the target website.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions 1.0.1 and earlier of the plugin.
- The plugin maintainers have released version 1.0.2 to address this vulnerability by removing the legacy cookie functionality.
- The vulnerable code is located within the `inc/namespace.php` file, specifically the `get_legacy_cookies` function.
- The fix involved removing the legacy cookie-related code.
