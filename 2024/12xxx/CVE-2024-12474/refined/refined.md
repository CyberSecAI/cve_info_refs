Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-12474:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the 'gds-country-dropdown' shortcode of the GeoDataSource Country Region DropDown plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin does not properly sanitize or escape user-provided input when rendering the shortcode's output. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code. This malicious code is stored in the database and executed when a user visits the page containing the vulnerable shortcode.
- **Compromise of user accounts:** Exploitation could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, and other malicious actions targeting site visitors or administrators, including potential redirection to phishing pages.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Shortcode Attribute Injection:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into the `default` attribute of the `gds-country-dropdown` shortcode.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated user:** Attackers need to be logged into the WordPress site with at least "contributor" level access or higher to add the malicious shortcode to pages.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was addressed in version 1.0.2 of the plugin by implementing sanitization and output escaping using `sanitize_text_field()` and `esc_js()`
- The vulnerable code snippet is present in `geodatasource-country-region-dropdown.php` within the `gds_country_dropdown` and `gds_country_handler` functions.
- The fix involved wrapping the `$a["default"]` and `$default` variables passed into the `country-data-default-value` attribute inside the mentioned escaping and sanitization functions.
