{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `JobInfoController.java` in versions of Xxl-job up to 2.4.1 directly sends requests to addresses specified in the `addressList` parameter of the `/trigger` endpoint without proper validation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "A low-privileged user can exploit the SSRF vulnerability by providing a malicious address in the `addressList` parameter. This allows the attacker to obtain the `XXL-JOB-ACCESS-TOKEN` and use it to execute arbitrary commands on any executor controlled by the platform.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker sends a POST request to the `/xxl-job-admin/jobinfo/trigger` endpoint with a crafted `addressList` parameter pointing to an attacker-controlled server."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "A regular user account on the XXL-JOB platform",
      "Knowledge of a valid JobId (which can be obtained through traversal)",
      "Ability to send HTTP requests"
    ],
	"additional_information": "The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2022-43183. The fix has been pushed to the master branch and will be included in a future 2.4.1 release, however users report the vulnerability still existing in the 2.4.1 release."
