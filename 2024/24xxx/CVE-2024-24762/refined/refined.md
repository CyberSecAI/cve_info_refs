  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `python-multipart` library uses a regular expression to parse the `Content-Type` header, which is vulnerable to ReDoS attacks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The regex used for parsing `Content-Type` headers is inefficient and can lead to denial of service attacks.",
      "The library does not properly handle maliciously crafted `Content-Type` headers."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a specially crafted `Content-Type` header that makes the regex parsing engine consume excessive CPU resources and stall indefinitely, preventing the server from processing further requests.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker can send a POST request with a crafted `Content-Type` header when the server is parsing form data using the vulnerable library.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server. No specific privileges or user interactions are required. The attacker needs to craft a malicious `Content-Type` header with a large number of backslashes."
