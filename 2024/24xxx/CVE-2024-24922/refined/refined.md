- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application contains an out-of-bounds write vulnerability due to improper parsing of a specially crafted Catia MODEL file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by opening a malicious Catia MODEL file using the Simcenter Femap application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious file with the vulnerable software.
