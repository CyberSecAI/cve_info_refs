Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application lacks proper sanitization of user-supplied input. Specifically, the `config.description` parameter in the `/admin/system/saveinfo.do` endpoint is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS due to improper handling of user input within the `config.description` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when the affected page (`/about/us.html`) is visited.
*   This could allow an attacker to steal session cookies, redirect the user to a malicious site, perform actions on behalf of the victim, or deface the website.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack is carried out via a crafted HTTP POST request to `/admin/system/saveinfo.do`. This request contains malicious JavaScript code within the `config.description` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to make a POST request to the `/admin/system/saveinfo.do` endpoint. This implies they need to be able to access the admin interface of the application and modify the system settings.
*   No additional information about necessary privileges was provided.
*   The attacker has to induce a victim to visit a page that displays the saved configuration, triggering the XSS. The demonstrated proof of concept uses `/about/us.html`.

**Technical details:**
*   The vulnerability was demonstrated by inserting the following payload into the `config.description` parameter:  `"><img src=1 onerror=alert(/xss/)>`
* The vulnerable code saves the `config.description` value, and later renders it unsanitized when the `/about/us.html` page is visited.
*   The application is identified as "MRCMS 3.0".
