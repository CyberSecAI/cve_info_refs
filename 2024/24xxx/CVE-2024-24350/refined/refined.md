Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient file extension validation during the upload process. The application only checks the `Content-Type` (MIME type) of the uploaded file, instead of its extension. This allows an attacker to bypass security checks by providing a file with an allowed MIME type but a malicious file extension (e.g., a PHP file disguised as a PDF or JPEG).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application allows users to upload files with potentially dangerous extensions, as long as the MIME type matches the allowed values, which bypasses any intended security measures.
*   **MIME type validation bypass:** The application validates only the mime type instead of the file extension
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious file (e.g., PHP file) and executing it, an attacker can gain control of the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application. This may lead to:
    *   Complete compromise of the server and application
    *   Data breaches
    *   Malware deployment

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **File Upload:** The vulnerability is triggered through a file upload form located at `/solicitacao/upload.php`.
*   **MIME type manipulation:** The attacker must set the `Content-Type` header in the upload request to an allowed value (e.g., `application/pdf`, `image/jpeg`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the application, as this vulnerability is authenticated. However, the medium post mentions that creating a user is straightforward by accessing `/cadastro/`.
*   **Access to file upload form:** The attacker needs to be able to access the file upload functionality at `/solicitacao/`.
*   **Understanding of the file upload path:** The attacker needs to know where the files are uploaded to in order to execute them after they are uploaded to the server.

**Additional Information:**

*   The affected product is e-Sic Livre version 2.0 and before.
*   The vulnerability is present in the file upload functionality at `/solicitacao/upload.php`.
*   The application stores the file upload path in the database, and it might be necessary to adjust the correct directory in the settings at `/restrito/` if the uploaded file cannot be accessed.
