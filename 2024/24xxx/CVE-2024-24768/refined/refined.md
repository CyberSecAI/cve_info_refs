Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-24768:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the absence of the `Secure` attribute in the `Set-Cookie` header when the 1Panel application uses HTTPS. This means that cookies could be transmitted over unencrypted HTTP connections, even if HTTPS is configured.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing `Secure` attribute on session cookies.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:** Session cookies could be intercepted if a user accesses the application via HTTP instead of HTTPS. This can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts if the session cookie is stolen.
- **Integrity:** Attackers could potentially modify the session cookie, potentially leading to session hijacking or other attacks.
- **Availability:** While less direct, if an attacker gains unauthorized access, they could disrupt the service or user experience.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- An attacker could intercept the session cookie by observing HTTP traffic if the user accesses the application using an HTTP connection instead of HTTPS, or if a man-in-the-middle attack is conducted and the cookie is sent over the wire unencrypted.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the user and the server. This could be on the same local network or through a man-in-the-middle attack.
- The attacker requires low privileges as they can obtain a valid cookie through normal login procedures.
- User interaction is required (the user must visit the site over HTTP for the vulnerability to be exposed).

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `1Panel` versions prior to `v1.9.6`.
*   The fix implemented in commit `1169648` addresses this issue by adding the `Secure` flag to the session cookie when HTTPS is enabled.
*   The vulnerability is rated as **Moderate** with a CVSS score of 6.5.
