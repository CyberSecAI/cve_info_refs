- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation, which allows for a potential information disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user can exploit this vulnerability to disclose information via network access.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the network. The vulnerability requires user interaction (UI:R) and has a scope change (S:C). The attack complexity is low (AC:L) and requires low privileges (PR:L)
