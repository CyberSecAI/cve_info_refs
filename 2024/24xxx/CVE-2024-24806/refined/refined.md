{
  "CVE-2024-24806": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `uv_getaddrinfo` function truncates hostnames to 256 characters before calling getaddrinfo. This truncation can lead to addresses that resolve to unintended IP addresses.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper hostname handling in `uv_getaddrinfo` due to truncation without null termination.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to:\n  - Bypassing developer checks and resolving hostnames to unintended IP addresses.\n  - Access to internal APIs by crafting specific hostnames, leading to potential SSRF attacks.\n  - Server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks if internal services crawl or cache user-controlled pages with long, vulnerable hostnames.",
      "Attack vectors": "Crafting a specially designed hostname that is longer than 256 characters, exploiting the truncation within `uv_getaddrinfo`.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to supply a hostname, and can leverage a vulnerable Node.js application or service that uses `uv_getaddrinfo`."
    },
    {
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `uv_getaddrinfo` function in libuv truncates hostnames to 256 characters before calling getaddrinfo. When the hostname exceeds 256 characters, it is truncated without null termination which can result in the address being considered valid by getaddrinfo and potentially resolving to an unexpected IP address due to the random bytes in memory that may follow.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper handling of long hostnames leading to address resolution to unintended IP addresses.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS). Specifically, it can:\n\n* Access internal APIs by crafting malicious hostnames to bypass security checks.\n* Execute SSRF attacks by exploiting services that crawl and cache user provided URLs with long and crafted hostnames.",
        "Attack vectors": "An attacker would craft a hostname longer than 256 characters to exploit the truncation in `uv_getaddrinfo`.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to control or influence hostnames that are passed to a vulnerable application or system that uses libuv versions 1.24.0 and higher prior to 1.48.0."
