{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `enable` parameter in the `setParentalRules` request is vulnerable to OS command injection due to insufficient input validation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "OS command injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary OS commands can be executed on the device, potentially leading to complete compromise of the device. This could allow an attacker to control the router, eavesdrop on network traffic, or use the router as part of a botnet.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted POST request to the `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` endpoint with a malicious `enable` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. This would typically require network access to the device's LAN or, if the web interface is exposed to the internet, WAN access."
