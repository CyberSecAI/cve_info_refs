{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of user-provided paths during file downloads in the ClearML Datasets class.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Path traversal vulnerability in the `_download_external_files` method of the `Datasets` class.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can write arbitrary files to a user's file system at attacker-specified locations, potentially overwriting sensitive files or moving them to externally accessible locations. The use of `file://` protocol allows local files to be targeted.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can modify a dataset to include a malicious link pointing to a file and the path where it should be written on the user's system. When a user interacts with this dataset, for instance using the `Dataset.squash` method, the download is triggered and the file is written to the attacker-specified location.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to upload or modify a dataset within the ClearML environment. They also need to have knowledge of the path they want to write to."
