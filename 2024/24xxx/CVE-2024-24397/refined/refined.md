Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-24397

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The application fails to sanitize user-provided input in the `ReportName` field when a report is loaded.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when they interact with the report. This could lead to various malicious activities, including:
    - Stealing session cookies.
    - Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Defacing the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker injects a malicious XSS payload into the `ReportName` field of a report.
- The payload is stored persistently within the report definition.
- When a user loads the report, the unsanitized `ReportName` value triggers the execution of the stored XSS payload. Specifically, when the user clicks on "Properties" and expands the search bar, the XSS payload executes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access and modify the `ReportName` field, which appears to be a functionality of the application.
- The vulnerability is rated as unauthenticated, implying that no authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable component is Stimulsoft Dashboards.JS.
- Affected versions are below 2024.1.2.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 2024.1.3.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Ing. Simon Sch√∂negger, BSc, MSc, DI Lukas Hammer, BSc.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 7.6 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L).
