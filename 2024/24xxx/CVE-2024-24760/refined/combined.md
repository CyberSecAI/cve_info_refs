# Docker Container Exposure to Local Network

High

[DerLinkman](/DerLinkman)
published
GHSA-gmpj-5xcm-xxx6
Feb 2, 2024

## Package

mailcow: dockerized

## Affected versions

< 2024-01c

## Patched versions

>= 2024-01c

## Description

### Impact

A security vulnerability has been identified in mailcow affecting versions < 2024-01c. This vulnerability potentially allows attackers on the same subnet to connect to exposed ports of a Docker container, even when the port is bound to 127.0.0.1.

The vulnerability has been addressed by implementing additional iptables/nftables rules. These rules drop packets for Docker containers on ports 3306, 6379, 8983, and 12345, where the input interface is not `br-mailcow` and the output interface is `br-mailcow`.

It is highly recommended that all users upgrade to this latest version to ensure the security of their systems.

### Patches

Versions including 2024-01c and later

### Workarounds

Users who are unable to update immediately can apply the following iptables/nftables rule:

iptables:

`iptables -I DOCKER-USER ! -i br-mailcow -o br-mailcow -p tcp -m multiport --dport 3306,6379,8983,12345 -j DROP`

nftables:

`nft insert rule ip "filter" "DOCKER-USER" iifname != "br-mailcow" oifname "br-mailcow" tcp dport {3306, 6379, 8983, 12345} counter packets 0 bytes 0 drop`

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
