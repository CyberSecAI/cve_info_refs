Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-24557:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the classic builder cache system of Docker, specifically how it handles `FROM scratch` images.
- The cache system is susceptible to poisoning if a malicious image is presented as a valid cache candidate.
- Changes to certain instructions like `HEALTHCHECK` and `ONBUILD` are not causing cache misses, leading to the potential of using a poisoned cached image when a new build is executed with those instructions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Cache Poisoning:** The classic builder doesn't properly validate cached images when using `FROM scratch`, allowing an attacker to inject a malicious image into the cache.
- **Insufficient Cache Invalidation:** The builder does not recognize some important instruction changes (e.g. `HEALTHCHECK`, `ONBUILD`) as events that should invalidate the cache.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Compromised Builds:** An attacker can manipulate the image build process, potentially injecting malicious code or altering the functionality of the final image.
- **Substitution of commands:** An attacker can substitute a different `HEALTHCHECK` command by injecting a malicious image.
- **Supply Chain Attacks:** An attacker could poison the cache of users who pull images based on typosquatting.
- **Impacted systems:** CI pipelines with shared cache, regular users pulling malicious images, `/build` API endpoints and `ImageBuild` function.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Image Distribution:** An attacker crafts a malicious image that acts as a valid cache candidate for a specific `FROM scratch` Dockerfile and distributes it.
- **Typosquatting:** An attacker could upload an image that has a name similar to a legitimate one, and poison the cache of the user who pulls the malicious image.
- **Shared Cache Poisoning:** In scenarios where a shared cache is utilized (e.g., CI/CD pipelines), an attacker could inject a malicious image that is used by other builds.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Dockerfile Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the `FROM scratch` Dockerfile being used by the target.
- **Image Hosting:** The attacker needs to host a malicious image on a registry (or another mechanism that makes the image accessible) that the victim will use.
- **Cache Manipulation:** The attacker needs to induce the victim to pull the malicious image to poison the cache.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability primarily affects users who are not using BuildKit (`DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0`) or are using the `/build` API endpoint, which defaults to the classic builder.
- Users running Docker versions older than 23.0 are more likely to be affected.
- This vulnerability is classified as **moderate** with a CVSS score of 6.9.

**Mitigation:**

- Use BuildKit by setting `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1`.
- Use `--no-cache` during builds.
- Explicitly set `Version = types.BuilderBuildKit` or `NoCache = true` in `ImageBuildOptions` when using the `ImageBuild` API.
- Upgrade to the patched versions: 25.0.2, 24.0.9, and 23.0.10.
