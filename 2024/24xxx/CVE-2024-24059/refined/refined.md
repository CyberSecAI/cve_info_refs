The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in the `springboot-manager` project. Here's a breakdown:

**1. Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of input sanitization/validation for user-provided data before rendering it on the webpage.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Stored XSS in `/sys/user`: The `username` parameter is vulnerable.
    *   Stored XSS in `/sys/role`: Both `name` and `description` parameters are vulnerable.
    *   Stored XSS in `/sysContent/add`: `title` and `content` parameters are vulnerable.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, leading to:
    *   Arbitrary code execution in the victim's browser.
    *   Cookie theft, potentially leading to session hijacking.
    *   Worms that can propagate the attack to other users.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   A malicious user injects XSS payloads in the vulnerable parameters when creating/updating user accounts, roles, or content.
    *   When another user views a page displaying the malicious data, the injected JavaScript executes in the user's browser.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user able to modify the vulnerable data.

**2. File Upload Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper file type validation during file uploads.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The system does not properly filter or sanitize file extensions, allowing for the upload of files with arbitrary extensions, including malicious HTML files.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can upload malicious files (e.g., HTML files with embedded JavaScript), leading to:
    * Stored XSS when a user accesses the uploaded file.
    * Arbitrary code execution in the victim's browser.
    * Cookie theft, potentially leading to session hijacking.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    * An authenticated user uploads a malicious file, such as an HTML file containing JavaScript, via the `/sysFiles/upload` endpoint.
    * When the file is accessed by another user, the injected JavaScript code will be executed.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * The attacker must be an authenticated user capable of uploading files.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes detailed steps (POC) on how to reproduce the vulnerabilities using HTTP requests.
*   The code analysis highlights that the file upload vulnerability stems from the `sysFilesService.saveFile()` method, where the file extension is directly appended without any sanitization.
*  The `springboot-manager` project version `v1.6` is affected.
