The provided content describes a memory leak vulnerability in GPAC version 2.2.1.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the failure to free allocated memory, specifically, the `dst_props` variable which is allocated in `gf_filter_pid_merge_properties_internal` but not deallocated when the function returns prematurely.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: The program allocates memory for `dst_props` but does not release it under certain execution paths, specifically when returning from the `gf_filter_pid_merge_properties_internal` function at line 6131.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Repeated execution of the vulnerable code path would cause a gradual increase in memory consumption, eventually leading to resource exhaustion or program instability, potentially a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
-  The vulnerability could be triggered by providing input data that leads the execution path to the vulnerable code where the `dst_props` allocation is not freed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide input to a program that utilizes the vulnerable `gf_filter_pid_merge_properties_internal` function, to trigger the memory leak. No special position or high privileges are mentioned for successful exploitation.
