{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The function \"setSchedWifi\" reads in a user-provided parameter without any length check, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow due to missing length checks on user-provided input in the \"setSchedWifi\" function.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute a denial-of-service attack or remote code execution by overflowing the stack-based buffer with crafted data.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a request to the vulnerable page, an attacker can trigger the overflow.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a request to the vulnerable page. No other position or capability is mentioned"
