|  |  | The client has a mechanism for caching the received tokens. |
|  |  | This helps reduce the number of requests to both the service and the Identity Provider (IdP). |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | If the client has a valid \*\*access token\*\* in the cache, it is used until it expires. |

|  |  | Otherwise, the client makes an RPC call to the \*\*TornadoManager\*\* service. |
