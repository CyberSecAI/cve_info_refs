Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**1. Verification:**
The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in a "Math Game" application, which aligns with the CVE description mentioning a stored XSS.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the application's failure to sanitize user-supplied input in the "Your Name" field of the "Submit Score" section. This lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious script code.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Specifically, a stored XSS vulnerability, where the malicious script is saved and then executed when other users view the affected page.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly encode or validate user-provided data before displaying it on the page.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute malicious JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
- **Cookie Stealing:** Attackers can potentially steal cookie-based authentication credentials, leading to session hijacking.
- **Further Attacks:**  The attacker can launch other attacks by redirecting users to malicious sites or performing other browser-based attacks.
- **Account Compromise:** If session cookies are compromised, the attacker can gain control of the victim's account.

**5. Attack vectors:**
- **User Input:** The primary attack vector is the "Your Name" input field in the score submission form.
- **Web Browser:** The attack is executed within the user's web browser when the unsanitized input is displayed.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Basic Web Access:** The attacker needs access to the vulnerable web application.
- **Ability to Manipulate Input:** The attacker needs to be able to enter arbitrary text into the vulnerable input field.
- **No Prior Authentication:** The attacker does not need to authenticate prior to injecting the script.

**Technical details:**
- **Payload example:** `<video/src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>` which uses the onerror event of a video tag to trigger an alert.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) steps clearly describe how an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting a payload into the "Your Name" field of the Submit Score section after playing the game.
