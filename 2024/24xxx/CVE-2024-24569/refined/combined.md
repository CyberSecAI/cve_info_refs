# `ZipSecurity` is vulnerable to partial-path traversal vulnerability

Moderate

[nahsra](/nahsra)
published
GHSA-qh4g-4m4w-jgv2
Feb 1, 2024

## Package

maven

io.github.pixee:java-security-toolkit
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

<=1.1.1

## Patched versions

1.1.2

## Description

### Summary

`ZipSecurity#isBelowCurrentDirectory` is vulnerable to a partial-path traversal bypass.

### Impact

To be vulnerable to the bypass, the following conditions must all be met:

* Applications that uses toolkit version <=1.1.1
* Applications that uses `ZipSecurity` as a guard against path traversal
* Applications that have a exploit path

Although the control still protects attackers from escaping the application path into higher level directories (e.g., `/etc/`), it will allow "escaping" into sibling paths.

For example, if your running path is `/my/app/path` you an attacker could navigate into `/my/app/path-something-else`.

### Details

See:

[java-security-toolkit/src/main/java/io/github/pixee/security/ZipSecurity.java](https://github.com/pixee/java-security-toolkit/blob/7c8e93e6fb2420fb6003c54a741e267c4f883bab/src/main/java/io/github/pixee/security/ZipSecurity.java#L82-L87)

Lines 82 to 87
in
[7c8e93e](/pixee/java-security-toolkit/commit/7c8e93e6fb2420fb6003c54a741e267c4f883bab)

|  | boolean isBelowCurrentDirectory(final File fileWithEscapes) throws IOException { |
| --- | --- |
|  | final File currentDirectory = new File(""); |
|  | String canonicalizedTargetPath = fileWithEscapes.getCanonicalPath(); |
|  | String canonicalizedCurrentPath = currentDirectory.getCanonicalPath(); |
|  | return !canonicalizedTargetPath.startsWith(canonicalizedCurrentPath); |
|  | } |

This method is vulnerable because `currentDirectory.getCanonicalPath()` returns a string that is not terminated by a trailing slash. As such, using `startsWith` to do string comparisons opens up a weakness allowing for partial-path traversal into a sibling directory.

### PoC

This vulnerability is described in detail in Jonathan Leitschuh's Black Hat talk: <https://youtu.be/zTtbVxGEq8A?si=Nmt0aGpPnSPrzTxi>

Assume that the working directory for the given Java process is a directory named `code-sandbox`. The following test demonstrates escaping that directory.

```
    @Test
    void pixeeZipGuardBypass() throws IOException {
        File bypass = new File("../code-sandbox-sibling/bypass");
        assertTrue(isBelowCurrentDirectory(bypass), "The attacker provided value escaped the intended directory!");
    }

    boolean isBelowCurrentDirectory(final File fileWithEscapes) throws IOException {
        final File currentDirectory = new File("");
        String canonicalizedTargetPath = fileWithEscapes.getCanonicalPath();
        String canonicalizedCurrentPath = currentDirectory.getCanonicalPath();
        return !canonicalizedTargetPath.startsWith(canonicalizedCurrentPath);
    }
```
### Credit

Thanks to Jonathan Leitschuh for discovering and reporting the vulnerability.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
