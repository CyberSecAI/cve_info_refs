Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-24014

**Affected Product:** Novel-Plus v4.3.0-RC1 and prior versions.

**Fixed Version:** Novel-Plus v4.3.0-RC1 (Note: This seems contradictory, as it states both the affected and fixed version as v4.3.0-RC1, which may indicate an error in the source or imply the fix was a patch applied to the same version)

**Root Cause:** A SQL injection vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of user-provided input.

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is located in the `/novel/author/list` endpoint. An attacker can manipulate the `offset`, `limit`, and `sort` parameters.

**Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious SQL statements within the `offset`, `limit`, and `sort` parameters in the request to `/novel/author/list`.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows the attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to:
   - Data Breach: Unauthorized access and retrieval of sensitive data from the database.
   - Data Modification: Alteration or deletion of data.
   - Denial of Service: Disrupting the normal operation of the application.
   - Complete System Compromise: Depending on database permissions, it could allow the attacker to gain shell access to the underlying server.

The provided information details a SQL injection vulnerability, the affected product and versions, the vulnerable endpoint, and how an attacker could exploit it, along with the potential impacts. The content also specifies that the fix is in v4.3.0-RC1, which seems inconsistent with the affected versions also including v4.3.0-RC1, this may imply a patch was applied to the same version.
