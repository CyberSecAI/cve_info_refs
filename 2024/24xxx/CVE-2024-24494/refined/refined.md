- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize user input when storing it in the database and reflecting it back on the page, allowing for injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web application's database. When other users access the affected page, the stored script executes, potentially stealing data or compromising user security.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects malicious scripts through vulnerable parameters in the `add-tracker.php` and `update-tracker.php` endpoints using HTTP POST requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoints (`add-tracker.php`, `update-tracker.php`) with malicious script payloads in the `day`, `exercise`, `pray`, `read_book`, `vitamins`, `laundry`, `alcohol`, and `meat` parameters.
