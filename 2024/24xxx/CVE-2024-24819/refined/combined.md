# Base implementation for HTML forms is susceptible to CSRF

Moderate

[nilmerg](/nilmerg)
published
GHSA-p8vv-9pqq-rm8p
Feb 8, 2024

## Package

icingaweb2-module-incubator
(Icinga)

## Affected versions

>=0.1.0

## Patched versions

0.21.0, 0.22.0

## Description

### Impact

The class `gipfl\Web\Form` is the base for various concrete form implementations [1] and provides protection against cross site request forgery (CSRF) by default.

This is done by automatically adding an element with a CSRF token to any form, unless explicitly disabled.

But even if enabled, the CSRF token (sent during a client's submission of a form relying on it) is not validated.

This enables attackers to perform changes on behalf of a user which, unknowingly, interacts with a prepared link or website.

### Patches

The version 0.22.0 is available to remedy this issue.

### References

1. <https://github.com/search?q=gipfl%5CWeb%5CForm%3B&type=code>

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-24819
