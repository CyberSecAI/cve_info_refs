Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2024-24814:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation on the `mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks` cookie value when `OIDCSessionType client-cookie` is used.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Input Validation:** The module doesn't properly validate the integer value of the `mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks` cookie.
*   **Unbounded Chunk Count:** The code iterates through cookie chunks based on the provided value without proper bounds checking which can cause an excessive number of iterations

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By setting a very large integer value (e.g., 99999999) for the `mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks` cookie, an attacker can force the server to struggle with the request, leading to slow responses and eventually a 500 error. Multiple such requests can render the server unresponsive or cause it to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** An attacker manipulates the `mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks` cookie value within an HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker doesn't need any privileges or prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** No user interaction is required.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability specifically affects the scenario when the `OIDCSessionType client-cookie` setting is enabled.
*   The `mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks` cookie is intended to track the number of session cookie chunks when session data exceeds the size limit.
*   The fix involves adding a check to ensure that the chunk count is not out of bounds `(chunkCount < 0) || (chunkCount > 99)` before processing the chunked cookies. Also, error handling was added for when a chunk is not found in the cookie list.

**Patched Versions:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in `mod_auth_openidc` version 2.4.15.2 and later.
*   Debian LTS fixed the issue in version `2.3.10.2-1+deb10u4`.
*   Fedora 39 includes the fix in version `2.4.15.3-1.fc39`.

**CVSS Metrics:**

*   **CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L**
    *   Attack Vector: Network
