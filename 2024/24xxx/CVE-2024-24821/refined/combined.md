# Code execution and possible privilege escalation via compromised InstalledVersions.php or installed.php

High

[Seldaek](/Seldaek)
published
GHSA-7c6p-848j-wh5h
Feb 8, 2024

## Package

composer

composer/composer
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

>=2.0,<2.2.23 || >=2.3,<2.7

## Patched versions

2.2.23, 2.7.0

## Description

### Impact

Several files within the local working directory are included during the invocation of Composer and in the context of the executing user.

As such, under certain conditions arbitrary code execution may lead to local privilege escalation, provide lateral user movement or malicious code execution when Composer is invoked within a directory with tampered files.

All Composer CLI commands are affected, including composer.phar's self-update.

The following are of high risk:

* Composer being run with sudo.
* Pipelines which may execute Composer on untrusted projects.
* Shared environments with developers who run Composer individually on the same project.

### Patches

2.7.0, 2.2.23

### Workarounds

* It is advised that the patched versions are applied at the earliest convenience.

Where not possible, the following should be addressed:

* Remove all sudo composer privileges for all users to mitigate root privilege escalation.
* Avoid running Composer within an untrusted directory, or if needed, verify that the contents of `vendor/composer/InstalledVersions.php` and `vendor/composer/installed.php` do not include untrusted code.

A reset can also be done on these files by the following:

```
rm vendor/composer/installed.php vendor/composer/InstalledVersions.php
composer install --no-scripts --no-plugins
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
