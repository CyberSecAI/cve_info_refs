{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user input in the 'Menu Name' and 'Description' fields before rendering them in the admin panel, allowing for the injection of malicious HTML and JavaScript.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary script code, which will be executed in the browser of an unsuspecting user when they access the admin panel. This can lead to:\n    - Stealing of cookie-based authentication credentials.\n    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim.\n    - Further exploitation such as session hijacking.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker modifies the 'Menu Name' or 'Description' fields via the `localhost/food-menu/admin.php` update menu function."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have access to the admin panel to modify menu items, which usually implies that they have admin level access or they can trick an admin user.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerable fields are the 'Menu Name' and 'Description' fields in the Update Menu section of `localhost/food-menu/admin.php`."
