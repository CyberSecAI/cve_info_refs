SSA-000072: Multiple File Parsing Vulnerabilities in Simcenter Femap

| Publication Date: | 2024-02-13 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2024-03-12 |
| Current Version: | V1.1 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 7.8 |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score: | 7.3 |

SUMMARY

Simcenter Femap contains multiple file parsing vulnerabilities that could be triggered when the application reads files in Catia MODEL file formats. If a user is tricked to open a malicious file with any of the affected products, this could lead the application to crash or potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

Siemens has released a new version for Simcenter Femap and recommends to update to the latest version.

WORKAROUNDS

AND
MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:

* Do not open untrusted Catia MODEL files from using Simcenter Femap

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section
[Affected Products and Solution](#affected-products-section).

Please follow the [General Security Recommendations](#general-recommendations).

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.
