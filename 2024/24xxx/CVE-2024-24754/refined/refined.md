Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-24754:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an inconsistency in how Bref, a PHP framework for serverless applications, parses multipart form data compared to standard PHP. Specifically, the `parseKeyAndInsertValueInArray` function in `Psr7Bridge.php` handles keys ending with an open square bracket (`[`) differently than PHP's default parsing behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Inconsistent Multipart Parsing:** Bref's custom parsing logic for multipart form data, specifically within the `parseKeyAndInsertValueInArray` function, deviates from the behavior of standard PHP.
- **Malformed Key Handling:** When encountering keys with trailing open brackets (`[`), Bref's parsing logic appends the value to the array at an unexpected location, and also creates a new array key with the malformed key as the name.
- The custom implementation of `parseKeyAndInsertValueInArray` fails to handle edge cases such as nested arrays with trailing open bracket `[` in the key, which causes unexpected behavior compared to the PHP default behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Application Logic Issues:** The difference in parsing behavior can cause unexpected results and potential vulnerabilities. Application logic that relies on the standard PHP parsing of form data might break or behave incorrectly when used with Bref.
- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** Depending on how the application uses the parsed data, this inconsistency can lead to various vulnerabilities such as data corruption, injection attacks, or unexpected application behaviors.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Multipart Form Data:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a multipart form data request with specially crafted keys that contain trailing open brackets.
- **HTTP Requests:** Attackers can exploit this by sending HTTP POST requests with manipulated multipart form data to Bref-based applications using the Event-Driven Function runtime.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected Bref application.
- **Knowledge of Multipart Form Data:** The attacker needs to have an understanding of how multipart form data works to craft the malicious request.
- **No special privileges:** No special privileges are required, the attacker only needs to send an HTTP request.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Affected Code:** The vulnerability exists in `bref/src/Event/Http/Psr7Bridge.php` within the `parseKeyAndInsertValueInArray` function.
- **Patched Version:** The issue is fixed in version 2.1.13 of the `bref/bref` package.
- **Suggested Remediation:** The suggested solution is to use PHP's built-in `parse_str` function to handle the parsing of body parameters which would mimic the plain PHP behavior, instead of relying on a custom implementation.

The provided commit diff shows the fix includes:
    - A cleanup function to delete previously uploaded files by using a `glob` pattern to remove temporary files created during the multipart request parsing.
    - A more secure `tempnam` implementation for temporary file creation during parsing.

The advisory also includes a PoC to test the described behavior.
