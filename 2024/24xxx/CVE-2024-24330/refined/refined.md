{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before passing it to the system shell, leading to command injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "OS Command Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the device. In this case, the attacker is able to list the contents of directories.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` endpoint with a crafted JSON payload containing malicious commands within the `port` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. This likely means they need to be on the same network as the device or be able to access the device through an open port. The attacker also needs a valid `token`."
