Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   **Mass Assignment:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation and authorization checks when a user updates their profile. Specifically, the system allowed a user to modify their user capabilities (user\_caps) by sending a POST request to `server/fm-modules/facileManager/ajax/processPost.php`, even if they were not an administrator.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Non-admin users could grant themselves superuser privileges (i.e., `do_everything` capability) by manipulating the `user_caps` parameter in the POST request.
*   **Insufficient Authorization Checks:** The code failed to properly verify if the user making the request had the necessary permissions to modify other users' capabilities, particularly in the `updateUser` function, as evidenced in the changes to `class_users.php`.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Complete System Takeover:** By escalating their privileges, an attacker could gain full control over the application, including the ability to access sensitive data, modify configurations, and potentially disrupt the entire system.
*   **Data Breach/Manipulation:** Full control over the application would allow malicious actors to access, modify, or delete sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request Manipulation:** The attack is carried out by crafting a malicious HTTP POST request to the `server/fm-modules/facileManager/ajax/processPost.php` endpoint when a user updates their profile, setting the `user_caps[facileManager][do_everything]` parameter to `1`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a valid, authenticated user of the application, although not necessarily an admin.

**Additional notes:**

*   The provided commit log also mentions fixes for SQL Injection and XSS vulnerabilities, but the primary focus of this CVE is the privilege escalation through mass assignment.
*   The vulnerability is present in `facileManager` versions `<=4.5.0` and is patched in `4.5.1`.
* The fix involved a more robust check in `class_users.php` to prevent modification of capabilities unless permitted.
* There is no CWE assigned.
