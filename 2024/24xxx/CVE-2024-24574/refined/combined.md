Feb 5, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

3.2.4

## Patched versions

3.2.5

## Description

### Summary

Unsafe echo of filename in phpMyFAQ\phpmyfaq\admin\attachments.php leading to allow execute JavaScript code in client side (XSS)

### Details

On that snippet code of rendering the file attachments from user tables

```
<?php foreach ($crumbs as $item) : ?>
        <tr id="attachment_<?= $item->id ?>" title="<?= $item->thema ?>">
          <td><?= $item->id ?></td>
          <td><?= $item->filename ?></td>
          <td><?= $item->record_lang ?></td>
          <td><?= Utils::formatBytes($item->filesize) ?></td>
          <td><?= $item->mime_type ?></td>
          <td>

```

The data directly rendering with short hand echo without any sanitation first, its recommend to use existing class of `Strings::htmlentities` on use `phpMyFAQ\Strings;`

```
<td><?= Strings::htmlentities($item->filename); ?></td>
<td><?= Strings::htmlentities($item->record_lang); ?></td>
<td><?= Utils::formatBytes($item->filesize) ?></td>
<td><?= Strings::htmlentities($item->mime_type); ?></td>

```
