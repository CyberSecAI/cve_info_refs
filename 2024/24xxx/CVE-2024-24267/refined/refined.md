Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a memory leak in the `gf_fileio_from_mem` and `gf_fileio_from_blob` functions within the GPAC library.
*   **Weakness:** When `gf_fileio_new` fails in `gf_fileio_from_mem`, or an error occurs before line 1451 in `gf_fileio_from_blob`,  the allocated memory for `gfio_blob` is not freed before the function returns, leading to a memory leak.
*   **Impact:** Repeated calls to vulnerable functions without proper error handling could lead to memory exhaustion.
*  **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing specific input that will cause the `gf_fileio_new` function to fail or cause an error before line 1451.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to call the vulnerable functions with specific parameters that result in an error condition.

**Specific Function Breakdown:**

*   **`gf_fileio_from_mem` (from `os_file.c`):**
    *   Allocates memory for `gfio_blob`.
    *   If `gf_fileio_new` fails after line 1447, the allocated memory for `gfio_blob` is not released.
*   **`gf_fileio_from_blob` (from `os_file.c`):**
    *   Allocates memory for `gfio_blob`.
    *   If `gf_fileio_new` fails (after line 1451 in the provided code), the allocated memory for `gfio_blob` is not released.
*   **Code Location:**
    *   `gf_fileio_from_mem` and `gf_fileio_from_blob` functions are located in `src/utils/os_file.c`

**Patch Details**
*   The commit `d28d9ba45cf4f628a7b2c351849a895e6fcf2234` addresses this vulnerability by adding a call to `gf_free(gfio_blob)` before returning NULL in the `gf_fileio_from_mem` function if `res` is null.

**Additional Notes**

*   The provided information indicates the vulnerability was identified by a static analyzer tool.
*   The vulnerability affects GPAC version 2.2.1 and was fixed in a later version
*   The issue was originally reported in issue #2571 and was fixed by commit `d28d9ba`

**Summary**

The identified memory leak in `gf_fileio_from_mem` and `gf_fileio_from_blob` within the GPAC library, allows for a potential memory exhaustion attack if exploited by triggering a specific error condition within the affected functions.
