The provided content is related to CVE-2024-24112, as it describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the xmall project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization of the `order[0][dir]` parameter within the `/item/list` interface. This unsanitized parameter is then directly used within an SQL query via `${}` in the `TbItemMapper.xml` file, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct inclusion of user-supplied data into the SQL query without proper sanitization.
- Unsafe parameter usage: Specifically, the `orderDir` parameter is used directly within the SQL query, leading to injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The impact includes potential unauthorized access to the database, data manipulation, and possibly remote code execution (as indicated by `Impact Code execution: true`).
- The vulnerability allows for information disclosure, including database name and user information, demonstrated by the provided payload using `union select updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,database(),0x7e,user(),0x7e),1)`.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote via HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
- Specific vulnerable endpoints:
    - `/item/list`
    - `/item/listSearch`
    - `/sys/log`
    - `/order/list`
    - `/member/list` (time-based blind injection)
    - `/member/list/remove` (time-based blind injection)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
- No special privileges are required.
- Knowledge of the application's API and structure is beneficial for crafting specific payloads.
- The attacker can be considered remote as the vulnerable interfaces are exposed via the web interface.
