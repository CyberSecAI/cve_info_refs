Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-24398

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of the `fileName` parameter in the request to save a report. The application does not properly validate the path, allowing directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Write:** The application is vulnerable to arbitrary file write due to the ability to manipulate the save path via the `fileName` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can write files to any location on the server that the web server's user has access to.
- This could lead to overwriting existing files, injecting malicious code, or creating new files to achieve further malicious objectives.
- Partial loss of confidentiality, high integrity impact, and partial availability impact

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted request to save a report on the server, specifically by manipulating the `fileName` parameter.
- The attack is performed remotely over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is required since the product doesn't handle authentication on its own.

**Additional Information:**
- **Affected Product:** Stimulsoft Dashboards.PHP
- **Affected Versions:** Versions prior to 2024.1.3
- **Fixed Version:** 2024.1.3
- **CVSS Score:** 8.6 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L)
- The vulnerable parameter is `fileName`.
- The file is normally written to `<webroot>/php/reports`. By including path traversal sequences like `../` in the `fileName` parameter, an attacker can write the file to other locations.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Ing. Simon Sch√∂negger, BSc, MSc, and DI Lukas Hammer, BSc.
