Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-24697

**Root Cause:** An untrusted search path in some Zoom 32-bit Windows clients.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Untrusted Search Path:** The application searches for required libraries or executables in locations that are not secure or controlled by the system/application itself. This can lead to loading malicious executables or libraries if placed in those locations.
*  **Privilege Escalation:**  Exploitation of the untrusted search path can allow an attacker to execute code with higher privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Escalation of Privilege:**  A local user can escalate their privileges, potentially gaining full control over the affected system.
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By loading malicious libraries or executables, an attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution with escalated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the machine where the vulnerable Zoom client is installed.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires the user to perform a specific action which triggers the vulnerable search path logic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the affected Windows system.
*   The attacker needs to be able to write files to locations searched by the Zoom client.
* The attacker needs to convince the user to perform some action that triggers the vulnerable code path.

**Affected Products:**

*   Zoom Desktop Client for Windows before version 5.17.0
*   Zoom VDI Client for Windows before version 5.17.5 (excluding 5.15.15 and 5.16.12)
*   Zoom Meeting SDK for Windows before version 5.17.0
*   Zoom Rooms Client for Windows before version 5.17.0

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability is specific to 32-bit Windows clients.
* The provided CVSS score is 7.2 which is considered High severity.
* The vulnerability was reported by sim0nsecurity.
* The vendor recommends users to update to the latest versions to mitigate this vulnerability.
