Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-24753:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Bref (a serverless PHP framework) handles HTTP response headers when used with AWS API Gateway v2. Bref incorrectly processes multiple headers with the same key, only keeping the last one, while API Gateway v2 expects multiple header values to be comma-separated.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect header handling:**  The `HttpResponse` class in Bref's `src/Event/Http/HttpResponse.php` was not correctly formatting multi-value headers for API Gateway v2. It was picking the last value instead of concatenating all values with a comma.
- **Security misconfiguration:** This issue could lead to security misconfigurations, particularly when an application relies on multiple headers with the same key for security features like Content-Security-Policy (CSP).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Bypassed security policies:** An attacker could potentially bypass security policies defined using multiple `Content-Security-Policy` headers. For instance, if an application sets multiple CSP headers to restrict different resources, Bref would only apply the last one. This could allow execution of scripts or loading of resources that should be blocked by CSP.
- **Reduced application security:** The vulnerability can potentially lead to reduced overall security of applications deployed with Bref.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP request manipulation:** An attacker does not directly exploit the vulnerability through a network request. However, the vulnerability is exploited through a crafted PHP application which sets multiple headers of the same name and the incorrect way that Bref transforms these into the format for API Gateway v2

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to deploy a vulnerable application:** The attacker must be able to deploy a PHP application using Bref that leverages multiple headers with the same key. They would rely on the application's misconfiguration due to the vulnerability in Bref. They need to be able to control the headers that are sent in the response of the application
- **Application uses API Gateway v2:** The application must be deployed on AWS Lambda using API Gateway v2 for this vulnerability to manifest.

**Additional details:**
- The provided content includes a proof of concept (PoC) demonstrating how a `Content-Security-Policy` can be bypassed due to the vulnerability in Bref.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Bref version 2.1.13 by concatenating all multiple values of the same header key with a comma.
- The vulnerability is rated as low severity.
