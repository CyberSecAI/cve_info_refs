- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-use-after-free error occurs in the `SplitChar` function within `jsiUtils.c` at line 2060. This is triggered during the execution of the `split()` method on a large string. The issue arises due to incorrect memory management after a reallocation.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-use-after-free vulnerability. The program attempts to access memory that has already been freed.

- **Impact of exploitation:** This could lead to crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution if an attacker has control over the input string and the jsish program.

- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by supplying a crafted string to the `split()` method. This can be done using a provided JavaScript-like test case that calls the split method on a large string.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to execute jsish code with a crafted string. This would mean the attacker must have some level of access to the jsish environment.
