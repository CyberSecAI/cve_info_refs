### @jason0x90 **[jason0x90](/jason0x90)** commented [Mar 16, 2019](#issue-421757197)

icingaweb2-module-map is vulnerable to cross site scripting attacks via injected javascript, for example:

map?default\_lat=35.92464453144099&default\_long=-120.38818359375001;alert(%27xss%20verified%27)&default\_zoom=6&view=compact

would inject a javascript payload.

I've made a patch here to intval() variables that will only be ints, and then lat/long is filtered to only 0-9-., chars, and the rest just strip out '; chars so you can't escape out of the printed javascript.

Sorry, something went wrong.

# Configuration is susceptible to CSRF

High

[nilmerg](/nilmerg)
published
GHSA-3mwp-5p5v-j6q3
Feb 8, 2024

## Package

Icinga Director
(Icinga)

## Affected versions

>=1.0.0

## Patched versions

1.8.2, 1.9.2, 1.10.3, 1.11.1

## Description

### Impact

Not any of Icinga Director's configuration forms used to manipulate the monitoring environment are protected against cross site request forgery. (CSRF)

It enables attackers to perform changes in the monitoring environment managed by Icinga Director without the awareness of the victim.

There are two ways this can happen and both need to lure an unsuspecting user, which is currently logged into Icinga Web with the appropriate access rights, to:

#### Visit a Specially Crafted Website

A website set up by the attacker may be able to manipulate the monitoring environment, if a user visits or interacts with it. In the worst case, just visiting the website triggers multiple changes.

The browser must permit transmission of access credentials during cross-origin requests for this to work.

Modern browsers used today, impose several security measures against this though:

* Firefox uses a way to protect cookies called *Total Cookie Protection* [1] and is enabled by default since April 2023
* Safari uses a similar method called *Prevent cross-site tracking* [2] available in the privacy preferences
* Chrome/Opera/Edge rely on a cookie attribute and will apply a suitable default since February 2020 [3] if not set, which is the case for Icinga Web

#### Click a Specially Crafted URL

Known vulnerabilities in Icinga Web [4] and the map module by Nicola Buchwitz [5] may allow the attacker to bypass any security measures imposed by a browser by use of cross-site scripting. (XSS)

Users of the map module in version 1.x, should immediately upgrade to v2.0. The mentioned XSS vulnerabilities in Icinga Web are already fixed as well and upgrades to the most recent release of the 2.9, 2.10 or 2.11 branch must be performed if not done yet. Any later major release is also suitable, of course.

### What can you do?

Icinga Director will receive minor updates to the 1.8, 1.9, 1.10 and 1.11 branches to remedy this issue.

Upgrade immediately to a patched release. If that is not feasible, disable the *director* module for the time being.

### Have you already been attacked?

Since an attacker is able to manipulate everything the Icinga Director allows to adjust, the manipulations may be substantial. Some require distinct knowledge of the monitoring system, but many do not. You should check for unknown objects and suspicious changes in these key areas:

* Commands and Templates
* Import-Sources

As long as Icinga Director isn't upgraded and patched, make sure to also keep an eye on the *Activity Log* as this might also contain suspicious entries.

In very rare cases, the attacker might have been able to gain limited system access. If Icinga is running on a host which is able to connect to the Internet, make sure to check network activity for suspicious connections.

## [Launch Timeline](#launch-timeline)

Last updated Mar 18, 2021.

Latest update:

**Mar 18, 2021:** The flags #same-site-by-default-cookies and
#cookies-without-same-site-must-be-secure have been removed from chrome://flags
as of Chrome 91, as the behavior is now enabled by default. In Chrome 94, the
command-line flag
--disable-features=SameSiteByDefaultCookies,CookiesWithoutSameSiteMustBeSecure
will be removed.

For the full Chrome release schedule, [see
here](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/schedule). For the SameSite-by-default
and SameSite=None-requires-Secure launch timeline, see below:

* **Early October, 2019**: Experimental
  [SameSite-by-default](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5088147346030592)
  and
  [SameSite=None-requires-Secure](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5633521622188032)
  behavior launched to 50% of users on Chrome Canary and Dev (Chrome
  Canary and Dev versions 78+). Windows and Mac users on domain-joined
  devices and Chrome OS users on enterprise-registered devices will be
  excluded from the experiment. Chrome 78 Beta users will not receive
  the experimental behavior.
* **October 31, 2019**: Chrome 79 Beta released. Experiment extended
  to 50% of Chrome 79 Beta users, including domain-joined and
  enterprise-registered devices.
  [Policies](/administrators/policy-list-3/cookie-legacy-samesite-policies)
  to manage the experimental behavior (see below) will be available on
  Chrome 79.
* **Dec 10, 2019**: Chrome 79 Stable released. Stable users on Chrome
  79 will NOT receive the new SameSite behavior.
* **Dec 19, 2019**: Chrome 80 Beta released. Experimental behavior
  still enabled for 50% of Chrome 80 Beta users.
* **February 4, 2020**: Chrome 80 Stable released. The enablement of
  the SameSite-by-default and SameSite=None-requires-Secure
  enforcement will not be included in this initial Chrome 80 stable
  rollout. Please see the next item for more detailed information on
  the when SameSite enforcement will be enabled for Chrome 80 stable.
* **February, 2020**: Enforcement rollout for Chrome 80 Stable: The
  SameSite-by-default and SameSite=None-requires-Secure behaviors will
  begin rolling out to Chrome 80 Stable for an initial limited
  population starting the week of February 17, 2020, excluding the US
  President’s Day holiday on Monday. We will be closely monitoring and
  evaluating ecosystem impact from this initial limited phase through
  gradually increasing rollouts.
* **March 2, 2020**: The enablement of the SameSite enforcements has
  been increased beyond the initial population. However, it is still
  targeting an overall limited global population of users on Chrome 80
  stable and newer. We continue to monitor metrics and ecosystem
  feedback via our [tracking
  bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1052195),
  and other support channels.
* **March 9, 2020**: The rollout population has been additionally
  increased, although it continues to target a fraction of the overall
  Chrome 80 stable population. We continue to monitor metrics and
  ecosystem feedback via our [tracking
  bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1052195),
  and other support channels.
* **April 3, 2020**: In light of the extraordinary global
  circumstances due to COVID-19, [we’ve decided to temporarily roll
  back the enforcement of SameSite cookie labeling on Chrome 80
  stable](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/04/temporarily-rolling-back-samesite.html).
  We recognize the efforts of sites and individual developers who
  prepared for this change as part of our ongoing effort to improve
  privacy and security across the web. We appreciate the feedback from
  across the web ecosystem which has helped inform this decision. We
  will provide advance notice on here and the Chromium blog when we
  plan to resume the gradual rollout, which we’re now aiming for over
  the summer. Non-stable Chrome channels (e.g. Dev, Canary, and Beta)
  will continue with 50% enablement in Chrome 80 and later. More
  details on [Chromium
  blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/04/temporarily-rolling-back-samesite.html).
* **May 28, 2020**: We are planning to resume our SameSite cookie
  enforcement coinciding with the stable release of Chrome 84 on July
  14, with enforcement enabled for Chrome 80+. (In other words,
  starting July 14, Chrome users on the older Stable releases (80, 81,
  and 83 -- for whom we recommend installing the latest update!) as
  well as the newly released Chrome 84 will gradually begin to receive
  the SameSite-by-default behavior.) Read more on our [Chromium blog
  post](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/resuming-samesite-cookie-changes-in-july.html).
* **July 14, 2020**: SameSite cookie enforcement has resumed, with a
  gradual rollout starting today (July 14) and ramping up over the
  next several weeks as we continue to monitor overall ecosystem
  readiness and engage with websites and services to ensure they are
  prepared for the SameSite labeling policy. The SameSite features are
  being enabled for Chrome Stable channel users on versions 80 and 81
  (who should update Chrome!), 83, as well as the newly released 84.
* **July 28, 2020**: The rollout population has been increased to
  target a fraction of the overall Chrome 80+ stable population. We
  are monitoring metrics and ecosystem feedback on our [tracking
  bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1052195).

  **Aug 11, 2020:** The target rollout population has been increased to 100%
  of users on Chrome Stable versions 80 and above, and the actual proportion
  of users with the new behavior enabled is now ramping up to 100% gradually.
  Users will receive the new behavior when they restart Chrome.

~~The new SameSite behavior will not be enforced on Android WebView until
later,~~ though app developers are advised to declare the appropriate SameSite
cookie settings for Android WebViews based on versions of Chrome that are
compatible with the None value, both for cookies accessed via HTTP(S) headers
and via Android WebView's [CookieManager
API](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/CookieManager).
[**UPDATE Jan 8, 2021**: The modern SameSite behavior ([SameSite=Lax by
default, SameSite=None requires
Secure](https://web.dev/samesite-cookies-explained/), and [Schemeful
Same-Site](https://web.dev/schemeful-samesite/)) will be enabled by default for
Android WebView on apps targeting Android 12 and newer. Existing apps will not
be affected until they choose to update to target Android 12. Android 12 has not
yet been released. Existing apps can be tested with the new modern SameSite
behavior by toggling the flag webview-enable-modern-cookie-same-site in the
[developer
UI](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2B/HEAD/android_webview/docs/developer-ui.md#Flag-UI).]
This does not apply to Chrome browser on Android, which will begin to enforce
the new SameSite rules at the same time as the desktop versions of Chrome. The
new SameSite behavior will not affect Chrome on iOS.

## [Mar 18, 2021](#mar-18-2021)

The flags #same-site-by-default-cookies and
#cookies-without-same-site-must-be-secure have been removed from chrome://flags
as of Chrome 91, as the behavior is now enabled by default. In Chrome 94, the
command-line flag
--disable-features=SameSiteByDefaultCookies,CookiesWithoutSameSiteMustBeSecure
will be removed.

## [Jan 8, 2021](#jan-8-2021)

The modern SameSite behavior ([SameSite=Lax by default, SameSite=None requires
Secure](https://web.dev/samesite-cookies-explained/), and [Schemeful
Same-Site](https://web.dev/schemeful-samesite/)) will be enabled by default for
Android WebView on apps targeting Android 12 (Android S) and newer. Existing
apps will not be affected until they choose to update to target Android 12.
Android 12 has not yet been released. Existing apps can be tested with the new
modern SameSite behavior by toggling the flag
webview-enable-modern-cookie-same-site in the [developer
UI](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2B/HEAD/android_webview/docs/developer-ui.md#Flag-UI).

## [Aug 11, 2020](#aug-11-2020)

The target rollout population has been increased to 100% of users on Chrome
Stable versions 80 and above, and the actual proportion of users with the new
behavior enabled is now ramping up to 100% gradually. Users will receive the new
behavior when they restart Chrome.

## [Jul 28, 2020](#jul-28-2020)

The rollout population has been increased to target a fraction of the overall
Chrome 80+ stable population. We are monitoring metrics and ecosystem feedback
on our [tracking
bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1052195).

## [Jul 14, 2020](#jul-14-2020)

SameSite cookie enforcement has resumed, with a gradual rollout starting today
(July 14) and ramping up over the next several weeks as we continue to monitor
overall ecosystem readiness and engage with websites and services to ensure they
are prepared for the SameSite labeling policy. The SameSite features are being
enabled for Chrome Stable channel users on versions 80 and 81 (who should update
Chrome!), 83, as well as the newly released 84.

## [May 28, 2020](#may-28-2020)

We are planning to resume our SameSite cookie enforcement coinciding with the
stable release of Chrome 84 on July 14, with enforcement enabled for Chrome 80+.
(In other words, starting July 14, Chrome users on the older Stable releases
(80, 81, and 83 -- for whom we recommend installing the latest update!) as well
as the newly released Chrome 84 will gradually begin to receive the
SameSite-by-default behavior.) Read more on our [Chromium blog
post](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/resuming-samesite-cookie-changes-in-july.html).

## [Apr 3, 2020](#apr-3-2020)

[We’ve decided to temporarily roll back the enforcement of SameSite cookie
labeling on Chrome 80
Stable](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/04/temporarily-rolling-back-samesite.html)
and kSameSiteByDefaultCookies is once again set to
base::FEATURE\_DISABLED\_BY\_DEFAULT in Chromium master.

## [Feb 10, 2020](#feb-10-2020)

The Chrome
[policies](/administrators/policy-list-3/cookie-legacy-samesite-policies)
LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabledForDomainList and
LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabled which revert to the legacy cookie behavior
for managed Chrome and ChromeOS instances will be available ~~for at least 12
months after the release of Chrome 80 stable~~ (**Edit - May 29, 2020**: until
at least July 14, 2021). We will be monitoring feedback about these policies and
will provide updates on their lifetime as appropriate.

## [Nov 21, 2019](#nov-21-2019)

Starting in Canary version **80.0.3975.0**, the Lax+POST temporary mitigation
can be disabled for testing purposes using the new flag
--enable-features=SameSiteDefaultChecksMethodRigorously to allow testing of
sites and services in the eventual end state of the feature where the mitigation
has been removed. (Note that to enable multiple features, you must append the
feature name to the comma-separated list of params for the --enable-features
flag. Do not use multiple separate --enable-features flags.)

In addition, there is [a bug](https://crbug.com/1027318) affecting Chrome 78-79
which causes spurious SameSite warning messages to be emitted to the console
when the user has cookies for other domains on the same site as a resource
fetched in a cross-site context. We apologize for the confusion. This will be
fixed in Chrome 80.

## [Nov 1, 2019](#nov-1-2019)

Clearing up some misconceptions and providing additional information about "Lax

* POST" (which is mentioned briefly on the [chromestatus.com
  page](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5088147346030592)):

* "Lax + POST" does *not* result in the legacy behavior (i.e. the old
  behavior before the SameSite changes).
* “Lax + POST” is an intervention for Lax-by-default cookies (cookies
  that don’t specify a `SameSite` attribute) which allows these
  cookies to be sent on top-level cross-site POST requests if they are
  at most 2 minutes old. “Normal” Lax cookies are not sent on
  cross-site POST requests (or any other cross-site requests with a
  non-idempotent HTTP method such as PUT). This intervention was put
  in place to mitigate breakage to some POST-based login flows.
* If “Lax + POST” is affecting the cookies you are testing (i.e. if
  your cookie would have been excluded if not for the "+ POST"
  behavior due to its age), you will see a message in the DevTools
  console about the 2 minute threshold. This can be useful for
  debugging.
* For integration testing (if your cookie needs to be sent on
  cross-site POST requests), we recommend test cases with cookie age
  both below and above the threshold. For this, there is a
  command-line flag --enable-features=ShortLaxAllowUnsafeThreshold,
  which will lower the 2 minute threshold to 10 seconds, so that your
  test doesn’t have to wait for 2 whole minutes. This flag is
  available in Chrome 79.0.3945.16 and newer. (Note that if you are
  also using other --enable-features flags such as
  --enable-features=SameSiteByDefaultCookies,CookiesWithoutSameSiteMustBeSecure,
  you must append the feature name to the comma-separated list rather
  than use multiple --enable-features flags.)
* Note that the 2-minute window for "Lax+POST" is a temporary
  intervention and will be removed at some point in the future (some
  time after the Stable launch of Chrome 80), at which point cookies
  involved in these flows will require `SameSite=None` and
  `Secure` even if under 2 minutes old.

## [Oct 2, 2019](#oct-2-2019)

In response to feedback from users and enterprise customers, we are deferring
the experimental Beta launch of the "SameSite=Lax by Default" and "SameSite=None
requires Secure" features from Chrome 78 Beta to Chrome 79 Beta. Users of Chrome
78 Beta will not experience any change or disruption in cookie behavior.

When the experiment is launched to Chrome 79 Beta users, domain-joined or
enterprise-registered machines will be included in the experiment. Instead of
excluding them from the experiment entirely, policies will be made available in
Chrome 79 to manage the experimental behavior. This will provide extra time for
administrators to configure and test the policies in advance of the Stable
launch in Chrome 80.

One policy will allow administrators to specify a list of domains on which
cookies should be handled according to the legacy behavior
(LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabledForDomainList), and a second policy will
provide the option to set the global default to legacy SameSite behavior for all
cookies (LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabled). More details about these policies
will follow in future enterprise release notes before the Chrome 79 release.

These features will still become the default behavior on Stable starting in
Chrome 80.

## [Sep 30, 2019](#sep-30-2019)

**Note (Jan 30, 2020): Check out our more detailed [tips for testing and
debugging](/updates/same-site/test-debug).**

To test whether your sites may be affected by the SameSite changes:

```
Go to chrome://flags and enable #same-site-by-default-cookies and
#cookies-without-same-site-must-be-secure. Restart the browser for the
changes to take effect.

Test your sites, with a focus on anything involving federated login flows,
multiple domains, or cross-site embedded content. Note that, because of the
2 minute time threshold for the "Lax+POST" intervention, for any flows
involving POST requests, you may want to test with and without a long (&gt;
2 minute) delay.

If your site stops working:

*   Try turning off #cookies-without-same-site-must-be-secure. If
            this fixes the issue, you need to set \`Secure\` on any
            \`SameSite=None\` cookies your site may be relying upon. (This
            may require upgrading HTTP sites to HTTPS.)
*   Try turning off both flags. If this fixes the issue, you need to
            identify the cookies being accessed in a cross-site context and
            apply the attributes \`SameSite=None\` and \`Secure\` to them.
            See ["SameSite cookies
            explained"](https://web.dev/samesite-cookies-explained/) for
            more information. If you are not the developer of the site,
            please reach out to the developer and/or vendor who authored the
            site.
*   For flows involving POST requests, if a short delay (&lt; 2
            minutes) works but a long delay (&gt; 2 minutes) does not work,
            you will also need to add \`SameSite=None\` and \`Secure\` to
            the relevant cookies if the operation in question may take
            longer than 2 minutes. Note that the 2-minute window for
            "Lax+POST" is a temporary intervention and will be removed at
            some point in the future (some time after the Stable launch of
            Chrome 80), at which point cookies involved in these flows will
            require \`SameSite=None\` and \`Secure\` even if under 2
            minutes.

```

If you are an IT administrator managing a Chrome deployment for your
organization, policies will temporarily be made available to maintain Chrome's
existing behavior for your users. This is to give enterprises extra time to roll
out and test changes. You have two options:

1. (Recommended) Apply the
   LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabledForDomainList policy to the
   specific domains on which cookies require legacy behavior.
2. (Less recommended due to security and privacy implications) Apply
   the LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabled policy to revert all cookies
   to legacy behavior.

These policies will be made available starting in ~~Chrome 80~~. Chrome 79.
**(See Oct 2, 2019 update.)**

## [Sep 26, 2019](#sep-26-2019)

Starting in Chrome 80, cookies that do not specify a SameSite attribute will be
treated as if they were SameSite=Lax with the additional behavior that they will
still be included in [POST
requests](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5088147346030592) to ease the
transition for existing sites. Cookies that still need to be delivered in a
cross-site context can explicitly request SameSite=None, and must also be marked
Secure and delivered over HTTPS. We will provide policies if you need to
configure Chrome Browser to temporarily revert to legacy SameSite behavior.

**This section is obsolete: See Oct 2, 2019 update.**

~~While experiments for this change will be rolling out to Chrome 78 Beta users,
the Beta SameSite experiment rollout will exclude Windows and Mac devices that
are joined to a domain and Chrome OS devices that are enterprise-registered.
Beta users on Linux, iOS, Android, and Android Webview will also not be affected
by the experiments at this time. For Chrome Beta users unaffected by the
experiments, there should be no change in behavior to login services or embedded
content.~~

The new SameSite rules will become the default behavior on Stable in Chrome 80,
but the changes will be limited to pre-Stable versions of Chrome until then.

Policies to manage this behavior will be made available when it becomes the
default behavior for Chrome 80. One policy will allow administrators to specify
a list of domains on which cookies should be handled according to the legacy
behavior, and second policy will provide the option to set the global default to
legacy SameSite behavior for all cookies. More details about these policies will
follow in future enterprise release notes before the Chrome 80 release.

Chrome continues to engage with members of the web community and welcomes input
on these SameSite changes via our forum:
<https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!forum/blink-dev>

# Firefox rolls out Total Cookie Protection by default to more users worldwide

![calendar](https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/themes/foxtail/assets/images/icons/calendar.svg)
June 14, 2022

![author](https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/themes/foxtail/assets/images/icons/author.svg)

*Updated Aug. 28, 2024*.

## Take back your privacy

**Firefox is rolling out Total Cookie Protection by default to more Firefox users worldwide, making Firefox the most private and secure major browser available across Windows, Mac, Linux and Android.** [Total Cookie Protection](https://blog.mozilla.org/products/firefox/firefox-tips/internet-safety-for-families-total-cookie-protection/) is Firefox’s strongest privacy protection to date, confining cookies to the site where they were created, thus preventing tracking companies from using these cookies to track your browsing from site to site.

Whether it’s [applying for a student loan](https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/04/28/applied-for-student-aid-online-facebook-saw-you), [seeking treatment or advice through a health site](https://www.wired.com/story/health-site-ad-tracking/), or [browsing an online dating app](https://www.wsj.com/articles/grindr-user-data-has-been-for-sale-for-years-11651492800?mod=hp_lead_pos4), massive amounts of your personal information is online — and this data is leaking all over the web. The hyper-specific-to-you ads you so often see online are made possible by cookies that are used to track your behavior across sites and build an extremely sophisticated profile of who you are.

[Stories](https://www.vox.com/recode/22587248/grindr-app-location-data-outed-priest-jeffrey-burrill-pillar-data-harvesting) (including an excellent [Last Week Tonight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqn3gR1WTcA&ab_channel=LastWeekTonight) episode) have shown how robust, yet under-the-radar, the data selling economy is and how easy it is for anyone to buy your data, combine it with more data about you and use it for a variety of purposes, even beyond advertising.

It’s an alarming reality — the possibility that your every move online is being watched, tracked and shared — and one that’s antithetical to the open web we at Mozilla have strived to build. That’s why we developed Total Cookie Protection to help keep you safe online.

## **What is Total Cookie Protection?**

Total Cookie Protection offers strong protections against tracking without affecting your browsing experience.

Total Cookie Protection stops cookies from tracking you around the web.

Total Cookie Protection works by creating a separate “cookie jar” for each website you visit. Instead of allowing trackers to link up your behavior on multiple sites, they just get to see behavior on individual sites. Any time a website, or [third-party content](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/third-party-cookies-firefox-tracking-protection#:~:text=Third%2Dparty%20cookies%20are%20cookies,considered%20a%20third%2Dparty%20cookie.) embedded in a website, deposits a cookie in your browser, that cookie is confined to the cookie jar assigned to *only* that website. No other websites can reach into the cookie jars that don’t belong to them and find out what the other websites’ cookies know about you — giving you freedom from invasive ads and reducing the amount of information companies gather about you.

This approach strikes the balance between eliminating the worst privacy properties of third-party cookies – in particular the ability to track you – and allowing those cookies to fulfill their less invasive use cases (e.g. to provide accurate analytics). With Total Cookie Protection in Firefox, people can enjoy better privacy andhave the great browsing experience they’ve come to expect.

Total Cookie Protection offers additional privacy protections beyond those provided by our existing anti-tracking features. Enhanced Tracking Protection (ETP), which we launched in 2018, works by blocking trackers based on a maintained list. If a party is on that list, they lose the ability to use third-party cookies. ETP was a huge privacy win for Firefox users, but we’ve known this approach has some shortcomings. If a tracker for some reason isn’t on that list, they can still track users and violate their privacy. And if an attacker wants to thwart ETP, they can set up a new tracking domain that isn’t on the list. Total Cookie Protection avoids these problems by restricting the functionality for **all** cookies, not just for those on a defined list.

## **A culmination of years of anti-tracking work**

Total Cookie Protection is the culmination of years of work to fight the privacy catastrophe that stems from online trackers. We first began to block tracking in 2015 with the release of [Tracking Protection](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-now-offers-a-more-private-browsing-experience/), a feature people could turn on by going into Private Browsing mode. We recognized at that time that browser makers couldn’t just sit back and let their users be abused. In 2018, we introduced [Enhanced Tracking Protection](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/latest-firefox-rolls-out-enhanced-tracking-protection/) and turned it on **by default** for all Firefox users in 2019, reflecting our commitment to actively protect our users rather than expect them to protect themselves. Since then, we have continued to make progress towards blocking trackers and ending cross-site tracking by introducing protections against [fingerprinting](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/features/block-fingerprinting/) and [supercookies](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/01/26/supercookie-protections/).

The release of Total Cookie Protection is the result of experimentation and feature testing, first in [ETP Strict Mode](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/02/23/total-cookie-protection/) and [Private Browsing](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/06/01/total-cookie-protection-in-private-browsing/) windows, then in [Firefox Focus](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/new-privacy-protection-for-firefox-focus-on-android/#:~:text=Focus%20on%20Android.-,Total%20Cookie%20Protection%20works%20by%20maintaining%20a%20separate%20%E2%80%9Ccookie%20jar,jar%20assigned%20to%20that%20website.) earlier this year. We’re now making it a default feature for **all** Firefox desktop users worldwide.

Our long history of fighting online tracking manifests itself in our advocacy to [policy](https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2019/12/31/bringing-californias-privacy-law-to-all-firefox-users-in-2020/) [makers](https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2017/05/09/eprivacy/) and other [tech](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/open-letter-to-venmo-make-privacy-the-default/) [companies](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/the-bug-in-apples-latest-marketing-campaign/) to reinforce their own privacy protections. We also push to make [privacy an industry priority](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/privacy-preserving-attribution-for-advertising/) through our efforts in industry [standards](https://www.w3.org/community/patcg/) bodies when shaping the future of online advertising. Furthermore, we created [the Privacy Not Included guide](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/about/why/) to simplify the very complicated privacy landscape and help consumers shop smarter and safer for products that connect to the internet.

Over more than a decade, Mozilla has proudly been leading the fight to build a more private internet. While bringing Total Cookie Protection to more Firefox users has been one significant step in this journey, we have still kept our sights on an even safer, even better internet. And starting in 2024, all our users can look forward to [Firefox blocking even more third party cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/goodbye-third-party-cookies/). That’s right; we are taking big swings to adopt new cookie partitioning and clearing mechanisms so that users can browse with fewer cookies that won’t stick around as long and will result in an even better browsing experience. Just another step on our road towards creating a better internet where your privacy is not optional.

Take back your privacy by [downloading Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) today.
