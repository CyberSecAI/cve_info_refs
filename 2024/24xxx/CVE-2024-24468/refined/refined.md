Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2024-24468:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application lacks sufficient CSRF protection on the `/core/tools/add_customblock.php` endpoint.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can trick a logged-in user into making unauthorized requests to the server. In this specific case, the attacker can add custom blocks to the CMS, potentially injecting malicious code or altering content.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted HTML page that sends a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint (`/core/tools/add_customblock.php`). This page could be hosted on a separate website and when a logged-in user visits this page the malicious request is automatically triggered.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to lure a logged-in user of the vulnerable flusity-CMS into visiting a malicious website controlled by the attacker or any other method of tricking the user into submitting the crafted request. The attacker does not need to have access to the CMS server itself, they just need to be able to trick a user into submitting a malicious request.

**Additional Details:**
The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) HTML code shows how an attacker can create a form that, when submitted by a logged-in user, adds a custom block to the CMS.
The PoC includes hidden fields to specify the action (`mode=create`), the place for the block (`customblock_place_id=8`), and the content of the block (`customblock_html_code=123`).
The content also confirms that the attack is successful.
