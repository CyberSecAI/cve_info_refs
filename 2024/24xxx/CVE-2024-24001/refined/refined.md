The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in jshERP v3.3, specifically four SQL injection vulnerabilities and one file upload vulnerability, as reported in GitHub issue #99.

**SQL Injection Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Root Cause:** Inadequate input sanitization and filtering of user-supplied parameters before being used in SQL queries. The application attempts to filter out malicious SQL keywords, but this filter can be bypassed using techniques like inserting the filter keywords in a repeated manner (e.g., "a andnd s selectelect").
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Insufficient input validation/sanitization.
    *   Use of a vulnerable regular expression to sanitize SQL keywords.
    *   Direct concatenation of user-supplied input in SQL queries.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    *   Data breaches.
    *   Data modification or deletion.
    *   Bypassing authentication mechanisms.
    *   Denial of service.
*  **Attack Vectors:** HTTP GET requests with crafted parameters.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints of the application. They do not need any special permissions or a privileged position, just the ability to interact with the web application.

**Specific vulnerable endpoints and example injection points:**

*   `/jshERP-boot/material/getListWithStock` with injection in `column` parameter.
*   `/jshERP-boot/depotHead/findInOutDetail` with injection in `column` parameter.
*   `/jshERP-boot/depotHead/findInOutMaterialCount` with injection in `column` parameter.
*   `/jshERP-boot/depotHead/findAllocationDetail` with injection in `column` parameter.

**File Upload Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of proper filename sanitization during file uploads. Specifically, there is no strong checksum for filenames, and the `biz` parameter can be used to manipulate the file path allowing to write to arbitrary locations.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Lack of proper input sanitization of `biz` parameter.
    *   Insufficient file path validation.
    *   No checks to prevent path traversal.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can upload malicious files (e.g., JSP files) to arbitrary locations on the server, leading to:
    *   Remote code execution.
    *   Complete compromise of the server.
*   **Attack Vectors:** HTTP POST request to `/jshERP-boot/systemConfig/upload` with manipulated `biz` parameter and a malicious file in the `file` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable file upload endpoint of the application, and needs to have knowledge of server's directory structure or can deduce it through other vulnerabilities to place the malicious files in a location where they can be executed.

**Specific vulnerable endpoint and example of injection point:**

*   `/jshERP-boot/systemConfig/upload` with path traversal through `biz` parameter.
