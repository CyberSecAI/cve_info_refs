- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Memory corruption occurs while parsing specially crafted Catia MODEL files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption (CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: By enticing a user to open a malicious Catia MODEL file using Simcenter Femap.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a malicious Catia MODEL file. The user must then open this malicious file with Simcenter Femap.
