- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The module "Multilingual and Multistore Sitemap Pro â€“ SEO" (lgsitemaps) for PrestaShop lacked proper input sanitization and path control, allowing path traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory (CWE-22), lack of permissions control, and lack of control in the path name construction.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A guest user could perform a path traversal attack to download any XML files on the server, potentially including sensitive configuration files like `config.xml`, even those under `.htaccess`/WAF protection. This leads to potential unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack via HTTP requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No authentication is required. An attacker can perform the exploit as a guest user with no special privileges. The attacker needs to send a crafted request containing the path traversal sequence.
