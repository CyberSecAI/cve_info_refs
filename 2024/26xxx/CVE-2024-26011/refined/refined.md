- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper authentication in the `fgfmd` daemon.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  CWE-287 Improper Authentication. The `fgfmd` daemon does not properly authenticate packets in tunnels between a FortiManager and managed devices, allowing for injection of packets.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can inject packets into established tunnels. However, they cannot receive responses, effectively limiting the impact to injection. The CVSS score indicates a medium severity.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack where an unauthenticated attacker injects packets into established tunnels between a FortiManager and managed devices.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to inject packets into the network communication between a FortiManager and the targeted device. No user interaction or special privileges are required. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
