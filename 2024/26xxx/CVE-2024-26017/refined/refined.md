- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Uncontrolled search path in some Intel Rendering Toolkit software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: The software does not properly control the paths it searches for resources, which can be exploited by an attacker.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user can potentially escalate their privileges via local access.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access by an authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have local access and be an authenticated user on the system where the vulnerable software is installed. They also need to have user interaction.
