{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `replace_emoji_with_text` function in `ui_util.ts` was vulnerable to HTML injection because it directly used the text content of the emoji elements.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper neutralization of input during web page generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the application, potentially leading to actions such as session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a message with a malicious emoji, the attacker can exploit the vulnerable `replace_emoji_with_text` function. When this message is processed and displayed, the injected code is executed by the victim's browser.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send messages that will be processed by the vulnerable `replace_emoji_with_text` function. This could involve sending a direct message or posting a message in a channel the victim has access to."
