Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-36613

**Product:** FFmpeg

**Version:** n6.1.1

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Integer overflow in the DXA demuxer within the libavformat library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability arises during the calculation of `c->bpc` (bytes per chunk) in the `dxa_read_header` function. Specifically, the line `c->bpc = ((c->bpc + ast->codecpar->block_align - 1) / ast->codecpar->block_align) * ast->codecpar->block_align;` is vulnerable to an integer overflow.
- The check `if (c->bpc > INT_MAX - ast->codecpar->block_align + 1)` which is meant to prevent an overflow in a later calculation is not sufficient to prevent an overflow in the calculation itself.
- An attacker can manipulate the `fsize` and `block_align` parameters to cause an integer overflow during the `c->bpc` calculation. This could lead to an out-of-bounds memory access later in the demuxer process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to the integer overflow and subsequent undefined behavior. The undefined behavior could include out-of-bounds memory access, which can lead to crashes or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves crafting a malicious DXA file with specific parameters that trigger the integer overflow.
- The vulnerability is triggered during the demuxing process, specifically when the `dxa_read_header` function is called to parse the header of the malicious DXA file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious crafted DXA file to a vulnerable system using the affected FFmpeg version.
- The attacker needs no special privileges.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided patch in the commit `50d8e4f27398fd5778485a827d7a2817921f8540` fixes the vulnerability by reordering the operations around block alignment. This resolves the integer overflow issue. The fix is to change `c->bpc = ((c->bpc + ast->codecpar->block_align - 1) / ast->codecpar->block_align) * ast->codecpar->block_align;` to `c->bpc = ((c->bpc - 1 + ast->codecpar->block_align) / ast->codecpar->block_align) * ast->codecpar->block_align;`.
- The vulnerability was found by a continuous fuzzing process.
