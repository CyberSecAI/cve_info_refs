Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36671:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content explicitly mentions CVE-2024-36671 and links to relevant discussions and commits within the `nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware` repository. This confirms that the content is directly related to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

   - **Root Cause:** Integer overflow in the `getnum` function within `app/modules/struct.c`. This function processes format strings for packing data, and a large format string can lead to an integer overflow when calculating the size of data to be processed.
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Integer overflow, potentially leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.
   - **Impact of Exploitation:**
      - A successful exploit could cause a crash due to the buffer overflow.
      - It could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the overflowed data. The issue description states it is a stack-based buffer overflow.
      - The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" with a CVSS score of 9.8, indicating a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
   - **Attack Vectors:** Network-based attacks.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
      - The attacker needs to send crafted data that includes a large format string to trigger the integer overflow, making the overflow happen in the struct.pack function.
      - No privileges or user interaction are required.

**3. Technical Details:**

   - The vulnerability is located in the `getnum` function in `app/modules/struct.c`.
   - The vulnerability can be triggered by using `struct.pack` with a large format string.
   - The issue was identified and fixed in the following pull requests:
      - [#3633](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware/pull/3633) (Fix potential integer overflow in getnum)
      - [#3634](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware/pull/3634) (Fix potential integer overflow in getnum and fix the negation overflow in lua)

**4. Additional Information:**

   - The issue was initially reported in issue [#3626](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware/issues/3626).
   - The fix was merged into the `dev` branch via PR #3633 and `dev-esp32` branch via PR #3634, and was also included in release `v3.0.0-release_20240225` as mentioned in the advisory.
   - The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 (Critical) with metrics: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`.
   -  The provided content includes the commit `193fe3593eb1537667179089535cdb7457327887` which fixed some bugs and problems in the gossip module, which was also merged into the release including this fix.
   - There's a mention of a related negation overflow issue that was fixed in PR #3634.

**Summary of Extracted Information:**

-   **Vulnerability:** Integer overflow in `getnum` function in `app/modules/struct.c`, leading to stack-based buffer overflow
-   **Root Cause:**  Lack of bounds checking in `getnum` when processing format strings in `struct.pack` function
-   **Impact:** Potential crash, arbitrary code execution
-  **Attack Vector:** Network (crafted data with large format strings)
-   **Attacker Requirements:** No special privileges or user interaction required
-   **Affected Versions:** nodemcu before v3.0.0-release_20240225
-   **Fix:** Merged via pull requests #3633 and #3634.
