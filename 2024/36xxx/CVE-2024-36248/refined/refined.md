## CVE-2024-36248

Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Hardcoded Google API keys within the main program of the Sharp multi-function printers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Insecure storage of private API keys directly within the firmware.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially utilize the hardcoded Google API keys to:
    - Receive traffic from the printers by using these domains since they are no longer used by Sharp and are free for use.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the printer to leverage the hardcoded keys.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to reverse engineer the firmware to discover the hardcoded keys.

**Additional Details:**
- The specific Googleusercontent.com domains identified are:
