- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Exposure of sensitive system information to an unauthorized control sphere. Specifically, the encrypted passwords of other administrators are accessible through the "Log Access Event" logs page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-497, Information disclosure. The vulnerability lies in the fact that password hashes of administrators are exposed in the logs, which are accessible to other authenticated administrators with read-only access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated attacker with read-only access can obtain the encrypted password hashes of other administrators. Although the passwords are encrypted, this exposure can be used in further attacks to escalate privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated attacker with read-only admin access navigates to the "Log Access Event" page within the FortiWeb GUI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated user with read-only administrator access to FortiWeb.
