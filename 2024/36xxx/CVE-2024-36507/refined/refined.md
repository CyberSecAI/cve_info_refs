- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An untrusted search path vulnerability (CWE-426) exists in FortiClient Windows. This means that when the FortiClient online installer loads, it searches for required DLL files in locations that an attacker might control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** DLL hijacking, an untrusted search path vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code by placing a malicious DLL in a location where the FortiClient installer will load it. This can lead to unauthorized code execution on the victim's machine.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL file in a location that the FortiClient installer searches before finding the legitimate DLL. This requires social engineering to trick a user into running the modified installer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access and the ability to place a malicious DLL in a location that is searched by the FortiClient installer. They must also trick the user into running the malicious installer.
