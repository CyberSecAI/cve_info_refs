      "root_cause": "The `FormLoginAuthenticator` component in Symfony failed to adequately handle cases where the username or password field of a login request is empty.",

        "Improper Authentication",
        "CWE-287 Improper Authentication",
        "CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization"
      ],
      "impact": "This flaw could lead to various security risks, including improper authentication logic handling or denial of service. Specifically, by submitting a login request with an empty username or password, an attacker could bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access, or cause a denial of service.",

       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any privileges or user interaction to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker can be on the adjacent or remote network."
    },
    "additional_details": "The provided information suggests that the vulnerability is related to the `FormLoginAuthenticator` component not properly handling empty username or password fields, which was not the case. This is further explained in the different sources which show the original advisory, and its withdrawal after further analysis. The patch provided is also related to making sure empty values for username and password return a 400, instead of allowing access to the application."
