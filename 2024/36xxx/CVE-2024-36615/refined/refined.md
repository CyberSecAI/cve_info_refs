Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36615:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the VP9 decoder within FFmpeg. When outputting a "show-existing frame," the decoder creates a reference to the existing frame and returns it to the caller immediately, without ensuring the frame has completed decoding. In multithreaded scenarios, this can lead to a race condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Data Race:**  A data race occurs when video encoding parameters are exported as side data. This side data is attached to the source `AVFrame` at the end of the actual frame decoding within the decoder thread. Simultaneously, the `av_frame_ref()` function in the output thread reads this data. Without proper synchronization, this results in a data race.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unspecified impact:** The provided text does not specify the direct impact of the race condition, only that a data race can occur. It is likely that this could lead to incorrect or corrupted data being read from the side data, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously crafted video:** A specially crafted VP9 video could trigger the vulnerable code path.
- **Video processing with side data export:** Exploitation requires the user to export video encoding parameters while using the VP9 decoder.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need the ability to provide input video to a system using FFmpeg.
- They would need to create a specific VP9 video that triggers a "show-existing frame" and also enable the export of video encoding parameters.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit link (https://github.com/ffmpeg/ffmpeg/commit/0ba058579f332b3060d8470a04ddd3fbf305be61) resolves the issue by ensuring that the decoder thread waits for the frame to be output before continuing, thus preventing the race condition.
- The vulnerability is specifically triggered in cases when the `venc_data_dump` tool is used with a specific test file from the FATE-suite (`vp90-2-10-show-existing-frame.webm`).
- The fix involves making the decoder wait until the frame is output, thereby synchronizing the access to the side data.
