- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `atob` function in "Zabbix JS" can be used to create strings with arbitrary content.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the ability to use these arbitrary strings created by `atob` to access internal properties of objects within Zabbix JS.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The provided information does not provide explicit details on the impact. However, being able to access internal properties could allow for various malicious activities depending on the nature of the exposed properties.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited using the `atob` function within Zabbix JS, manipulating it to construct strings that can then be used to access internal object properties.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to execute javascript within the Zabbix environment. This could include access to Zabbix frontend or any way to inject javascript that uses this functionality.
