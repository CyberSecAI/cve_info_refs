The provided content describes a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability in OpenCart v4.0.2.3. This vulnerability is related to CVE-2024-40420, not CVE-2024-36694. Therefore, I will respond with the information for CVE-2024-40420.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from the lack of template sandboxing and insufficient blacklisting of potentially dangerous template content within the theme editor functionality of OpenCart. The application uses the Twig template engine, but does not properly restrict the use of its features, allowing users to inject arbitrary template code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):**  User-supplied input in the theme editor is directly processed by the Twig template engine without adequate sanitization or restrictions.
*   **Lack of Sandboxing:** The Twig environment isn't configured with a sandbox, which would prevent the execution of dangerous functions and operations.
*   **Insufficient Blacklisting:** There is a failure to effectively blacklist dangerous keywords/functions that allow the execution of system commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the server by injecting malicious Twig template code.
*   **Complete System Compromise:**  Successful exploitation could lead to full control of the webserver and associated data.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Theme Editor:** An authenticated administrator can access the theme editor and add a new theme, or edit an existing template.
*   **Template Injection:** By inserting malicious Twig syntax into the template content, an attacker can inject arbitrary code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Authenticated Admin Access:** The attacker needs to have valid administrator credentials to access the theme editor.
*   **Knowledge of Twig Syntax:** The attacker should be familiar with Twig template syntax and be aware of potentially dangerous functions.

In summary, the content describes an exploitable vulnerability in OpenCart that allows a malicious administrator to inject server-side template code, leading to remote code execution.
