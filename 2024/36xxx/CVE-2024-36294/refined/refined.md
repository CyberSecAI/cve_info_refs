Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2024-36294:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is **insecure inherited permissions** in some IntelÂ® Driver & Support Assistant (DSA) software versions prior to 24.3.26.8.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Inherited Permissions:** The software doesn't properly manage permissions, allowing an authenticated user to potentially leverage this to gain elevated privileges. This suggests that the permissions assigned to files or directories used by the DSA software are too broad, allowing a lower-privileged user to modify them or use them in unintended ways.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Escalation of Privilege:** A successful exploit can enable an authenticated user to gain higher privileges on the system. This could allow the attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code, install malware, modify system settings, access sensitive data, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have access to the target system. This could be achieved by already having a low-privilege account on the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system. This means that the attacker already has some form of access, such as a user account.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system running the vulnerable software.
*   **User Interaction:** The CVSS score implies that some level of user interaction is required for successful exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Intel DSA software versions before 24.3.26.8.
*   Intel recommends updating to version 24.3.26.8 or later to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   The report was made by @sim0nsecurity

**Summary of CVSS Scores:**

*   **CVSS v3.1:**
    *   Base Score: 6.7 (Medium)
    *   Vector: AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (Local Access, High Attack Complexity, Low Privileges Required, User Interaction Required, Unchanged Scope, High Confidentiality Impact, High Integrity Impact, High Availability Impact)

*   **CVSS v4.0:**
    *   Base Score: 5.4 (Medium)
    *   Vector: AV:L/AC:H/AT:P/PR:L/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N (Local Access, High Attack Complexity, Attack Vector is Physical, Low Privileges Required, User Interaction is Active, High Confidentiality Impact, High Integrity Impact, High Availability Impact, Scope is Unchanged, No impact on System Integrity, No Impact on System Availability)
