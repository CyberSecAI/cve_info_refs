Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36624:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how the `construct_copy_div` function in `copy_and_paste.js` constructs the HTML content for copying multiple messages. Specifically, it was prepending the sender's name to the message content using `.prepend()`, which directly inserts the provided HTML. The message content itself was also not being sanitized prior to appending to the div via `$div.append($content)`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. By injecting malicious HTML content into a message, an attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of another user's browser when that user copies the message via the copy functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into a message. When another user copies the crafted message using the copy functionality, the injected script would execute within their browser session.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Through JavaScript execution, the attacker could potentially steal session cookies or other sensitive data, compromising the user's account.
*   **Malicious Actions:** An attacker could use the XSS vulnerability to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the user, redirect them to malicious websites, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Message Injection:** The attacker must craft a malicious message containing HTML code that will be interpreted as JavaScript in a browser when copied through the described copy feature.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Send Messages:** The attacker needs to be able to send messages within the Zulip application to inject the malicious HTML content.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The victim has to copy a message (or selection of messages) containing the injected HTML through the built-in copy functionality within Zulip.

**Additional Details**
The provided patch addresses the vulnerability by changing how the sender's name is added to the message content. Instead of using `$content.first().prepend(message.sender_full_name + ": ");`, which directly injects HTML, the patch uses `$content.first().prepend($("<span>").text(message.sender_full_name + ": ").contents());`.  This change ensures that the sender's name is treated as plain text, preventing the execution of injected HTML. The message content, while not sanitized, is not vulnerable unless the user selects a range within a single message and utilizes the browsers default copy command.
