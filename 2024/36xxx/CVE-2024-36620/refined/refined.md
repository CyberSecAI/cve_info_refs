Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36620:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference in the `ImageHistory` function within the `daemon/images/image_history.go` file. Specifically, the `h.Created` field within the image history struct could be nil, leading to a dereference when calling `.Unix()` on it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The code directly accesses the `h.Created` field without checking if it is nil. If `h.Created` is `nil`, then calling `h.Created.Unix()` will trigger a null pointer dereference.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A NULL pointer dereference typically leads to a crash of the affected process, potentially causing a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `ImageHistory` function is called with an image where a history item has a `nil` value for `Created`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to trigger the `ImageHistory` function on a crafted image or manipulate the image history data such that `h.Created` becomes nil.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerable code was introduced in PR [#45504](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/45504) and was present in versions v25.0.0-beta.1 to v26.0.2.
- The fix involves adding a check to see if `h.Created` is nil, and if so, assigning a default value of 0 to the created timestamp, preventing the null pointer dereference.
