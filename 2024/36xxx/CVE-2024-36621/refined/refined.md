Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-36621:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a race condition in the `EnsureLayer` function within `builder/builder-next/adapters/snapshot/layer.go`. This occurs when the function is called concurrently by multiple builds.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Race Condition:** Concurrent calls to `EnsureLayer` can lead to a data race when writing to the `refs` map. Specifically, a layer might be added to the map when it already exists.
*   **Incorrect Reference Counting:** The race condition can cause the reference count for layers to become mixed up, leading to a situation where only one of the duplicated layers is released during cleanup.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Resource Leaks/Exhaustion:** The incorrect reference counting leads to unreleased resources, potentially causing memory leaks and resource exhaustion. This could degrade performance or even lead to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is triggering concurrent builds that call the `EnsureLayer` function. This could be achieved by initiating multiple image builds simultaneously.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to trigger concurrent image builds using the affected version of `moby`.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is located in `moby` version `v25.0.5`.
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-366: Race Condition within a Thread.
*   The patch for this vulnerability is available at: `https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/37545cc644344dcb576cba67eb7b6f51a463d31e`

The provided patch introduces a lock using `s.layerCreateLocker.Lock(key)` to protect the critical section within `EnsureLayer`, preventing the race condition.
