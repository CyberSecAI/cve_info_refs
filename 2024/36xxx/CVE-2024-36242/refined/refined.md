Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-36242:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a protection mechanism failure within the Sub-Page write Permissions (SPP) of certain Intel processors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Failure in the SPP protection mechanism, which is designed to control write access to memory sub-pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Escalation of Privilege:** An attacker can potentially elevate their privileges on the system.
- The CVSS v3.1 score is 8.8 (High) with the vector AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
- The CVSS v4.0 score is 7.3 (High) with the vector CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker requires local access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system.

**Affected Products:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple Intel processor families, including:
    - 3rd Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processor family
    - Intel® Xeon® D Processor
    - 4th Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors (Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze)
    - Intel® Xeon® CPU Max Series processors (High Bandwidth Memory HBM)
    - 4th Generation Intel® Xeon® Edge Enhanced Processors
    - Intel® Xeon® W2400 and W3400 Processors
    - 5th Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors

**Additional Information:**
- Intel has released guidance for Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM, hypervisor) software in virtualized environments. They state that they are not aware of any mainstream VMM software that enables SPP and no action is required in non-virtualized environments or where SPP is not used.
- Intel recommends checking with the system manufacturer or retailer for product updates or patches.
