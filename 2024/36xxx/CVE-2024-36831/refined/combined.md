**Publication ID:** SAP10395

**Resolved Status:** Yes

**Published on:** 24 May 2024 3:13 GMT

**Last updated on:** 24 May 2024 3:13 GMT

**Overview**

The DAP-1520 WiFi Extender, all hardware revisions, are legacy devices which listed below in the table. All hardware revisions, have reached their End of Life ("EOL") /End of Service Life ("EOS") Life-Cycle.  D-Link US recommends D-Link devices that have reached EOL/EOS, to be retired and replaced. Please contact your regional office for recommendations ([LINK](https://us.dlink.com/en/change-region)).

As a  general policy, when products reach EOS/EOL, they can no longer be supported, and all firmware development for these products cease.  **Please read information and recommendations****below**.

**3rd Party Report information**

**Details :** Reported 05/24/2024

Report: [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15CVb7XHIgtfeW1W1pLZJWvlBMYN1rtr75vqZqf1v3Eo/edit#heading=h.bx931c9pkeoj)

**Accused Model**

| **Model** | **Region** | **Hardware Revision** | **End of Service Life** | **Legacy Website** | **Last Updated** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DAP-1520 | All Regions | All H/W Revisions | 03/08/2019 | Yes ([Link](https://legacy.us.dlink.com/pages/product.aspx?id=c9525c84034642bab9e2893b9b6d5134)) | 05/24/2024 |

Recommendation for End of Support /End of Life Products

From time to time, D-Link will decide that some of its products have reached End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life (“EOL”). D-Link may choose to EOS/EOL a product due to evolution of technology, market demands,  new innovations, product efficiencies based on new technologies, or the product matures over time and should be replaced by functionally superior technology.

**For US Consumer**

If a product has reached End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life ("EOL"), there is normally no further extended support or development for it.

Typically for these products, D-Link will be unable to resolve device or firmware issues since all development and customer support has ceased.

D-Link strongly recommends that this product be retired and cautions that any further use of this product may be a risk to devices connected to it. If US consumers continue to use these devices against D-Link's recommendation, please make sure the device has the most recent firmware, make sure you frequently update the device's unique password to access its web-configuration, and always have WIFI encryption enabled with a unique password.

**Regarding the Security Update for Your D-Link Device**

Firmware updates address security vulnerabilities in affected D-Link devices. D-Link strongly recommends all users install the relevant updates and routinely check for further updates.  Once the firmware update is downloaded to your device, ALWAYS validate that the update was successful by comparing the firmware version on your product interface to the firmware update version.

Please note this is beta software, beta firmware, or a hot-fix release which is still undergoing final testing before its official release. The beta software, beta firmware, or hot-fix is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis and the user assumes all risk and liability for use thereof. D-Link does not provide any warranties, whether express or implied, as to the suitability or usability of the beta software, beta firmware or hot-fix release. D-Link will not be liable for any loss, whether such loss is direct, indirect, special, or consequential, suffered by any party as a result of their use of the beta firmware, beta software, or hit-fix release.

NOTE: There are different hardware revisions for our products, so please check your device’s hardware revision before downloading the corresponding firmware update. The hardware revision can be found on the product label next to the serial number or can be found on the device web interface.
