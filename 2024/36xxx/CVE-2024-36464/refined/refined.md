- **Root cause of vulnerability:** When exporting media types in Zabbix, the passwords for those media types are exported in plain text within the YAML file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unencrypted storage of sensitive data (passwords), specifically during export operations.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exposure of sensitive media type passwords, potentially allowing unauthorized access to systems or services configured with those credentials.
- **Attack vectors:** Exporting media types through the Zabbix frontend.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A user with the ability to export media types within the Zabbix frontend.
