Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2024-51736.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant details:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- On Windows, the `Process` class in Symfony could be tricked into executing a malicious `cmd.exe` located in the current working directory instead of the system's `cmd.exe`. This is due to how the `Process` class prepares command arguments on Windows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability is a command execution hijack, where a local attacker can cause arbitrary code to execute.
- The vulnerability stems from the fact that the Process class does not use the absolute path when calling cmd.exe and will use a local `cmd.exe` if available.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution by placing a malicious `cmd.exe` in a directory where a vulnerable application executes.
- This could lead to a complete compromise of the system if the application runs with sufficient privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to be able to place a malicious `cmd.exe` file in a directory where a vulnerable application is running.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to write files to the current working directory of the vulnerable application, or any directory which may be searched for executables.

**Additional Information:**
- The affected versions of `symfony/process` are: <5.4.46, >=6, <6.4.14, and >=7, <7.1.7.
- Patched versions are 5.4.46, 6.4.14, and 7.1.7.
- The fix involves the `Process` class now using the absolute path to `cmd.exe`.
- The vulnerability is assigned a "Low" severity score.
- The CVSS score is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N, with local attack vector.
- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-77 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command).
