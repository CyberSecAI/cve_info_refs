Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the "Name" field when creating or editing firewall rules on the device's web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not sanitize user-supplied input within the "Name" field for firewall rules. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   When a user views the affected page (e.g., the firewall rules list or edits a rule), the stored malicious JavaScript is executed in their browser. This could lead to:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies.
    *   **Data Theft:** Accessing and potentially stealing sensitive information from the router's configuration page.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting the user to malicious websites or attempting to download malware.
    *   **Unauthorized Actions:** Performing actions on behalf of the user, such as changing router settings.
    *   **Defacement:** Changing the look and feel of the router's web interface.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The attack is launched via the router's web interface, specifically through the "Firewall Rule" settings page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** An attacker needs to be authenticated to access the router's web interface. This likely means they need valid admin credentials.
*   **Web Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to access the web interface of the router.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable parameter is `firewallRule_Name_1.1.1.0.0` found on the `/firewall_setting.htm` page.
*   The provided example payload for demonstrating the vulnerability is `<script>alert(1)</script>`.

**Affected Devices/Versions:**

*   TRENDnet TEW-651BR 2.04B1
*   TRENDnet TEW-652BRP 3.04b01
*    TRENDnet TEW-652BRU 1.00b12
