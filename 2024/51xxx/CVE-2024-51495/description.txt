LibreNMS is an open-source, PHP/MySQL/SNMP-based network monitoring system. A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Device Overview page allows authenticated users to inject arbitrary JavaScript through the "overwrite_ip" parameter when editing a device. This vulnerability results in the execution of malicious code when the device overview page is visited, potentially compromising the accounts of other users. This vulnerability is fixed in 24.10.0.
