- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Advanced PDF Generator plugin, in versions 0.4.0 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions, potentially leading to unauthorized changes or data manipulation. The specific impact varies depending on the actions that can be triggered via CSRF.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves crafting malicious requests that are unknowingly triggered by an authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a user with existing authentication/session to unknowingly perform an action via a malicious request. This requires the attacker to be external to the application, since it is based on the user performing a legitimate action.
