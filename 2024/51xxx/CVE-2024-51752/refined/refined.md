Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-51752:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the logging of refresh tokens to the console when the `debug` flag is enabled in the `@workos-inc/authkit-nextjs` package.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Exposure:** The primary weakness is the unintentional logging of sensitive refresh tokens. This exposes these tokens in the console output, which is a security risk.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** If an attacker gains access to the console logs (e.g., through a compromised development environment or a server with exposed logs), they could potentially obtain refresh tokens.
- **Session Hijacking:** With valid refresh tokens, an attacker could potentially obtain new access tokens and hijack user sessions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Log Access:** Attackers would need to gain access to the console logs where the refresh tokens are being printed. This could be achieved through various means, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in the logging infrastructure, accessing a developer's machine, or through misconfigured logging outputs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to be able to view the application's console logs when the `debug` flag is enabled.
-   They need to have a way to intercept or access the log output.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of `@workos-inc/authkit-nextjs` prior to `0.13.2`.
- The issue is fixed in version `0.13.2` of the package.
- The `debug` flag is disabled by default, so this vulnerability only impacts users who have explicitly enabled debugging.
- The severity of this issue is considered low.

The vulnerability is described in the GitHub Security Advisory [GHSA-5wmg-9cvh-qw25](https://github.com/workos/authkit-nextjs/security/advisories/GHSA-5wmg-9cvh-qw25)
