Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization of the `img` parameter in the `customizable.php` file. The value of this parameter is directly passed to the `exec` function without any validation, allowing for command injection.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw.  The application uses user-supplied data to construct a system command. Because the data is not sanitized, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands that will be executed by the system.
    *   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code doesn't sanitize or validate the `img` parameter before using it in the `exec` function.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands with the privileges of the web server process. This can lead to:
    *   Full system compromise
    *   Data exfiltration or manipulation.
    *   Denial of service
    *   Privilege escalation.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted POST request to the `/function/dpi/web_auth/customizable.php` endpoint with a malicious payload in the `img` parameter. The `multipart/form-data` content type is used, which is expected by the target script.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable firewall device.
    *   **Authentication (in some cases):** While the provided exploit does not explicitly demonstrate authentication, it does rely on an active session by setting a cookie, so authentication may be needed to exploit the vulnerability if the target application requires it.

**Additional details:**

*   The specific vulnerable code snippet is within the `customizable.php` file, where the `getVar` function retrieves the `img` parameter value, and this value is later used in an `exec` function without any sanitization.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates how to inject a command that writes the output of `id` command to a file named `1.txt`. The attacker can then access `1.txt` via the web to verify command execution.
*   The vulnerability affects version 7.2.6.120 of the vendor firewall.
