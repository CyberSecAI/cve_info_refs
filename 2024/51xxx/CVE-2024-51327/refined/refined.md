The provided content relates to CVE-2024-51327.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `loginform.php` file of the Travel Management System 1.0. The application directly concatenates user-supplied POST parameters `t1` (username) and `t2` (password) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or using parameterized queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Authentication bypass: An attacker can bypass the login mechanism and gain unauthorized access to the application by injecting malicious SQL code.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to `loginform.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application endpoint, `loginform.php`.
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify the POST parameters `t1` and `t2`.
- Basic knowledge of SQL injection is required.
