Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the direct concatenation of the `dateVal` parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where untrusted user input is embedded directly into an SQL query, allowing for arbitrary SQL execution.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to:
    *   **Data Extraction:** Retrieve all the information stored in the database, including sensitive user data, application configuration, etc.
    *   **Database Modification:** Potentially modify or delete data within the database.
    *   **Further System Compromise:** If the database user has sufficient privileges, it could be used for more extensive system compromise.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP POST request to the `/je/rbac/rbac/loadLoginCount` endpoint.
    *   **`dateVal` Parameter:** The malicious SQL code is injected through the `dateVal` parameter within the POST request body.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target application.
    *   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable `/je/rbac/rbac/loadLoginCount` endpoint and the `dateVal` parameter.

**Summary of the technical details:**
The vulnerability is located in the `loadLoginCount` method within the `je-core-7.2.8.jar` component. The method takes a `queryType` and `dateVal` parameter via an HTTP POST request. When the `queryType` is set to "DAY", it builds an SQL query that contains a LIKE clause where the value of `dateVal` is directly concatenated into the query. Specifically, `sb.append(" \tLOGINLOG_DLRQ LIKE '" + dateVal + "%'  ");` is the vulnerable line. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query by manipulating the `dateVal` parameter. The provided reproduction steps show how an attacker can inject `dateVal=1'+and+1=(updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select+version()),0x7e),1)) and '1'='1` to extract the version information of the database server.
