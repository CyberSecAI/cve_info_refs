Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The WordPress Redirecter Plugin, specifically versions <= 1.0, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The exact mechanism of the XSS is not provided in the content.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Input sanitization or output encoding is likely missing or insufficient in the vulnerable plugin.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts (e.g., redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads) into the website.
- These scripts will execute when visitors access the site.
- This can lead to various consequences such as:
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Displaying unwanted content like advertisements.
  - Potentially stealing user credentials or session data, depending on the injected script.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the plugin's functionality.
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts when using the plugin.
- The injected script is then rendered in the victim's browser when they visit the website.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would likely need to have contributor-level access (as noted in "Required privilege: Contributor").
- The ability to input crafted script within the plugin's context is needed.
