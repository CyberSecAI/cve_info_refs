**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin is susceptible to XSS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Malicious Script Injection: An attacker can inject malicious scripts (e.g., redirects, advertisements, HTML payloads) into the website.
- Arbitrary Code Execution: When a user visits the compromised page, the injected script will be executed within their browser.
- Website Defacement: Injected scripts can be used to modify the appearance of the website.
- Data Theft: Injected scripts could be used to steal user data (e.g. session cookies).
- Phishing:  The injected content could be used in phishing attempts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts via the vulnerable plugin. The specific method of injection is not detailed.
- The attacker would need to be able to input data that is not properly sanitized, allowing the malicious script to persist on the website

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the plugin in a way that allows the injection of malicious code. The required privilege is a 'Contributor', implying that the injected code likely goes through a content submission process.
