Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of input sanitization in the `manage_account.php` page of the Cab Management System. The application does not properly sanitize user-provided input in the "First Name," "Middle Name," and "Last Name" fields before storing it in the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Specifically, a stored XSS vulnerability exists, as the malicious script is saved in the database and executed when other users view the data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable fields. When a user (such as an administrator) views the client details or interacts with the affected data, the injected script executes in the user's browser. This allows the attacker to:
    *   Steal cookies and session tokens, potentially leading to account hijacking.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the victim user.
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   Deface the application.
*   In this specific case, the provided example demonstrates that the attacker can steal the administrator's cookie, highlighting the potential for significant impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The attack is carried out through the web interface of the Cab Management System. Specifically, via the `manage_account.php` page.
*   **Input Fields:** The vulnerable fields are the "First Name", "Middle Name", and "Last Name" input fields in the user account management form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a registered client of the Cab Management System.
*   **Access to User Profile:** The attacker must be able to access the "Manage Account" section to modify their profile details.
*  **No privileged access needed**: The attacker does not need administrative privileges to inject the payload; the XSS payload triggers for admin users when they view the client information.
