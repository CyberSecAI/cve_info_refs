Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the Floodlight controller's vulnerability to forged Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) packets. Malicious hosts can send spoofed LLDP packets with fabricated port information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The Floodlight controller doesn't adequately validate the source of LLDP packets, allowing malicious hosts to inject false port information.
- The controller trusts the information contained in LLDP packets without sufficient verification.
- This allows a malicious host to create fake broadcast ports on switches.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Network Segmentation/Cluster Splitting:** The forged broadcast ports cause the network to split into isolated clusters.
- **Loss of Connectivity:** Hosts within the split clusters are unable to communicate with each other or with the rest of the network.
- **Service Disruption:** This loss of connectivity results in a denial of service for affected hosts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is the network itself, where a malicious host sends crafted LLDP packets.
- Specifically, the attacker must be able to send LLDP packets to the switches.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a host connected to the network managed by the Floodlight controller.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft and send raw LLDP packets.
- The attacker requires the ability to execute code (python script) on their machine.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is demonstrated using a Python script (`poc.py`) that constructs and sends crafted LLDP packets.
- The script iterates through a range of port numbers, creating a different LLDP packet for each. The crafted LLDP packets includes modified fields like  `chassisTlv`, `portTl`, and `dpidTlv` to  inject fabricated port information.
- The script uses the `scapy` library to send the packets.
- The provided `poc.py` targets port numbers in the range \[1,100).
