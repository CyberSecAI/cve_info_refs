- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The yPHPlista plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This occurs due to the lack of proper sanitization and/or encoding of user-supplied input within the plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could inject arbitrary JavaScript into the affected pages, which will be executed when a user visits the website. This can be used to perform actions on behalf of the victim user, redirect them to malicious sites, steal cookies, or perform other harmful activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable by injecting malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have the ability to inject malicious scripts into the website, which could potentially be done through various input points within the vulnerable plugin, with contributor access being sufficient in this case.
