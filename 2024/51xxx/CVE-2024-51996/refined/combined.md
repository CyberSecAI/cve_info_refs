# Authentication Bypass via persisted RememberMe cookie

High

[nicolas-grekas](/nicolas-grekas)
published
GHSA-cg23-qf8f-62rr
Nov 13, 2024

## Package

composer

symfony/security-http
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

>=5.3, <5.4.47
>=6, <6.4.15
>=7, <7.1.8

## Patched versions

5.4.47
6.4.15
7.1.8

## Description

### Description

When consuming a persisted remember-me cookie, Symfony does not check if the username persisted in the database matches the username attached with the cookie, leading to authentication bypass.

### Resolution

The `PersistentRememberMeHandler` class now ensures the submitted username is the cookie owner.

The patch for this issue is available [here](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/81354d392c5f0b7a52bcbd729d6f82501e94135a) for branch 5.4.

### Credits

We would like to thank Moritz Rauch - Pentryx AG for reporting the issue and Jérémy Derussé for providing the fix.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

[@jderusse](https://github.com/jderusse) If I understand correctly, everyone can simply enable "remember me", modify the cookie to add anyone's user id and log into their account?

Sorry, something went wrong.

> everyone can simply enable "remember me"

No, the remember me behavior has to be [enabled in the security configuration](https://symfony.com/doc/current/security/remember_me.html#storing-remember-me-tokens-in-the-database) file. So it's not everyone, but developers.

Also, the vulnerability is only about **persisted** remember me feature (The default remember me implementation uses hash signature verification and is safe)

> modify the cookie to add anyone's user id and log into their account
