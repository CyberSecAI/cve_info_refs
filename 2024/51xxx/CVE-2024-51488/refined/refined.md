- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Inadequate Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) token validation when users delete messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient CSRF token validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can forge CSRF attacks, allowing them to delete messages for any user, including administrators. This compromises the integrity and availability of communications within the platform.
- **Attack vectors**: CSRF attacks are the attack vector. An attacker would need to trick a user into interacting with a malicious request (e.g., via a link or embedded content) that sends a forged request to delete a message.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into making a crafted request to delete a message. They do not need prior access to the user's account, as they are leveraging the user's authenticated session.
