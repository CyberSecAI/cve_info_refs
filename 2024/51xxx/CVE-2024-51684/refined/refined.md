  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The W3P SEO plugin for WordPress lacks proper CSRF protection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. Specific impact varies case by case.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, performs actions within the vulnerable plugin on their behalf.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into initiating a crafted request. This can be achieved by social engineering, such as embedding the malicious request in a link or webpage the user is likely to visit."
