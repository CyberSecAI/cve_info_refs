**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Injected malicious scripts:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious scripts into the plugin's input fields or other areas that the plugin displays unsanitized.
*   **Web Browser:**  The XSS payload is executed in the victim's web browser when they visit the page containing the malicious script, leading to exploitation

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Contributor Role:** The attacker needs at least the contributor role to be able to inject the malicious code.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable input:** The attacker must know how to inject the XSS payload into the plugin.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.5, which is considered low severity.
