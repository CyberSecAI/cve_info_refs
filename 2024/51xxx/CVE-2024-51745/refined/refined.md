  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Wasmtime filesystem sandbox on Windows failed to block access to special device filenames using superscript digits (e.g., COM¹, LPT⁰), allowing bypass of the sandbox.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation allowed access to reserved device names via superscripted characters"
    ],
    "impact": "An untrusted Wasm program could bypass the filesystem sandbox, access devices connected to the computer (modems, printers, etc.) through the special device filenames and potentially gain access to network resources mapped to those devices.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker would need to use an untrusted Wasm program that's given access to any filesystem directory and use the special device filenames with superscript digits to access devices.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to execute untrusted Wasm code within a vulnerable environment and the ability to provide file paths with specially crafted filenames."
