- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application resolves file attachments based on the `path` entry in the `project_has_files` SQLite database. This allows an attacker to manipulate the `path` entry using path traversals to point to arbitrary files on the server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Reading sensitive files from the server, such as configuration files, SSH keys, and source code.
    - Deleting arbitrary files from the server, potentially causing disruption to the system's integrity and availability (e.g., deleting `.htaccess`, `web.config`, or `index.php`).
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can upload a modified SQLite database, which contains manipulated file paths, through the dedicated feature in the application, and then trigger file download or view.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to have admin privileges in the Kanboard application.
    - They need to be able to upload a modified sqlite database file.
