# Panic Vulnerability in loona-hpack

Low

[fasterthanlime](/fasterthanlime)
published
GHSA-7vm6-qwh5-9x44
Nov 3, 2024

## Package

cargo

loona-hpack
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

<= 0.4.2

## Patched versions

0.4.3

## Description

### Summary

`loona-hpack` suffers from the same vulnerability as the original `hpack` as documented in [mlalic/hpack-rs#11](https://github.com/mlalic/hpack-rs/issues/11)

### Details

The original includes a very nice description of the problem, as well as an easy-enough fix for it.

### PoC

The original example pretty much still applies:

```
use loona_hpack::Decoder;

pub fn main() {
    let input = &[0x3f];
    let mut decoder = Decoder::new();
    let _ = decoder.decode(input);
}
```
### Impact

From the original:

`All users who try to decode untrusted input using the Decoder are vulnerable to this exploit. A patched version of the crate is available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/hpack-patched) under the name hpack-patched. See [Cargo's documentation on overriding dependencies](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/overriding-dependencies.html) for more information.`

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-51502

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

### **[sno2](/sno2)** commented [Mar 11, 2024](#issue-2179682680)

| `hpack` has a panic vulnerability in the `Decoder` struct because it does not validate the buffer length is long enough to parse an integer in the `update_max_dynamic_size` function after seeing a `SizeUpdate` field. Here is a minimal reproduction:  ``` use hpack::Decoder;  pub fn main() {   let input = &[0x3f];   let mut decoder = Decoder::new();   let _ = decoder.decode(input); } ```  All users who try to decode untrusted input using the `Decoder` are vulnerable to this exploit. A patched version of the crate is available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/hpack-patched) under the name hpack-patched. See [Cargo's documentation on overriding dependencies](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/overriding-dependencies.html) for more information.   ---   The following Git patch fixes the issue:  ``` diff --git a/src/decoder.rs b/src/decoder.rs index dc4f0c2..55fff45 100644 --- a/src/decoder.rs +++ b/src/decoder.rs @@ -359,7 +359,7 @@ impl<'a> Decoder<'a> {                  },                  FieldRepresentation::SizeUpdate => {                      // Handle the dynamic table size update... -                    self.update_max_dynamic_size(buffer_leftover) +                    self.update_max_dynamic_size(buffer_leftover)?                  }              };   @@ -445,19 +445,16 @@ impl<'a> Decoder<'a> {      /// size of the underlying dynamic table, possibly causing a number of      /// headers to be evicted from it.      /// -    /// Assumes that the first byte in the given buffer `buf` is the first -    /// octet in the `SizeUpdate` block. -    ///      /// Returns the number of octets consumed from the given buffer. -    fn update_max_dynamic_size(&mut self, buf: &[u8]) -> usize { -        let (new_size, consumed) = decode_integer(buf, 5).ok().unwrap(); +    fn update_max_dynamic_size(&mut self, buf: &[u8]) -> Result<usize, DecoderError> { +        let (new_size, consumed) = decode_integer(buf, 5)?;          self.header_table.dynamic_table.set_max_table_size(new_size);            info!("Decoder changed max table size from {} to {}",                self.header_table.dynamic_table.get_size(),                new_size);   -        consumed +        Ok(consumed)      }  } ``` |
