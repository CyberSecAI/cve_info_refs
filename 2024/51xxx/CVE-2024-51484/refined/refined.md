- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Inadequate Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) token validation when activating or deactivating controllers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient CSRF token validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can change website features that should only be managed by administrators. They could enable or disable critical features, potentially disrupting services, compromising security, and undermining the integrity of the platform.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation through CSRF attacks using malicious requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to induce a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious page or click a malicious link to trigger the CSRF request.
