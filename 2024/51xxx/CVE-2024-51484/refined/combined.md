GHSA-h6vj-6rvc-3x29
Nov 11, 2024

## Package

Ampache

## Affected versions

7.0.0

## Patched versions

## Description

Blog Article: <https://medium.com/p/02d2dc83b2f6>

Summary

Inadequate Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) token validation has been identified.

Details

The current implementation fails to properly validate CSRF tokens when activating or deactivating controllers. This vulnerability allows an attacker to exploit CSRF attacks, potentially enabling them to change website features that should only be managed by administrators through malicious requests.

Proof of Concept
