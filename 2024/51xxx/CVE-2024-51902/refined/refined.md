- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The TinyCode WordPress plugin (versions <= 1.2.1) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, allowing injection of malicious scripts into the website.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Malicious actors can inject scripts like redirects, advertisements, or other HTML payloads. These injected scripts will be executed when users visit the compromised site. This could lead to various impacts, such as user redirection, unwanted content display, or more severe attacks like session hijacking.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by injecting malicious scripts into the vulnerable component of the TinyCode plugin. The specific injection point isn't mentioned in the provided information.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would require the ability to inject malicious script through the plugin's vulnerable input mechanism, which in this case requires contributor level access to wordpress.
