Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Webriti Custom Login plugin for WordPress (versions <= 0.3) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the lack of CSRF protection within the plugin. This allows an attacker to craft malicious requests that, when unknowingly executed by an authenticated user, can lead to unintended actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users (e.g., administrators) to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
*   The specific impact is case-by-case and depends on the functionality exposed by the plugin without proper CSRF protection.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker leverages CSRF by tricking an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or loading a malicious page containing the forged request.
*   The attack doesn't require any prior authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and find a way to deliver it to a logged-in user of the affected WordPress site (e.g., via social engineering, malicious links, etc.).
*   The attacker does not require any specific access to the website to perform the attack.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is considered a low priority with a CVSS score of 7.1.
*   A virtual patch has been issued by Patchstack to mitigate the issue until an official fix is available.
*   The vulnerability was reported by SOPROBRO on October 11, 2024.
*   There is no official fix available for the vulnerability as of the publication of this information.
