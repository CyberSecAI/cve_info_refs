- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Custom Author URL WordPress plugin versions 2.0.1 and earlier are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions within the WordPress site under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is initiated by a malicious actor who crafts a request that, when triggered by a logged-in user, will perform an action on the user's behalf.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious page. The attacker does not require any specific privileges on the WordPress site.
