Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application uses the `req.headers.host` value to construct the password reset link. This makes it susceptible to Host Header Injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Host Header Injection:** The application directly uses the `Host` header from the HTTP request to construct the password reset link without any sanitization or validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Password reset token leak:** An attacker can manipulate the `Host` header to inject a malicious domain into the password reset link. When a user clicks on this manipulated link, the password reset token is sent to the attacker's controlled domain.
- **Account takeover:** By obtaining the password reset token, the attacker can reset the user's password and gain unauthorized access to the account.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to trigger the forgot password functionality and provide a malicious host header value when requesting the password reset email.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with a modified `Host` header to the vulnerable application. This usually can be done from anywhere on the network that can reach the application, since the Host header can be controlled in a regular HTTP request.
