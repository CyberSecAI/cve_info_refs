{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The WordPress Featured Posts Scroll plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The plugin does not properly validate requests, allowing an attacker to potentially force a logged-in user to perform unintended actions.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into executing it (e.g., via a link or embedded HTML) to perform unintended actions within the vulnerable plugin.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious page containing the crafted CSRF request."
