- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of unencrypted inter-process communication (IPC) between the UltiMaker Cura main application and the CuraEngine slicing process over localhost, using the libArcus protocol on port 49674.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Unencrypted communication of printing settings (plaintext) and G-code instructions (plaintext).
    - Lack of authentication or integrity checks on data exchanged between the processes.
    - Reliance on localhost network communication for sensitive data transmission.
    - Absence of protection against local network packet interception.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Information disclosure of printing settings and G-code instructions.
    - Modification of printing parameters and G-code, potentially leading to:
        - Defective 3D printed objects.
        - Safety hazards due to weakened components.
        - Intellectual property theft in industrial settings.
        - Equipment damage.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - A local attacker with root privileges can intercept and modify the communication between Cura and CuraEngine.
    - Attackers can use network packet manipulation tools (e.g., iptables and NetfilterQueue) to intercept and modify data packets on the localhost network without detection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Local access to the machine running UltiMaker Cura.
    - Root privileges on the local machine.
    - Ability to use network packet manipulation tools.
