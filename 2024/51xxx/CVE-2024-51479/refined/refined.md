Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-51479

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from how Next.js applications were handling authorization in middleware based on the pathname.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Authorization Bypass:** It was possible to bypass authorization checks if they were implemented in middleware based on pathname. This means that unauthorized users could potentially gain access to protected resources by manipulating the request in a way not properly handled by the middleware.
- **Inadequate Pathname Handling:** The underlying cause is related to how Next.js processes or interprets pathnames, leading to potential bypass scenarios.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could bypass intended authorization mechanisms, gaining access to protected resources or functionalities without proper authentication.
- **Confidentiality Violation:** Exploiting this vulnerability could result in the exposure of sensitive data. Though the CVSS metrics rate confidentiality impact as high, integrity and availability are none.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- **Pathname manipulation:** The attack likely involves crafting specific requests with manipulated pathnames, which the vulnerable middleware fails to process correctly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No privileges are required.** The attacker does not need any pre-existing access to the system.
- **No user interaction is required.** The attacker does not need to trick a user into performing any actions to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Next.js versions `9.5.5` up to and including `14.2.14`.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version `14.2.15`
- Vercel deployments are automatically mitigated, regardless of the Next.js version used.
- The vulnerability was reported by tyage (GMO CyberSecurity by IERAE).
- The CVSS score is 7.5, with a high confidentiality impact
