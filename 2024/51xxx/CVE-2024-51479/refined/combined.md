# Authorization bypass in Next.js

High

[jackwilson323](/jackwilson323)
published
GHSA-7gfc-8cq8-jh5f
Dec 17, 2024

## Package

npm

next
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>=9.5.5 <=14.2.14

## Patched versions

14.2.15

## Description

### Impact

If a Next.js application is performing authorization in middleware based on pathname, it was possible for this authorization to be bypassed.

### Patches

This issue was patched in Next.js `14.2.15` and later.

If your Next.js application is hosted on Vercel, this vulnerability has been automatically mitigated, regardless of Next.js version.

### Workarounds

There are no official workarounds for this vulnerability.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-51479
