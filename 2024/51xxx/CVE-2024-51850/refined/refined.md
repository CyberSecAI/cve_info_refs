Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The WordPress WoW Guild Armory Roster Plugin (versions <= 0.5.5) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This means the plugin does not properly sanitize user inputs or data, allowing malicious code injection.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization, which allows for the injection of malicious scripts. This is a classic case of XSS vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the website. These scripts can then be executed in the browsers of website visitors. The attacker can potentially redirect users to malicious sites, display unwanted advertisements, or perform other harmful actions by manipulating HTML content on the compromised website.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin's handling of user-provided data which lacks proper sanitization before rendering it in the web page.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the vulnerable parts of the plugin, which can be accomplished with contributor level access.
