Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-51743

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of user-provided file paths in multiple controllers, specifically within the `AutomatedTestsController` and `StarterFileGroupsController`. This allows for arbitrary file writes on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The application fails to properly sanitize and validate file paths provided by users, allowing attackers to specify paths outside of intended directories.
- **Arbitrary File Write:** By manipulating file paths, authenticated instructors can write arbitrary content to any location on the server where the application has write permissions.
- **Insecure use of `constantize`:** Although a whitelist was in place, usage of `constantize` in the `NotesController` could potentially lead to issues, and it was removed as a preventative measure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can leverage the arbitrary file write vulnerability to achieve remote code execution. This can be done by writing a Ruby file to the `config/initializers/` directory, which is loaded upon application startup.
- **Full Server Compromise:** Successful RCE can lead to full control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerabilities are present in the web interface through the various controllers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated instructor to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by GitHub Security Lab (GHSL) with three separate reports: GHSL-2024-062, GHSL-2024-063, and GHSL-2024-064.
- The vulnerability was addressed in MarkUs v2.4.8 through sanitization of user-provided paths via a new `FileHelper.checked_join` method.
- The fix included the removal of the use of `constantize` in the `NotesController` and the introduction of checks for user-provided paths to prevent traversal outside of the expected folder.
