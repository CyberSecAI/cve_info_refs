* **Attack Vectors:** The attack would involve tricking a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a compromised page that crafts a request to the vulnerable plugin.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to lure a logged-in user into performing an action that triggers the CSRF vulnerability. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated.
