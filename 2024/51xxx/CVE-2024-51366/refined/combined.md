**OmegaT** is a translation memory application that works on Windows, macOS, Linux…
It is a tool intended for professional translators. It does not
translate for you! (Software that does this is called "machine
translation". OmegaT can interface to some machine translation programs or Internet services)

OmegaT is free software. That means that users like you can download and use it with no restrictions.
You are also free to copy it and pass it on to other people and even modify OmegaT to suit your own requirements.
A more detailed [explanation of free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) can be found on the Free Software Foundation website.

### Professional features

* Fuzzy matching
* Match propagation
* Simultaneous processing of multiple-file projects
* Simultaneous use of multiple translation memories
* User glossaries with recognition of inflected forms

### Work with more than 30 file formats

* Microsoft Office Word, Excel, PowerPoint (2007 or later)
* XHTML and HTML
* OpenDocument Format (native file format for LibreOffice, Apache OpenOffice)
* MediaWiki (Wikipedia)
* Plain text
* …and around 30 other file formats

### Powerful tools

* Unicode support: can be used with various alphabets and scripts
* Support for right-to-left languages
* Integral spelling checker that uses Hunspell dictionaries (same as in other software such as LibreOffice or Mozilla FireFox)
* Compatible with other translation memory applications via exchange formats such as TMX, TTX, TXML, XLIFF, SDLXLIFF
* Interface to machine translation/neural machine translation software/Web services

## The OmegaT project and you

OmegaT isn't just a product; it's an exciting project, and you can be
part of it.

The OmegaT project would benefit from greater support from volunteers
in almost all areas. Although many users are aware of this, their
reaction is often "But I can't program!". Programming is certainly the
most important function, and without programming, there is no program.
But programming isn't the only job needing to be done. Below is a list of
areas for which further volunteers would be more than welcome!

### Documentation authoring

[Documentation](documentation) is very important. Many of you reading this will be
translators who have translated a lot of user documentation. Have you
considered writing some user documentation yourself? It's a real
eye-opener!

### Localization

Thanks to the work of translators in the past, OmegaT's user
interface and/or Help texts have been translated into several
languages. That means there are only a few thousand left! Localizing
OmegaT into other languages is also an ongoing task, since new
features and functions are being added all the time.
Please contact the OmegaT Localization Co-ordinator for
details of what is involved in localizing/translating OmegaT.

### Testing

One of the most useful things OmegaT users can do is... to use
OmegaT. And when they find things that don't work, or deficiencies in
the documentation, to tell us about them.

Also, consider testing [weekly builds](https://sourceforge.net/projects/omegat/files/Weekly/)
of OmegaT that may contain even more new and fascinating bugs!

### Publicity

Have you ever written an article for your professional
association's journal? If not, why not write an article on using
OmegaT?

### Donations

If you have found OmegaT useful and would like to express your
gratitude by making a [donation](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/donate/?source=website) on our Paypal account.

### Programming (Java)

OmegaT is written in Java. If you're a programmer, and you happen to know Java,
please check the [OmegaT contribution guide](https://omegat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
or its document source text in the [source code](download#downloadTrunk) under
/docs\_devel for information on how to get started.

### Programming (not Java)

If you can program in another language, you can write code to
support the core application. Such auxiliary code has already been
written in Javascript, Groovy and Tcl/Tk, for instance.

But I can't program at all, I hear you say. Well, have you
considered learning? If you are already reasonably familiar with
computers in general and choose a straightforward scripting language
like Javascript or Tcl/Tk, you could teach yourself enough to be able to write
simple but useful scripts within just a couple of weeks. Continuing
Professional Development is the current buzzword!
