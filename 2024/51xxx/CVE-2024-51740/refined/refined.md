- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The user portal form manager allows instantiation of arbitrary PHP classes, leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unrestricted instantiation of PHP classes allows attackers to control the execution flow and potentially make HTTP requests on behalf of the server.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability enables a low-privileged user to make HTTP requests from the server, potentially leading to information disclosure or further attacks on internal systems.
- **Attack vectors:** Network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Low-privileged user access to the iTop user portal.
