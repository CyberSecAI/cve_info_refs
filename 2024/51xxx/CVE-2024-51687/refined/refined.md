- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Platform.ly Official WordPress plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions within the plugin, under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, will execute the desired actions on the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user to trigger a crafted request. The attacker does not need to have any prior authentication on the affected website.
