Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The Clever Addons for Elementor plugin, in versions up to and including 2.2.1, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This indicates a lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding within the plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin does not adequately sanitize user-controlled input before rendering it on the page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Malicious Script Injection:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript into the website.
*   **Website Manipulation:** The injected scripts can be used to perform various malicious actions, including redirects, displaying unwanted advertisements, and potentially stealing sensitive user information.
*   **Compromised User Experience:**  The injected scripts can disrupt the normal functionality of the website and compromise the user experience.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Injection via Input Fields:** The attacker injects malicious scripts through input fields, which are later displayed on the website without proper sanitization.
*   **Contributed Content:**  A user with 'Contributor' privileges could inject the XSS payload. This suggests that the vulnerability may exist in areas where contributors can add content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Contributor Access:** The attacker needs contributor privileges to exploit the vulnerability, indicating that it could be an authenticated vulnerability.
*   **Ability to inject malicious code:** An attacker needs the ability to inject malicious scripts, potentially via a form or other input field.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability has a low severity, although the CVSS score is 6.5, which is considered medium.
*   No official fix is available for this vulnerability yet.
