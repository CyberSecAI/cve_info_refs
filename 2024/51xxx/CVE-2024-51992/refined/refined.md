{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a method exposure issue in the Orchid Platform's asynchronous modal functionality. It allows attackers to call arbitrary methods within the `Screen` class.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Exposed Dangerous Method or Function (CWE-749). The application exposes internal methods that should not be accessible from the outside.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers could potentially brute force database tables, perform validation checks against user credentials, and disclose the server's real IP address.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network. The vulnerability is exploited through network requests to asynchronous modal endpoints.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires high privileges within the application to exploit the vulnerability."
