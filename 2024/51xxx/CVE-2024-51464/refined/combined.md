# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*

CUSTOMERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF ANY ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY. In addition to other efforts to address potential vulnerabilities, IBM periodically updates the record of components contained in our product offerings. As part of that effort, if IBM identifies previously unidentified packages in a product/service inventory, we address relevant vulnerabilities regardless of CVE date. Inclusion of an older CVEID does not demonstrate that the referenced product has been used by IBM since that date, nor that IBM was aware of a vulnerability as of that date. We are making clients aware of relevant vulnerabilities as we become aware of them. "Affected Products and Versions" referenced in IBM Security Bulletins are intended to be only products and versions that are supported by IBM and have not passed their end-of-support or warranty date. Thus, failure to reference unsupported or extended-support products and versions in this Security Bulletin does not constitute a determination by IBM that they are unaffected by the vulnerability. Reference to one or more unsupported versions in this Security Bulletin shall not create an obligation for IBM to provide fixes for any unsupported or extended-support products or versions.

IBM Navigator for i supports the vast majority of tasks that were available in the System i Navigator Windows client application.
This Web application is part of the base IBM i operating system, and can be easily accessed from your web browser.
[Vulnerability Type]
HTTP Security Token Bypass
[CVE Reference]
CVE-2024-51464
[Security Issue]
IBM i is vulnerable to bypassing Navigator for i interface restrictions. By sending a specially crafted request, an authenticated attacker could exploit this
vulnerability to remotely perform operations that the user is not allowed to perform when using Navigator for i.
The web application generates an HTTP security token ID called "Mn:" with a 19 digit value and is set in the HTTP session response header per user.
Navigator, uses this token for integrity purpose to protect against arbitrary and or malicious HTTP requests. Therefore, upon receipt of a bogus
security token in an HTTP request the server will respond with HTTP 403 Forbidden message.
However, attackers can modify existing tokens to bypass the 403 Forbidden directive to achieve their objectives. Problem is Navigator security token logic
does not properly create or detect if a security token is valid or if it has been tampered with.
Attackers can manipulate the last eight digits of a token by setting them to all 0000s (zeroes) and or increment them by one, token length must be the same.
This can trick the application into processing attacker controlled security tokens as the server thinks it is valid, this undermines the security of this protection.
E.g. Valid HTTP header generated by the server.
Mn: 6844795211344371559
Content-Length: 290
Origin: https://10.1.1.4:2003
Example of a bogus but honored MN header token set by an attacker, padded with zeros and happily accepted by the backend servlet.
Mn: 6844795211300000000
The MN token is generated in the "initProtectionSetting" java method.
public void initProtectionSetting(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {
initEncryption();
initSession();
[ REDACTED ]
setMagicNumber(magicNumber);
response.setHeader("MN", magicNumber + "");
setUserAgent(request.getHeader("User-Agent"));
}
In the (doFilter) Method we see the check for MN header which sends HTTP 403 on invalid tokens.
String mnStr = hRequest.getHeader("MN");
if (mnStr == null)
mnStr = hRequest.getParameter("MN");
if (!isMnMatched(mnStr, hSession)) {
NavLogger.severe("Forbidden. Incorrect HTTP ID");
NavLogger.info("Request URI: " + requestURI);
hResponse.sendError(403);
return;
Invalid token response will return:
Error 403: SRVE38895F: Error reported: 403
Attacker increments MN or pad with zeros and requests are accepted and the token succeeds.
HTTP 200 OK
[References]

https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/7179509
IBM classified as "CWE-644: Improper Neutralization of HTTP Headers for Scripting Syntax".
To be clear HTTP headers are just the delivery method for sending attacker controlled tokens to bypass Navigator protection.

Mn: 6844795211300000000

The MN token is generated in the "initProtectionSetting" java method.

public void initProtectionSetting(HttpServletRequest request,
HttpServletResponse response) {
    initEncryption();
    initSession();

   [ REDACTED ]

    setMagicNumber(magicNumber);
    response.setHeader("MN", magicNumber + "");
    setUserAgent(request.getHeader("User-Agent"));
  }

In the (doFilter) Method we see the check for MN header which sends
HTTP 403 on invalid tokens.

     String mnStr = hRequest.getHeader("MN");
        if (mnStr == null)
          mnStr = hRequest.getParameter("MN");
        if (!isMnMatched(mnStr, hSession)) {
          NavLogger.severe("Forbidden. Incorrect HTTP ID");
          NavLogger.info("Request URI: " + requestURI);
          hResponse.sendError(403);
          return;

Invalid token response will return:
Error 403: SRVE38895F: Error reported: 403

Attacker increments MN or pad with zeros and requests are accepted and
the token succeeds.
HTTP 200 OK

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.
