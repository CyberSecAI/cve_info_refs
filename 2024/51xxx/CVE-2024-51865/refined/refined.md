{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Simple Social Share Block plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the plugin fails to sanitize user-controlled input, allowing injection of malicious scripts.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website. These scripts are executed when guests visit the site, potentially leading to various malicious actions like user redirection, information theft, or defacement.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the plugin's functionality, where user-controlled input is not properly sanitized before being rendered on the webpage.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into the vulnerable plugin's input fields, which might require them to have contributor or higher privileges within the WordPress environment or to exploit other vulnerabilities that can inject code into the plugin's output. They would need to be able to manipulate the input that the vulnerable component handles to achieve the XSS."
