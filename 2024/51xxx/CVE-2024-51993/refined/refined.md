- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Passwords for misconfigured users are stored in clear text in the database.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cleartext storage of sensitive data (passwords).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker who gains access to a database backup or the database itself can read user passwords.
- **Attack vectors**: Accessing a backup file or the database directly.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs access to either a backup of the database or the database itself. The attacker needs high privileges to access the database.
