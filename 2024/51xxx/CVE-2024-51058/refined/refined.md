Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-51058:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the `img src` attribute within HTML content processed by TCPDF. Specifically, the library did not properly restrict access to parent directories, allowing an attacker to traverse directories.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Local File Inclusion (LFI): The primary vulnerability is the ability to include and read arbitrary local files from the server's filesystem.
- Path Traversal: The vulnerability is triggered through the use of `../` within the `img src` attribute, which allows for path traversal.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Sensitive information disclosure: Attackers can read arbitrary files from the server's file system. This can expose sensitive information, including application source code, configuration files, and potentially user data or credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
- By including an `img` tag with a crafted `src` attribute containing `../` sequences within the HTML content processed by TCPDF.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the HTML content that is processed by TCPDF. This could be achieved through user-supplied input in a web application or by exploiting another vulnerability to inject arbitrary HTML.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability in commit `bfa7d2b6d455ebf72ebe3d48fbd487ee5a1f6f3b` adds a check to prevent accessing parent directories using `str_contains($imgsrc, '../')`.
- The vulnerability was present in TCPDF version 6.7.5 and was fixed in version 6.7.6.
