Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The WordPress Pay With Stripe Plugin (versions <= 1.2.1) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This means the plugin doesn't properly sanitize user inputs, allowing malicious actors to inject scripts into the website.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization, leading to XSS vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts (e.g., redirects, advertisements, other HTML payloads). When a user visits the affected page, these scripts are executed within their browser, potentially leading to user compromise, data theft or other malicious activities.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts via unsanitized user inputs.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the plugin through some form of user input. The specific input method isn't described in this content, however the attacker is only required to have "contributor" level access.
