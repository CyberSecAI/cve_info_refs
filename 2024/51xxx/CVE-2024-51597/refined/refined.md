- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ThemeShark Templates & Widgets for Elementor Plugin <= 1.1.7 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin is susceptible to XSS attacks, which allows a malicious actor to inject arbitrary scripts into the website.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful XSS attack could allow a malicious actor to inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into your website, which will be executed when guests visit the site. This could potentially lead to website defacement, user redirection to malicious sites, or the execution of arbitrary code within the user's browser.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin, where user-supplied data is not properly sanitized or encoded, allowing the injection of malicious scripts. The specific injection point is not described.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to inject malicious scripts into the plugin's vulnerable input fields/areas. This is likely through a contributor role.
