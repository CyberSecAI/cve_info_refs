Root cause of vulnerability: The NetAdmin IAM system (version 4.0.30319) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to improper handling of user-supplied input in the `Content` parameter of the `/BalloonSave.ashx` endpoint.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The system fails to properly sanitize or encode the user-provided content, allowing injection of malicious scripts. This lack of input sanitization and output encoding leads to a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.

Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code which will be executed when a user visits the vulnerable page. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or redirection of the user to malicious websites.

Attack vectors: The attacker crafts a malicious script in the `Content` parameter of a request to the `/BalloonSave.ashx` endpoint. The vulnerable parameter can be reached over the network and is reachable by any authenticated user.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the NetAdmin IAM system.
