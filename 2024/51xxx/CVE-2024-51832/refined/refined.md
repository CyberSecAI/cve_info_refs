- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Plenigo WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin has an XSS vulnerability, allowing the injection of malicious scripts into the website.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads, which will be executed when users visit the site, potentially leading to compromise or other malicious activity.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a user visits the site with the malicious script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to inject the malicious script, likely through a user-controlled input. The attacker needs no other privileges. A contributor level privilege on the plugin might be required.
