Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The WordPress Custom URL Shortener Plugin (versions <= 0.3.6) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The plugin is susceptible to XSS, specifically an injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:** A malicious actor can inject arbitrary scripts, including redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website. When users visit the affected pages, these scripts would be executed in their browsers, potentially leading to:
    *  Redirection to malicious websites.
    *  Display of unwanted advertisements.
    *  Other forms of malicious activity.

**Attack Vectors:**  The vulnerability is exploited via injecting malicious scripts into the vulnerable areas of the plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker would need to be able to inject malicious script, which would require some level of access or input to the website, at least the ability to provide data to the plugin. The specific method of injection is not provided in this content. A 'contributor' role is mentioned, which may imply the vulnerability requires at least that privilege level.
