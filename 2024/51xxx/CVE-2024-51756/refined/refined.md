{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The cap-std library on Windows did not properly sanitize file paths, failing to block access to special device filenames using superscript digits (e.g., COM¹, LPT⁰).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input sanitization",
      "Improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a sandbox"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could bypass the intended filesystem sandbox by using special device filenames with superscript digits, gaining access to peripheral devices (modems, printers, etc.) connected to serial or parallel ports, or network resources mapped to these devices.",
    "attack_vectors": "By providing crafted filesystem paths with special device filenames using superscript digits.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control or influence the filesystem path used by the vulnerable application running on Windows. Low privileges are sufficient for exploitation."
