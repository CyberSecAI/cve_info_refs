## Package

Ampache

## Affected versions

7.0.0

## Patched versions

7.0.1

## Description

Blog Article: <https://medium.com/p/1331e282c83c>

## Summary

Potential for "User" to Takeover Administrator Account

## Details

This document outlines a critical vulnerability that allows a user to take control of an Administrator account. It includes a description of the vulnerability, exploitation scenarios, and recommended fixes.

### Simple Fix

##### Vulnerability Overview

The vulnerability exists in the interface section of the Ampache menu, where users can change "Custom URL - Logo". This section is not properly sanitized, allowing for the input of strings that can execute JavaScript.

##### Normal Usage

When a user changes the logo URL, the expected output should be:

```
<img src="**https://website.com/logo.png**">
```

Character `**` represent what is input in the logo field

##### Attack Scenario

As an attacker, I can insert the following code:

```
<img src="**https://website.com/logo.png" onload="JAVASCRIPT_HERE**">
```

Character `**` represent what is input in the logo field

##### Recommended Fix

To address this vulnerability, implement stronger input sanitization measures to prevent the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code. This includes validating the input to ensure that only safe and expected values are allowed.

### Exploitation Scenario

1. CSRF Login: The attacker creates a malicious link that, when clicked, triggers a CSRF request, logging the admin into the attacker’s account (User) on the Ampache Service. We've also set up the XSS vulnerability to execute the following script automatically once admin login on the User account: [VIEW HERE](https://xss.expert/script.js).
2. XSS Payload Injection: XSS payload executes, capturing the attacker’s cookies, saving them to local storage, clearing all cookies (logging out the admin), and setting the attacker’s cookie with a specific path of /index.php. When the admin logs back in and visits /index.php, the application will use the attacker's cookies for the session.
3. Redirection to Login: The admin is redirected to /login.php to re-authenticate.
4. Accessing /index.php: After logging in, the admin accesses /index.php, where the XSS get executed again, leading to the exfiltration of the admin's cookies.

## PoC

I created a video proof of concept (PoC) to illustrate this vulnerability in a clearer way. You can watch it here: [Video PoC](https://youtu.be/UN5jmr90LlI).

## Impact

This vulnerability allows for account takeover, enabling the execution of JavaScript on any pages. This could lead to unauthorized access, data theft, and potentially compromise the entire system.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
