{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists in the interface section of the Ampache menu, specifically in the \"Custom URL - Logo\" setting. This field does not properly sanitize user input, allowing for the injection of malicious strings that can execute JavaScript.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "Insufficient input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "This vulnerability enables an attacker to perform account takeover by executing arbitrary JavaScript code on any pages. This can lead to unauthorized access, data theft, and potentially compromise the entire system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into the \"Custom URL - Logo\" field.",
        "CSRF is used to log in the admin into the attacker's account to trigger the XSS."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs a low-privileged user account on the Ampache platform. The attacker also requires that an administrator user views a page where the stored XSS is rendered."
