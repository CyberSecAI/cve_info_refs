Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- Firepad, a collaborative text editor, stores the full revision history of documents in its database. This includes all text that has ever been pasted into the editor, even if it has been subsequently deleted by the user.
- The application does not implement proper deletion of data from its server, instead only making it disappear for the end users.
- Firepad lacks any authentication mechanism, meaning anyone can access a pad's content if they know the identifier.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of sensitive information. Deleted content is not actually deleted from the server and can be retrieved.
- **Lack of Access Control:** Anyone with the pad identifier can access the content, including the full history of edits.
- **Insecure Data Handling:** The application does not properly remove user data from its backend servers when requested by the user.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive information (passwords, keys, personal data etc.) that users may have pasted into the editor, with the misconception that deleted data is removed.
- **Privacy Violation:** Users' privacy is compromised because their past actions and data are not removed.
- **Unintended Data Exposure:**  Potentially private information becomes available to unauthorized parties.

**Attack vectors:**

- An attacker needs to know the identifier of a Firepad instance.
- The attacker can then use WebSocket requests to the backend server to retrieve not just the current content, but the full history of all edits.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs the identifier of a Firepad document/pad. No authentication or special access is required
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept and send HTTP and WebSocket requests.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided article highlights how data is not deleted from the backend server.
- The article references endpoints and credentials that were found during the investigation, suggesting potentially broader impact.
- The github page confirms that Firepad is an open source project.
- The firebase blog provides background on Firepad, highlighting that it stores the full revision history, which is the root of the vulnerability.
