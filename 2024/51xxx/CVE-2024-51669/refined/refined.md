- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Dynamic Widgets plugin, in versions 1.6.4 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to potentially execute unwanted actions on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could force higher privileged users to perform actions they did not intend to, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is achieved by tricking an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious page containing a crafted request that will execute actions on the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into executing a forged request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated themselves, but the user needs to be logged in and have the necessary permissions.
