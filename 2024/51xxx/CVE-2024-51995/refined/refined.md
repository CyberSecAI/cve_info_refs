- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A logic bug in `ajax.render.php` allows an attacker to bypass the 'backOffice' access control. The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `ajax.render.php` page does not properly restrict the `route` parameter, allowing an attacker to request any route as long as a valid `operation` is specified.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Improper access control
    - Lack of input validation for the `route` parameter in `ajax.render.php`
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can bypass access controls and potentially gain unauthorized access to functionalities or data within the application. This could lead to information disclosure (High Confidentiality), data modification (Low Integrity) and potentially other attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack. Attacker sends malicious request to the vulnerable `ajax.render.php` page by crafting the `route` and `operation` parameters to bypass access control.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs network access to the iTop application and must be able to send HTTP requests. Low privileges are required. No user interaction is required.
