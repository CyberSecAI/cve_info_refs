  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads, into the website. These scripts will then be executed when guests visit the site.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited through the injection of malicious scripts into the website, likely through user-supplied input that is not properly sanitized or encoded.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the vulnerable application, typically through a user-supplied field. This could be achieved via a compromised account or a vulnerability that allows for unauthenticated injection."
