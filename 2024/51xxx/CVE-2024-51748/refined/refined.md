      "CWE-27"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": "By uploading a modified sqlite.db with a crafted `application_language` setting that points to a malicious PHP file (translations.php) placed on the server, an attacker can trigger the execution of arbitrary code.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An authenticated Kanboard admin must be able to upload a modified sqlite database file and place a file (named translations.php) with the PHP payload on the server through other means like an anonymous FTP server."
