**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an XXE (XML External Entity) vulnerability present in multiple modules of the `org.hl7.fhir.core` repository.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is an XXE (XML External Entity) Injection. This weakness allows an attacker to inject malicious XML entities that can be processed by the application, leading to several potential attacks.
