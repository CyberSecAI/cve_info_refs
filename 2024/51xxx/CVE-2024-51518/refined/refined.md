**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-51518

**Vulnerability Description:** Vulnerability of message types not being verified in the advanced messaging module.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of verification of message types within the advanced messaging module. This indicates that the system doesn't properly validate the type of messages being processed, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The core weakness is the absence of proper input validation, specifically for message types. This allows a malicious actor to potentially send messages of an unexpected or crafted type.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect service availability. The lack of message type validation could lead to crashes, hangs, or other service disruptions, rendering the messaging feature unusable or unreliable.

**Attack vectors:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted messages with invalid or unexpected types to the advanced messaging module.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to send messages to the affected messaging module. This might require network access or the ability to interact with the messaging service through an existing communication channel.

**Affected Versions:** HarmonyOS 5.0.0
