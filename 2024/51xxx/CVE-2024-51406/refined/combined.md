Copy link

### **[Saber-Berserker](/Saber-Berserker)** commented [Oct 23, 2024](#issue-2608310212)

| **Describe the bug** After the controller successfully establishes the logical topology of a physical device, a host can send forged packets in a selected independent cluster to establish an external link in that cluster, and then the controller ignores updates from other clusters, leading to a denial-of-service attack.  **To Reproduce** Steps to reproduce the behavior :   1. Start the controller and mininet :     ```    java -jar target/floodlight.jar    sudo mn --switch=ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow13 --topo tree,3 --controller remote    ``` 2. Check network connectivity :    [image-20241021162652078](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/55580524/379240514-c02a8b6f-9f92-49eb-8b76-cf2867995327.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.QTLQXgj4PctN8X0hhBxBsr6FlCpxL-Ahp0PXPGt8jVw) 3.

# Floodlight OpenFlow Controller (OSS)

## Attention!

As of August 2018, the Floodlight mailing list has moved to floodlight@groups.io! Archives and the new group home page [can be found here](https://groups.io/g/floodlight). Please see [Documentation and Support](#Documentation-and-Support) below for up-to-date support information.

## Build Status

[![Build Status](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6ea65ae0f5a94787129d343e19fe8ea97c043728de8b944d2962e31de29c8af2/68747470733a2f2f7472617669732d63692e6f72672f666c6f6f646c696768742f666c6f6f646c696768742e7376673f6272616e63683d6d6173746572)](https://travis-ci.org/floodlight/floodlight)

## What is Floodlight?

Floodlight is the leading open source OpenFlow controller. It is [supported by a community of developers](https://floodlight.atlassian.net/wiki/display/floodlightcontroller/Authors%2Band%2BContributors), including a number of engineers from [Big Switch Networks](http://www.bigswitch.com/).

## What is OpenFlow?

OpenFlow is a open standard managed by Open Networking Foundation. It specifies a protocol by which a remote controller can modify the behavior of networking devices through a well-defined “forwarding instruction set”. Floodlight is designed to work with the growing number of switches, routers, virtual switches, and access points that support the OpenFlow standard.

## Getting Started

The quickest way to use Floodlight is to start with our [pre-built VM](https://floodlight.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/floodlightcontroller/pages/8650780/Floodlight%2BVM), which includes the controller, IDE, and everything you need to use Floodlight and/or start developing. You can also deploy and develop with Floodlight [in your own environment](https://floodlight.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/floodlightcontroller/pages/1343544/Installation%2BGuide).

If you are a developer and are looking for project ideas, please take a look at [our current issues](https://github.com/floodlight/floodlight/issues). They are a great way to get started developing with Floodlight and provide a concrete way in which to [give back](#Contribution)!

## Documentation and Support

Ready to get started using Floodlight? The [Floodlight wiki](https://floodlight.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/floodlightcontroller/overview) contains user and developer documentation, as well as helpful tutorials from beginner to advanced.

Do you have a question, comment, or a great idea you'd like to propose to the community? Please subscribe and send to our mailing list floodlight@groups.io. Archives and additional content can be found on the [group homepage](https://groups.io/g/floodlight).

## Contribution

Floodlight is supported by contributions from developers like yourself. If you found and fixed something that needed attention or have added a feature, please consider giving back by [opening a pull request](https://github.com/floodlight/floodlight/pulls). We value each and every contribution, no matter how large or how small.

If you have found a bug or have a feature request, please send a note to floodlight@groups.io and [open a issue](https://github.com/floodlight/floodlight/issues) to track it. If you are able to give back by addressing the issue yourself, please read the above and thank you! If you are unable to contribute a solution, following these simple steps will allow someone the opportunity to do so.

Interested in contributing but don't know where to start? Check out and consider addressing any of [our current issues](https://github.com/floodlight/floodlight/issues).

## Authors and Contributors

Thank you to [all who have contributed](https://floodlight.atlassian.net/wiki/display/floodlightcontroller/Authors%2Band%2BContributors) to Floodlight! Please reach out if we have missed you, so that you can be added to this growing list.
