Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-51208

**Vulnerability:** Unrestricted File Upload

**Root Cause:** The Boat Booking System version 1.0 lacks proper input validation and sanitization for uploaded files, specifically within the image upload mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application allows users (specifically admins) to upload files without proper checks on file type or content. This allows the upload of arbitrary files such as PHP scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious PHP script, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable application. This can lead to complete server compromise, data breaches, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The attack is performed via the web interface, specifically the admin panel for image uploads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Admin Access:** The attacker needs to have administrative credentials to access the vulnerable file upload functionality within the application.
*   **Malicious File Creation:** The attacker must be able to create a malicious file, in this case, a PHP script (`shell.php`) containing code for command execution.

**Detailed Explanation:**

1.  The attacker creates a PHP file (e.g., `shell.php`) containing a system command execution function, like `<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>`.
2.  The attacker logs into the Boat Booking System as an admin.
3.  The attacker navigates to the image upload section of the admin panel (e.g., `https://localhost/bbs/admin/change-image?id=1`).
4.  The attacker uploads the `shell.php` file via the image upload form.
5.  The application saves the file in the `images` directory.
6.  The attacker can now access the uploaded file via a URL like `https://localhost/bbs/images/shell.php?cmd=uname -a`. This executes the `uname -a` command on the server, and the output is displayed. This confirms the vulnerability and allows for the execution of other, more harmful commands.

This detailed breakdown provides a clear picture of how the unrestricted file upload vulnerability can be exploited, leading to RCE.
