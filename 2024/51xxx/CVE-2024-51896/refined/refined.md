Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Magic Slider plugin (versions <= 1.3) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin does not properly sanitize user inputs or data, allowing malicious scripts to be injected.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Malicious scripts can be injected into the website.
- These scripts can be executed when guests visit the site, leading to redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payload execution.
- This could lead to unauthorized actions on behalf of the user, defacement, or malware injection.

**Attack vectors:**
- The specific attack vector is not detailed, however, XSS vulnerabilities are commonly exploited through crafted inputs/parameters sent to the vulnerable web application.
- It is likely related to user-controllable content that is not properly escaped when rendered in the web page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code through the plugin's functionality.
- The attacker must have "Contributor" level privileges which appears to be the minimum role to exploit this.
