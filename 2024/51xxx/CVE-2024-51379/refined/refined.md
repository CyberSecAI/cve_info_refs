The provided content is related to CVE-2024-51379.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the description component of the study section in JATOS v3.9.3. The description field is intended to support Markdown, but it fails to prevent the execution of embedded JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application does not properly sanitize user input in the study description field, allowing attackers to inject and store malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized actions: Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.
- Account takeover: By leveraging the XSS vulnerability and another vulnerability (CSRF), an attacker can create a new admin account and gain elevated privileges, thus compromising confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application.
- Data manipulation and exfiltration: Attackers could potentially steal sensitive data, modify existing information, or launch further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the study description field, where an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code. The code is stored and executed when an administrator views the affected study description.
- Combined with CVE-2024-51381 (CSRF), an attacker can create a new admin account via a crafted payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the JATOS platform.
- The attacker needs to be able to create and modify studies.
- The attacker needs to lure an administrator to view the malicious study description.
