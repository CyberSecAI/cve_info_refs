### Vulnerability Details

**CVE-2024-51503**:  **Security Agent Manual Scan Command Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability**

*ZDI-CAN-25215*

*CVSSv3: 8.0: AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H*

*Weakness: CWE-78: OS Command Injection*

A security agent manual scan command injection vulnerability in the Trend Micro Deep Security 20 Agent could allow an attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code on an affected machine.  In certain circumstances, attackers that have legitimate access to the domain may be able to remotely inject commands to other machines in the same domain.

*Please note: an attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability locally and must have domain user privileges to affect other machines.*

### Mitigating Factors

Exploiting these type of vulnerabilities generally require that an attacker has access (physical or remote) to a vulnerable machine. In addition to timely application of patches and updated solutions, customers are also advised to review remote access to critical systems and ensure policies and perimeter security is up-to-date.

However, even though an exploit may require several specific conditions to be met, Trend Micro strongly encourages customers to update to the latest builds as soon as possible.
