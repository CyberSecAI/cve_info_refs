Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-51753:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the logging of refresh tokens to the console when the `debug` flag is enabled. This was occurring during the session refresh process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive refresh tokens through console logging.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- If the debug flag is enabled, and an attacker has access to the console logs, they could potentially gain access to the refresh tokens.
- With the refresh token, an attacker could potentially obtain new access tokens and impersonate legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through access to the console logs where the application is running, which would require some level of access to the environment or tooling being used.
- This isn't a direct attack on the application, but rather exploiting a misconfiguration/debug setting.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the system where the application is running and be able to view the console logs. This may include access to a developer's machine or logging servers, depending on how the application is deployed.
- The `debug` flag within the application must be enabled to trigger the logging.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in versions prior to 0.4.1 of the `@workos-inc/authkit-remix` package.
- The patch was introduced in version 0.4.1, which modifies the logging strategy to prevent refresh tokens from being logged.
- The severity is considered low because the `debug` flag is disabled by default.
- The fix involved removing logging of the refresh token during session refresh, as seen in the provided commit diff.
