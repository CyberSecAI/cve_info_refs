- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Inadequate Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) token validation when activating or deactivating catalogs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient CSRF token validation, allowing attackers to bypass security measures meant to protect against unauthorized actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can alter website functionality by enabling or disabling critical features, potentially disrupting services, compromising security, and undermining the integrity of the platform.
- **Attack vectors:** CSRF attacks through malicious requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into submitting a forged request.
