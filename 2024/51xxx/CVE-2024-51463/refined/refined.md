- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM i is vulnerable to bypassing IBM Navigator for i interface restrictions and a server-side request forgery (SSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Bypassing IBM Navigator for i interface restrictions.
  - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: The provided document doesn't detail the specific impact of these vulnerabilities. It only states that the IBM i is vulnerable to bypassing interface restrictions and a SSRF.
- **Attack vectors**: The document doesn't explicitly describe the attack vectors. However, based on the vulnerabilities it can be deduced that:
  - An attacker could leverage the bypass of interface restrictions to gain unauthorized access or perform unauthorized actions via the IBM Navigator for i interface.
  - An attacker could use the SSRF vulnerability to make requests from the IBM i server to internal or external resources, potentially leading to information disclosure or further exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The document does not provide details about the required capabilities or position of an attacker.

The document states that the issues can be fixed by applying PTFs to the IBM i.
Affected versions include IBM i 7.5, 7.4, and 7.3.
The document also lists the PTF numbers for each affected version of IBM i.
