{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize file contents when generating reports, leading to stored XSS.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
    "Improper Input Sanitization"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious payload within the spider content, which is then included in the report generation.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to influence the content retrieved by the spider module, which is part of the workflow. The attacker does not need to be authenticated."
