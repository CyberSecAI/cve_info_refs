{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application uses the `file_get_contents` function to retrieve files based on user-provided URLs without proper sanitization or validation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted file upload due to lack of URL filtering/validation",
      "Use of `file_get_contents` with user-supplied URLs"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can remotely download arbitrary files, potentially including malicious PHP scripts, which can then be executed, leading to remote code execution (RCE).",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "By sending a request to `/files?download_file=<URL>`, where the URL points to a malicious file. The application downloads the file, which could contain arbitrary code, and may expose it to other parts of the system or the attacker."
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server and provide a URL parameter.",
        "additional_info": "The vulnerability is located within the LaravelCmsFileAdminController.php and LaravelCmsFileAdminRepository.php files, specifically in the file download functionality. The code uses `file_get_contents` without any filtering, allowing remote file retrieval. The example given shows how a php shell can be downloaded."
