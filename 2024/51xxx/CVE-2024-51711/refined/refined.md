- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Saragna plugin for WordPress, version 1.0 and below, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied inputs, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts. This is a classic XSS vulnerability categorized under OWASP Top 10 as A3: Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the website, which could lead to various outcomes when a user visits the site, including but not limited to redirects, serving of advertisements or execution of other HTML payloads.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is unauthenticated, suggesting an attacker can inject the malicious script without needing any prior privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker does not need to be logged in or have any special access. They can execute the attack by injecting the malicious code that is executed in the context of a user's browser when that user visits the vulnerable page.
