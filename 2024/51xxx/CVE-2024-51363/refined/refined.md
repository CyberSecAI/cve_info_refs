Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Insecure deserialization of untrusted data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   The application deserializes user-provided data without proper sanitization or validation.
*   The application uses Java's XMLDecoder, which is known to be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution via crafted XML payloads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Remote Code Execution (RCE) is possible by crafting a malicious XML payload that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
*   The provided PoC uses `java.lang.ProcessBuilder` to execute the `calc` command, demonstrating the ability to execute arbitrary system commands.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker crafts a malicious XML payload.
*   The attacker saves the malicious XML as a file with the `.hsol` extension.
*   The attacker creates a `.zip` file with the malicious `.hsol` file, and changes the file extension from `.zip` to `.hsol`.
*   The attacker provides the malicious file to the victim.
*   The victim opens the malicious file using "File" -> "Open Puzzle File".

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious XML file.
*   The attacker needs to be able to trick the victim into opening the malicious file with the vulnerable application.
*   No special network position is required.

**Technical Details:**

The provided XML snippet demonstrates how a `java.lang.ProcessBuilder` object can be instantiated and used to execute a system command:

```xml
<java>
    <object class="java.lang.ProcessBuilder">
        <array class="java.lang.String" length="1" >
            <void index="0">
                <string>calc</string>
            </void>
        </array>
        <void method="start"/>
    </object>
</java>
```

This XML payload exploits the insecure deserialization vulnerability in Hodoku by creating a process builder that executes the `calc` command. The attacker can replace `calc` with any arbitrary command they wish to execute on the victim's machine.

The PoC steps also highlight that the vulnerable application expects `.hsol` files and that an attacker can use a renamed `.zip` file containing a crafted `.hsol` file to exploit the vulnerability.
