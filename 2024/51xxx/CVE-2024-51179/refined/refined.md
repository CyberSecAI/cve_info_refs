Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A memory deallocation issue within the Open5GS software, specifically affecting the User Plane Function (UPF) and Session Management Function (SMF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a flood of crafted PFCP (Packet Forwarding Control Protocol) packets to the UPF.
- The vulnerability exists within the processing of these PFCP packets, leading to memory management errors when processing the crafted packets.
- The PFCP message length is manipulated such that when processing the F-SEID IE, the UPF crashes, leading to Denial of Service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service, as the UPF becomes erroneous and crashes after receiving malicious PFCP packets.
- **Disruption of PDU Session Establishment:** The crashes within the UPF prevent the establishment of new Packet Data Unit (PDU) sessions.
- **Impact on SMF:** The Session Management Function (SMF) is also impacted, leading to broader disruptions in core 5G network functionalities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack is conducted remotely via network communication.
- **PFCP Protocol:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting and sending malicious PFCP packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs access to the user plane network to intercept or determine the UPF IP address, PFCP port, and Session Endpoint Identifier (SEID).
- **Knowledge of PFCP:** The attacker needs an understanding of the PFCP protocol to craft malicious packets.
- **Packet crafting capability:** The attacker uses a tool like Scapy to create the malicious packets.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit involves flooding the UPF with a specific type of crafted PFCP message.
- The provided Python script demonstrates how to generate and send these malicious packets.
- The issue was reported on Open5GS GitHub page ([open5gs/open5gs#3497](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/issues/3497))
- A patch has been applied to address this issue ([https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/commit/e3790b45b4bc0b261e0946cf93755099a9525cfd](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/commit/e3790b45b4bc0b261e0946cf93755099a9525cfd))
