- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Sticky Social Bar Plugin <= 2.0 is vulnerable to Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies on a case-by-case basis.
- **Attack vectors**:  The vulnerability is exploited through CSRF attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious site, causing them to unknowingly submit a forged request to the vulnerable plugin. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
