- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This allows injection of malicious scripts into the website.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts (like redirects, advertisements, or other HTML) that would be executed when users visit the site. This could lead to various issues, such as defacement of the website, stealing user credentials or redirecting users to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when a malicious script is injected and executed in a user's browser when they visit the affected website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  An attacker needs to find a way to inject malicious scripts into the website's code or data that is later displayed to users. A contributor-level privilege is required.
