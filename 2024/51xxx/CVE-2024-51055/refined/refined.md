Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input during the installation of Hoosk. Specifically, the `SiteUrl` configuration field is vulnerable to code injection. The application is writing this unsanitized input to a configuration file which is then executed by the php interpreter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Code Injection:** The application fails to properly validate or sanitize the `SiteUrl` input field during the installation process. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP code.
- **Unsafe Configuration File Generation:** The injected code is then written to the configuration file (`config.php`), which is subsequently executed by the PHP interpreter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting PHP code into the `SiteUrl` field, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to a wide range of impacts, including:
    - **Complete System Compromise:** Attackers can gain full control of the server by executing system-level commands.
    - **Data Breach:** They can access sensitive data stored on the server.
    - **Malware Installation:** They can install malware, including backdoors, on the server.
    - **Denial of Service:** Attackers may disrupt the normal operation of the application or server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Installation Process:** The attack vector is the Hoosk installation process itself.
- **Vulnerable Input Field:** The specific vulnerability lies in the handling of the `SiteUrl` input field during the install process.
- **Configuration File:** The vulnerability is then exposed by the generation of `config.php` with the injected payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Initial Access:** The attacker must have the ability to install Hoosk.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability in the `SiteUrl` input field.
- **Ability to Input Malicious Code:** The attacker needs to be able to provide malicious PHP code during the installation process.
- **Access to the generated `config.php`**: The attacker needs to be able to visit `/config.php` after the install to trigger the execution.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided GitHub issue specifically mentions injecting `')phpinfo();//` into the `SiteUrl` field and visiting `/config.php` to get the phpinfo output. This confirms the arbitrary code execution vulnerability.
- The issue report includes screenshots of the phpinfo output to confirm exploitation.
