- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Minical Hotel Booking Plugin, in versions up to and including 1.0.2, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing malicious actors to inject arbitrary scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful XSS attack can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the website. These scripts could lead to redirects, display unwanted advertisements, or perform other actions by injecting arbitrary HTML payloads.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts via a vulnerable input field or parameter within the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A contributor-level user is required to exploit the vulnerability.
