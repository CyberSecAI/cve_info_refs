- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Hola Free Video Player plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack could allow a malicious actor to inject scripts, potentially redirecting users, displaying unwanted advertisements, or executing other HTML payloads within the website.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves injecting malicious scripts through user input.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires the capability to inject malicious scripts, which can be achieved through the plugin's vulnerable points.  The content suggests that a user with "Contributor" level privileges is required, but it is unclear which specific plugin function or user input vector can be exploited.
