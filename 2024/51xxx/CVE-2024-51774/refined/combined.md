From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The following is a general comparison of [BitTorrent clients](/wiki/Glossary_of_BitTorrent_terms#Client "Glossary of BitTorrent terms"), which are [computer programs](/wiki/Computer_program "Computer program") designed for [peer-to-peer file sharing](/wiki/Peer-to-peer_file_sharing "Peer-to-peer file sharing") using the [BitTorrent protocol](/wiki/BitTorrent "BitTorrent").[[1]](#cite_note-btclient-1)

The BitTorrent protocol coordinates segmented file transfer among [peers](/wiki/Glossary_of_BitTorrent_terms#Peer "Glossary of BitTorrent terms") connected in a [swarm](/wiki/Glossary_of_BitTorrent_terms#Swarm "Glossary of BitTorrent terms"). A BitTorrent client enables a user to exchange data as a peer in one or more swarms. Because BitTorrent is a [peer-to-peer](/wiki/Peer-to-peer "Peer-to-peer") [communications protocol](/wiki/Communications_protocol "Communications protocol") that does not need a [server](/wiki/Server_%28computing%29 "Server (computing)"), the BitTorrent definition of *client* differs from [the conventional meaning](/wiki/Client_%28computing%29 "Client (computing)") expressed in the [client–server model](/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model "Client–server model").[[1]](#cite_note-btclient-1)

[Bram Cohen](/wiki/Bram_Cohen "Bram Cohen"), author of the BitTorrent protocol, made the first BitTorrent client, which he also called [BitTorrent](/wiki/BitTorrent_%28software%29 "BitTorrent (software)"), and published it in July 2001.[[2]](#cite_note-2)

Many BitTorrent programs are [open-source software](/wiki/Open-source_software "Open-source software"); others are [freeware](/wiki/Freeware "Freeware"), [adware](/wiki/Adware "Adware") or [shareware](/wiki/Shareware "Shareware"). Some [download managers](/wiki/Download_manager "Download manager"), such as [FlashGet](/wiki/FlashGet "FlashGet") and [GetRight](/wiki/GetRight "GetRight"), are BitTorrent-ready. [Opera 12](/wiki/Opera_%28web_browser%29 "Opera (web browser)"), a [web browser](/wiki/Web_browser "Web browser"), can also transfer files via BitTorrent.

In 2013 Thunder Networking Technologies publicly revealed that some of their employees surreptitiously distributed a Trojan horse with certain releases of [Xunlei](/wiki/Xunlei "Xunlei"), the company's BitTorrent-ready download manager.[[3]](#cite_note-3)[[4]](#cite_note-4) Xunlei is included in the comparison tables.

36. **[^](#cite_ref-128)** Only available in Pro and web version.From version 3.0 this feature is called "Streaming mode". The number of pieces to download sequentially is configurable
37. **[^](#cite_ref-OperaRSS_129-0)** Opera has a feed aggregator that displays feeds like emails.
38. **[^](#cite_ref-130)** Windows and Mac OS X only; via [PMS](/wiki/Package_management_system "Package management system") on Linux.

47. **[^](#cite_ref-154)** Automatically configure port forwarding (requires [Router](/wiki/Router_%28computing%29 "Router (computing)") with [UPnP](/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play "Universal Plug and Play") support)
48. **[^](#cite_ref-155)** Many clients claim to support this, but just UPnP calls for opening a TCP port is not effective and disabled by factory default in most new hardware. "UDP NAT Traversal" is the proper working solution, supported by just a few.
49. **[^](#cite_ref-156)** DHT permits use of trackerless torrents (with supporting clients) to resume normal torrents when their tracker is down. However, some trackers that register their users for keeping tabs on fair usage (such as a ratio of bytes downloaded to uploaded) may not reliably measure and update usage for users employing DHT.
50. **[^](#cite_ref-160)** Reduces disk usage, file fragmentation (in case it is not preallocated) and latencies due to larger written blocks and cached data for hash checking finished pieces.
51. **[^](#cite_ref-161)** Recently implemented (unofficial) web seeding feature, see [HTTP-Based Seeding Specification](http://www.bittornado.com/docs/webseed-spec.txt) [Archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20081028011008/http%3A//www.bittornado.com/docs/webseed-spec.txt) 28 October 2008 at the [Wayback Machine](/wiki/Wayback_Machine "Wayback Machine")

# artifact attestations

From releases after the 03/10/2024 you can use the `artifact_attestations` to verify the provenance of the build.

<https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/using-artifact-attestations/using-artifact-attestations-to-establish-provenance-for-builds>

Using `gh` cli you can use this command to verify the provenance of the build:

For example, using the `x86_64-qbittorrent-nox` build:

```
gh attestation verify x86_64-qbittorrent-nox -o userdocs
```

## Summary

The `qbittorrent-nox-static` project is a `bash` build script that compiles a static `qbittorrent-nox` binary using the latest available dependencies from their source. These statically linked binaries can run on any matching CPU architecture and are not OS specific. This means you can run a `x86_64` Alpine edge build on any Linux based OS of like CentOS | Fedora | OpenSuse | Debian | Ubuntu and more.

Tip

You don't need to use the script to access the binaries it creates, just use the [release tag](https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/tags) you need or [latest release page](https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/releases/latest)

See here for how to [install the latest release](https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static?tab=readme-ov-file#install-the-latest-release)

## Linked Github repositories

This build script uses and depends on some related repositories.

* [qbt-musl-cross-make](https://github.com/userdocs/qbt-musl-cross-make)
* [qbt-workflow-files](https://github.com/userdocs/qbt-workflow-files)

## Documentation

Tip

Visit the [documentation](https://userdocs.github.io/qbittorrent-nox-static/introduction/) for in depth information on using this project and script usage.

## WSL2

Tip

These static builds can be used on WSL2 and accessed via `localhost:8080` using the download instructions below

## Install the latest release

Tip

For the most current build visit the [latest release page](https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/releases/latest)

Or uses these commands for your arch:

### x86

```
mkdir -p ~/bin && source ~/.profile
wget -qO ~/bin/qbittorrent-nox https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/releases/latest/download/x86-qbittorrent-nox
chmod 700 ~/bin/qbittorrent-nox
```

### x86\_64

```
mkdir -p ~/bin && source ~/.profile
wget -qO ~/bin/qbittorrent-nox https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/releases/latest/download/x86_64-qbittorrent-nox
chmod 700 ~/bin/qbittorrent-nox
```

### armhf (armv6)

```
mkdir -p ~/bin && source ~/.profile
wget -qO ~/bin/qbittorrent-nox https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/releases/latest/download/armhf-qbittorrent-nox
chmod 700 ~/bin/qbittorrent-nox
```

### armv7

```
mkdir -p ~/bin && source ~/.profile
wget -qO ~/bin/qbittorrent-nox https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/releases/latest/download/armv7-qbittorrent-nox
chmod 700 ~/bin/qbittorrent-nox
```

### aarch64

```
mkdir -p ~/bin && source ~/.profile
wget -qO ~/bin/qbittorrent-nox https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/releases/latest/download/aarch64-qbittorrent-nox
chmod 700 ~/bin/qbittorrent-nox
```

## Libtorrent versions

Important

Libtorrent `v1.2` is currently the main branch supported by qBittorrent since a change with the release of [4.4.5](https://www.qbittorrent.org/news.php)

Libtorrent `v2.0` builds are still released as latest releases as it it does not really matter to this project as it always builds and releases for both `v1.2` and `v2.0`. See the next section for how to get the version you need via the latest release URL.

Tip

You can view the current latest and pre releases and tags here <https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/tags>

## Getting the Version you want via the latest release URL

Since this project builds and releases both v1.2 and v2.0 builds simultaneously we can use the commands below to always get the latest version of the related pre release via the latest release `dependency-version.json` asset.

Using this method it does not matter which version is the latest release or pre release as the commands will provide you the version specific info you need for the twinned latest/pre releases.

For Libtorrent `v1.2`

```
jq -r '. | "release-\(.qbittorrent)_v\(.libtorrent_1_2)"' < <(curl -sL https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/releases/latest/download/dependency-version.json)
```

For Libtorrent `v2.0`

```
jq -r '. | "release-\(.qbittorrent)_v\(.libtorrent_2_0)"' < <(curl -sL https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/releases/latest/download/dependency-version.json)
```

## Revisions

The build has 5 main dependencies tracked that will trigger a rebuild on an update being available.

* qBittorrent
* Libtorrent
* Qt
* Boost
* Openssl

When a new build is triggered for updating `qBittorrent` or `Libtorrent` a new release will be generated as the release tags will be updated.

Since I do not append revision info to tags `Qt` - `Boost` - `Openssl` builds will only update the existing release assets.

To track these revisions you can use this command. All new releases start at a revision of `0` and increment by `1` per revised build.

```
jq -r '.revision' < <(curl -sL "https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/releases/latest/download/dependency-version.json")
```

## Dependency json

From `release-4.4.5` each release contains a `dependency-version.json` file that provide some key version information for that is shared across the latest release and the twinned pre release. This helps to overcome some limitations of the API for consistently and directly accessing this information.

Downloading the file like this:

```
curl -sL https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/releases/latest/download/dependency-version.json
```

Will output a result like this:

```
{
    "openssl": "3.2.0",
    "boost": "1.84.0",
    "libtorrent_1_2": "1.2.19",
    "libtorrent_2_0": "2.0.9",
    "qt5": "5.15.12",
    "qt6": "6.6.1",
    "qbittorrent": "4.6.2",
    "revision": "3"
}
```

As demonstrated above by using the latest release URL we can construct the tag of the twinned pre release and therefore the asset URL with no margin for error.

Important

From the release of qBittorrent v5 configure based builds will be unsupported and we will only be able to use cmake to build qBittorrent v5 onwards. All releases from that point on will drop Qt5 builds as at this point cmake,Qt6 and v5 should be the default and preferred build combination with Qt5 being a legacy dependency.

## gh attestation verify

Binaries built from the release of release `release-5.0.0_v2.0.10` and `release-5.0.0_v1.2.19` revision `1` use [actions/attest-build-provenance](https://github.com/actions/attest-build-provenance)

Verify the integrity and provenance of an artifact using its associated cryptographically signed attestations.

<https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_attestation_verify>

For example:

```
gh attestation verify x86_64-qbittorrent-nox -o userdocs
```

Will give you this result for the `release-5.0.0_v2.0.10` revision `1` binary.

#### > Can you email those photos to me?

Sorry, the entire folder is 5GB, and my email service only allows 25MB attachments.

#### > What about Google Drive?

I’m at 90% of my Google Drive quota. Besides, didn’t you see what
[Senator Wyden had to say](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24191267-wyden_smartphone_push_notification_surveillance_letter_to_doj_-_signed)
about Google? I can’t put my wedding photos there!

Maybe you can just install an SFTP client on your end? I’ll need you to also
generate an Ed25519 key; then just send me your public key on Signal and I’ll get you all set up.

## You can use BitTorrent for file-sharing. (It’s not just for pirates.)

Sometimes, it’s surprisingly frustrating to send large files between PCs over the Internet -
or, even on the same network - without using someone else’s computer
(aka The Cloud) as an intermediary.

The BitTorrent protocol is the gold standard for peer-to-peer file
sharing. You probably have used BitTorrent at some point to download (and hopefully seed)
a torrent. Where did that torrent come from? Someone created it!

It’s actually easy to
create your own torrent, even just to send to one or two other people.
You can use BitTorrent as a self-hosted
means to share files like photos or videos, with decent privacy, and it’s simple enough
to use with moderately tech-savvy friends and family.

The toolchain is [7-Zip](https://7-zip.org/download.html) to archive and encrypt
the files you want to send, then [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/download) to
create the torrent file and post it to a tracker. The people you are sharing with use
the same tools in the opposite order: qBittorrent to download, and 7-Zip to decrypt
and un-archive.

### As of 2023-12-14…

As always, things may change; if this post is old, you need to do research to make
sure that what was true in late 2023 is still true:

* 7-Zip and qBittorrent are the best cross-platform, free programs I know of at the
  time of writing this post. The instructions/screenshots are based on 7-Zip v16.02 and
  qBittorrent v4.4.1.
* [OpenTrackr](http://tracker.opentrackr.org/) is a free public tracker I recommend.
  You can check [ngosang/trackerslist](https://github.com/ngosang/trackerslist) to find
  other options if needed.

**Security disclaimer**: The methodology described in this blog post provides adequate privacy for sharing
personal, low-stakes data over the Internet.
Please don’t use this for backing up your employers’ PII dataset or sharing
your country’s nuclear codes.

## How-to

At a high level, the steps are:

1. Create a password-protected (encrypted) 7z archive containing the file(s) you want to share.
2. Create a .torrent file from that 7z archive.
3. Send the .torrent file to the recipients. (This is a small file, and doesn’t need to be kept private.)
4. Securely send the password to the recipients. (The password **does** need to be kept secret!)
5. Leave your torrent seeding until all recipients have downloaded it.

### (1) Create an encrypted 7z archive

Put all the files you want to share into the same folder.
If you’ve installed 7-Zip, you should be able to right-click on the folder and have an
option to compress as a 7z file. Here’s what this looks like in Linux Mint, for example:

![Right click on PinkWojaks folder, mouse-over the Compress option in the drop-down menu](/assets/img/posts/everyday-7zip-bittorrent/right-click-compress.png)

Choose **7z** as the file format and use a strong password.
You need to write down the password somewhere, because you’ll have to share it with your recipients.
Optionally, you can change the filename (like I’ve done here) if you want to hide the
original folder name.

![Dialog to compress the directory. Filename: burly-duckbill-aviation, Password: "GMsDvFPibiwCRpnTxTgKyRi", check "Encrypt the file list too"](/assets/img/posts/everyday-7zip-bittorrent/compress-dialog.png)

### (2) Create a .torrent file

qBittorrent includes a torrent creator wizard, under Tools -> Torrent Creator.

Choose your 7z file, “Start seeding immediately”, and
add a tracker URL. In this case I’m using `udp://tracker.opentrackr.org:1337/announce`

![qBittorrent user interface, with the 7z file selected as the file path, 'start seeding immediately' checked, private torrent NOT checked, and tracker URLs populated with a tracker announcement URL.](/assets/img/posts/everyday-7zip-bittorrent/create-torrent-dialog.png)

Take note that I did not check the ‘Private Torrent’ option - because we **do** want
to enable the “DHT network” so that recipients can auto-discover your IP address.

The distinction here is that the torrent file itself does not need to be private.
The torrent file doesn’t contain the 7z file (your actual data) - it just contains
a “pointer” to tell other computers where to download the file from.

The 7z file contains the original data, but thanks to the mathematical wonders of
cryptography, the encrypted bits are still useless to someone that doesn’t have your password!

Let’s frame this as a Threat Model at this point. There’s a “bad guy” whose objective
is to try to read the original data. Suppose that he intercepts the .torrent file and
uses it to download the encrypted 7z file.
That’s perfectly OK: because you used a strong password when you created
the 7z file, the unintended recipient still can’t open it, because he doesn’t know
and won’t be able to guess your password.

### (3) Send the .torrent file to the recipients

You can use email or any means to share the .torrent file. Remember, the .torrent file does not need
to be kept secret.

### (4) Securely send the password to the recipients

The level of security here depends on the level of privacy you need. If you want
to be paranoid, you can use a messenger service that supports end-to-end encryption, like WhatsApp or
Telegram or Signal. (But, if you would have emailed the original file(s) anyway,
if they had been small enough to fit in an email attachment, you would also be OK with sharing the
password in an email.)

### (5) Leave your torrent seeding until all recipients have downloaded it

Your recipients should be able to open the torrent and download the 7z file. When they open the 7z
archive, they’ll be prompted to enter the password you shared with them.

![password required dialog window](/assets/img/posts/everyday-7zip-bittorrent/password-required.png)

And then the files are there!

![various pink wojaks in an extracted folder](/assets/img/posts/everyday-7zip-bittorrent/mission-accomplished.jpg)

You have to leave qBittorrent running on your computer to seed so that
everyone can download it from you. You’ll see your recipients
show up as peers while they are downloading.

Finally, if you are sharing the file with many recipients, remember that you can
ask them to leave their torrent program open, and they’ll be able to seed to each other.

### I don’t care about privacy. Can I skip the encryption step?

Yes, if your goal is just to share files, and you don’t really care if someone else gets them
or sees what you’re sharing, then you can skip the password-protection and encryption.
And if you are not encrypting the files, it’s OK to skip 7-Zip altogether and
just create a torrent directly from a folder.

### Can I send files this way to someone who only has a smartphone?

On Android, you can use LibreTorrent and ZArchiver. There are probably analogous apps available for iOS.

### Can I use .zip instead of .7z?

I don’t recommend it because the encryption scheme used on .zip files is not very secure.
It can hypothetically be cracked by a determined attacker, even if they don’t guess your password.

## Description [(last modified by Calum)](/ticket/3201?action=diff&version=2 "2018-10-05 12:49:34.776750+00:00")

With the move to a GTK3 UI we need a way to easily create the Windows package.

I am not sure what the best route is going to be but we need something that can always get the latest versions of GTK3 as we had to use outdated PyGTK versions as no other builds existed.

It would be good to drop the usage of MSVC and go with msys2 but there are hurdles to doing that with regards to Twisted and pywin32 (see [#3181](/ticket/3181 "#3181: feature-request: Replace Pywin32 (reopened)")). These are the steps for another GTK3 project building with msys2:

[​https://www.gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php/Gramps\_for\_Windows\_with\_MSYS2](https://www.gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php/Gramps_for_Windows_with_MSYS2)

Alternatively we continue with MSVC and roll our own GTK3 builds:

[​https://github.com/wingtk/gvsbuild](https://github.com/wingtk/gvsbuild)

We will also need to move from bbfreeze to most likely pyinstaller but that is further down the road: [​Freezing comparison](https://docs.python-guide.org/shipping/freezing/)

Help or suggestions with this would be appreciated as primary development is on Ubuntu.

Not sure if it will make a difference but back when I was first starting to make GTK3 changes to deluge I did some work updating bbfreeze to have better module finding and python 3 support. I got all of the python code to python 3 but the python c api portion I could not fix.(it doesnt need much) The code is on my github under ccfreeze if you want to try it out.

Yeah thanks, I remember I was impressed you got that working. However bbfreeze is a dead project now and doesn't officially support Python 3 or GTK3 so we need to move on, despite it serving us well.

So I have had some success testing out building with gvsbuild scripts and I have created a fork of gvsbuild so the job artifacts can be downloaded from appveyor:

[​https://ci.appveyor.com/project/cas--/gvsbuild](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/cas--/gvsbuild)

Currently there are a few windows specific issues with the deluge code:

* Remove `py2-ipaddress` lines from `setup.py` and `requirements.txt`.
* Comment out the entire last `try..except` in `deluge.common.set_env_variable`.

Extract the gvsbuild tarball and add to path. From console in deluge source dir:

```
set PATH=C:\gvsbuild\release;%PATH%
pip install C:\gvsbuild\release\python\pycairo-1.17.1-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl
pip install C:\gvsbuild\release\python\PyGObject-3.28.3-py3.6-win-amd64.whl
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .

```

To get a nicer theme create a file: `C:\gvsbuild\release\etc\gtk-3.0\settings.ini` with the following:

An update to the above steps:

1. Download latest GTK 3.24 gvsbuild tarball and extract to `C:\gvsbuild`:

> [​https://ci.appveyor.com/project/cas--/gvsbuild/build/artifacts](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/cas--/gvsbuild/build/artifacts)

2. Download and install latest Python 3.6:

> [​https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/)

3. Install python dependencies

```
pip.exe install C:\gvsbuild\release\python\pycairo-1.18.0-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl
pip.exe install C:\gvsbuild\release\python\PyGObject-3.32.0-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl
pip.exe install https://download.lfd.uci.edu/pythonlibs/t4jqbe6o/Twisted-19.2.1-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl
pip.exe install https://download.lfd.uci.edu/pythonlibs/t4jqbe6o/setproctitle-1.1.10-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl

```

4. Install deluge
   ```
   pip.exe install deluge deluge-libtorrent

   ```

5. `deluge-libtorrent` wheel currently needs OpenSSL 1.1.0 installed:

> [​https://slproweb.com/download/Win64OpenSSL\_Light-1\_1\_0k.exe](https://slproweb.com/download/Win64OpenSSL_Light-1_1_0k.exe)

6. Install MC VC Runtime:

> [​https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads)

7. Check that libtorrent definitely imports with:
   ```
   python -c "import libtorrent; print(libtorrent.__version__)"

   ```

8. Run deluge:

```
set PATH=C:\gvsbuild\release\bin;%PATH%
deluge.exe

```
> The `gvsbuild` path can be added to global env vars to save setting each time.

I just restarted remaking my build systems to update for gtk3 testing again and pretty much same setup 64-bit and it works except still the libintl name change.

Also still getting an error with the simulate() workaround in connection manager

```
  File "C:\Python\Python37\lib\site-packages\deluge-2.0b2.dev302-py3.7.egg\deluge\ui\gtk3\connectionmanager.py", line 144, in show

    timeout = min(self.timeout(), 0.01)
TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'float' and 'NoneType'

```

it seems a timeout is not set. seems like it would be better if the twisted code checked to see if timeout is set before calling it.

```
        if timeout is None:
            timeout = 0.01
        timeout = min(self.timeout(), 0.01)

instead of

        timeout = min(self.timeout(), 0.01)
        if timeout is None:
            timeout = 0.01

```

but is there something we are missing?

Create a new upstream ticket: [​https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/newticket](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/newticket)

It is an issue with migrating Twisted to Python 3. Python 2 was happy to compare different types but Python 3 is stricter and raises a `TypeError`.

Your suggested fix needs tweaked:

```
-        timeout = min(self.timeout(), 0.01)
-        if timeout is None:
-            timeout = 0.01
+        timeout = self.timeout()
+        if timeout is None:
+            timeout = 0.01
+        timeout = min(timeout, 0.01)

```

In Deluge probably just catch the error and pass or remove it, if it does nothing anymore. The associated comment is not so helpful:

`# XXX: We need to call a simulate() here, but this could be a bug in twisted`

ok so i have reported up. and yea seems like we need something to change in deluge, though doesn't seem like we have too many options other than just ignore it as in python 3 this error stops the connection manager from opening at least the first few times you hit it.(i find if i open preferences then connection manager it opens first time). However this is almost as annoying as the issue simulate solves.

Apparently I can't figure out how to just follow an issue. Hopefully leaving a comment will do the trick.

Keep up the good work :)

Hey all, thanks for the great work you do (that goes straight over my head!). I'm just commenting to point out that these two links that I've pointed out in this reply are no longer valid, and will throw 404 errors. It seems the LFD website has been restructured, and there's not an easily apparent way to get to these modules. I'm trying to install Twisted and setproctitle via pip, and I'll update you guys if it goes wrong.

I was able to find the latest links to the modules here [​https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) (there is a clickable index at the top of the page)

A few quick enhancements to the directions and some observations:

1. Only the 32-bit VC++ executable needs be installed if you are using a 64-bit system.
2. To add the PATH:
   1. Hold the WIN (flag) KEY and press PAUSE(/BREAK) and click ADVANCED SYSTEM SETTINGS, or, open a RUN box, WIN+R, and type SystemPropertiesAdvanced.exe.
   2. Click ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES.
   3. Under 'SYSTEM VARIABLES' (the second section) click PATH.
   4. EDIT and verify or add (NEW) the following:
      C:\Program Files\Python36\Scripts\
      C:\gvsbuild\release\bin
      C:\Windows\System32\OpenSSH\
   5. If you did not install for 'All Users' these paths may instead need to be in your %userprofile% or %appdata% (not verified).
3. Python 3.7 cannot be utilized with the instructions because deluge-libtorrent is incompatible (it is version 36, and 37 is not in the store).
4. A Desktop or Start Menu / etcetera icon can be created if the PATH variables are set. The icon should point to: "C:\Program Files\Python36\Scripts\deluge.exe" . This relies upon default installation locations and an 'all users' configuration.
   1. Make it pretty with the icon located at: C:\Program Files\Python36\Lib\site-packages\deluge\ui\data\pixmaps
5. The default plug-ins are not listed. They can be installed from: "C:\Program Files\Python36\Lib\Site-Packages\Deluge\plugins". They are currently non-functional (they do not add).
6. The button to associate Magnet links is non-functional.

Keep up the good work!

So excited for Deluge 2, was a bit disappointed in the Windows state of things.
I've been reading the bug as well as some forum posts. The title of this bug "Create Windows package (Py3-GTK3)" seems to infer that Deluge will work successfully on Windows, but that no easy package installer exists.

However, it appears from reading here that even with doing manual install of all the components, that Deluge will not be 100% functional on Windows. Specifically, just from this thread I can see:

* simulate() error in Twisted - due to Python 3 compatibility.
* Plugins don't work

I believe the former doesn't effect functionality (just a cosmetic thing?).
However the lack of plugins seems a huge issue in Windows users being able to upgrade.

Is there a more comprehensive list (if more than the above) on why the plugins won't work.
Or, is there a bug that discusses the status of the plugins for Windows?

I am bringing this up here because it seems to me that deluge not providing a simple installer is a bit different than deluge not being able to be run at full functionality \*at all\* on Windows systems.

I think there are many of us who would go through a manual 100 step process to get Deluge running on Windows if we knew it would be 100% functional.

As deluge is using multiple components and some of those components may simply not work with the chosen version of Python, or certain dependencies may not work properly on Windows at all, it starts to look bleak for actual implementation on Windows.

Could we get some more info regarding the status of the actual functionality and what limitations still need to be overcome for windows functionality exclusive of the fact there isn't a proper installer?

I'm not much of a Python coder, but if I knew a bit more about what integration issues we are looking at I wouldn't mind devoting some time to researching for the greater good here.

The default plugins not working can be fixed by renaming the python version in there filenames from '3.7' to '3.6'.

The issues remaining should be about packaging and the instructions given to use it without an installer should give full functionality I believe(when renaming plugins).

It lacks a native windows theme and the magnet-association button was stated to be unfunctionel, though the association can be made manually and in this ticket Cas desribed how to get a windows 7 alike theme enabled also.

Untill a real installer emerges, I've made a 7z-sfx-installer of Deluge2, but it is simply an installer which will give you same result as if following the manual instructions, i.e it will be a much bigger install in size and also adds entries to the Path system-environment-variable.

To get a native windows theme just create an environment variable:
GTK\_CSD with value of 0

There are some details that don't work, like you don't see an arrow indicating a submenu, but overall it's usable and Windows native.

Thanks for the tip obraca! I did previously read about that and experimented with it when I made my 7z-sfx-installer, but I stupidly just thought I could add the option to the settings.ini file, and I also tested adding it instead from terminal with "cmd /c set GTK\_CSD=0 && deluge.exe", but both ways I couldn't see a difference so ditched it, but I stupidly did it wrong and so it never got applied propperly to deluge.exe. When doing it correctly, either by normal ways or e.g. using env.exe from win32 coreutils, then I see it infact does make a difference lol, so thanks for the tip :)

I wanted to report that when following install-instructions then thinclient-mode doesn't work and you cannot exit deluge without killing deluge.exe or python from task-manager or terminal(when thinclient-mode enabled).

While trying to troubleshoot it, I funny enough found a workaround in simply enabling debug-logging :)

So, if using thinclient mode with the provided install-instructions, then add to end of your deluge shortcut-command: ' -L debug -l %userprofile%\deluge.log'

Sorry, addendum to above, then I found that if you play with window size, and/or maximize/minimize, then when selecting connection-manager it will come through, and/or quiting deluge becomes possible, and sometimes more "playing around" is needed than othertimes. Debug-logging solves this still though.

Is there absolutely any way someone could upload the latest version of Libtorrent, compiled with all the latest components, for Windows x64 to PyPi that is compatible with Python 3.6? The Deluge-Libtorrent currently on PyPi is ancient at this point. I love Deluge, but I'd really like to keep my Libtorrent up to date.

I know what everyone here is going to say "build it yourself". I seriously would, but the only set of instructions I know of talk about how to do it in Windows using Python 2.7, rather than Python 3.6 like the Deluge-Libtorrent that is available through PyPi. If someone wants to write a set of instructions on how I can do this myself (the old "Teach a man to fish... etc...") rather than just upload the file, I'm game. I'll sit here and beat my head against that wall until it gives I just honestly don't know enough on how to modify the instructions for the build using Python 2.7 in order to do it for Python 3.6.

The tricky part is that we have 2 (or more compilers) on windows, MSVC and MinGW/GCC. I've uploaded the linux wheel on test, and probably could work on windows wheel in this weekend.

Ah, I understand. That didn't even cross my mind. I was strictly thinking about the instructions above in comment 9. I forgot about those that are using other compilers. Thank you for explaining that to me. It wasn't my intent to disregard other users or push for anything. I am more than happy to wait until whenever to see the end result.

Issues I noticed while trying to run Deluge 2 on Windows:

1. `start_daemon` mixes `bytes` and `str` when calling `subprocess.Popen`: [​https://dev.deluge-torrent.org/ticket/3313#comment:2](https://dev.deluge-torrent.org/ticket/3313#comment:2)

2. The GdkPixbuf (from gvsbuild) seems to have a problem that causes deluge to exit with an access violation¹ after attempting to loading a few .ico files (some of which are invalid). There are no messages in the debug log, but if running in a console it produces the following output:
   ```
   c:\apps\deluge2\venv\lib\site-packages\deluge\ui\gtk3\common.py:75: Warning: cannot register existing type 'GdkPixbufGdipAnim'
     return Pixbuf.new_from_file_at_size(filename, size, size)
   c:\apps\deluge2\venv\lib\site-packages\deluge\ui\gtk3\common.py:75: Warning: g_once_init_leave: assertion 'result != 0' failed
     return Pixbuf.new_from_file_at_size(filename, size, size)
   c:\apps\deluge2\venv\lib\site-packages\deluge\ui\gtk3\common.py:75: Warning: g_object_new_with_properties: assertion 'G_TYPE_IS_OBJECT (object_type)' failed
     return Pixbuf.new_from_file_at_size(filename, size, size)

   ```
   For now I just patched deluge's `get_pixbuf_at_size` (in `deluge\ui\gtk3\common.py`) and prepended the 4 lines to it:
   ```
   def get_pixbuf_at_size(filename, size):
       # current GdkPixbuf is broken somehow and crashes after loading some number of ico files
       if filename.endswith('.ico'):
           log.warning('Returning blank pixbuf instead of loading file: {}'.format(filename))
           return create_blank_pixbuf(size)

   ```
   That prevents the crash, but obviously means you won't see icons for trackers that use .ico.

3. The twisted `simulate` issue that has been mentioned previously.

4. Deluge 2 fails to load a state file from Deluge 1.3.x:
   ```
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "c:\apps\deluge2\venv\lib\site-packages\twisted\internet\base.py", line 1292, in mainLoop

     File "c:\apps\deluge2\venv\lib\site-packages\deluge\core\torrentmanager.py", line 812, in open_state
       state = pickle.load(_file)
   builtins.UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 19: ordinal not in range(128)

   ```
   This is likely only a problem when the state files contains non-ASCII, and can be worked around by manually converting the state file by opening a Python interpreter and running:
   ```
   import pickle
   with open('torrents.state', 'rb') as f:
       d = pickle.load(f, encoding='latin1')

   with open('torrents.state', 'wb') as f2:
       pickle.dump(d, f2)

   ```

5. When starting the daemon (deluged) when using the thin client, the daemon spawns a console window.

> That happens because it's started by `python` instead of `pythonw`, which could be solved upstream by moving the `deluged` entry point in `setup.py` to `gui_scripts`².

> It also seems like the extra entry point executables (`deluge-debug.exe`/`deluged-debug.exe`/`deluge-web-debug.exe`) specified in `setup.py` do not get installed.

> As workaround (for users who just want to get this working locally) running something like the following to convert the executable should work:
>
> ```
> # replace PYTHONDIR with the root of your Python installation
> with open(r'PYTHONDIR\Lib\site-packages\pip\_vendor\distlib\w64.exe', 'rb') as f:
>     launcher = f.read()
> with open(r'...\path\to\deluged.exe', 'rb') as f:
>     d = f.read()
> with open(r'...\path\to\deluged.exe', 'wb') as f:
>     f.write(launcher)
>     f.write(d[d.rindex(b'#!'):])
>
> ```

> But make a backup copy of deluged.exe first.

¹: `echo %errorlevel%` after it exits yields `-1073741819` (= `0xc0000005`)

²: Non-windows platforms should not be affected since `gui_scripts` are handled just like `console_scripts` there

In addition to my earlier comment, it also appears that the libtorrent provided by `deluge-libtorrent` (cf. [comment:9](/ticket/3201#comment:9 "Comment 9")) is not actually built/linked against OpenSSL, causing announces to https trackers to fail with `unsupported URL protocol`.

Good finding again, thank you! I omitted the OpenSSL files from my 7z-sfx-installer,because it didn't seem to make a difference if including them or not, though didn't even think of testing https-trackers(I kinda thought it just was used by deluge to communicate with its daemon encrypted or something and the files already where in the OS possibly.)

@tobbez, I accidentially asked you a question in wrong ticket, sorry, and I repost it here because you're not in the Cc list of that other ticket:

---

Do the code you posted for .5 work for you locally?

I used my deluge2 from Cas's install-instructions and because of admin-rights needed, I copied deluged.exe into my win10 VM's user(fooba) Downloads folder and changed your code to match my system and then runned it and it did change the file I could see from the file-properties, and then I overwrote deluged.exe from Downloads and back to correct place again(I did backup it first), but the result is same as before and I can see python and not pythonw.exe runs deluged.exe still and doesn't background itself.

I apologize in advance if messing up your instructions, as that is very likely ;)

```
# replace PYTHONDIR with the root of your Python installation
with open(r'C:\Program Files\Python36\Lib\site-packages\pip\_vendor\distlib\w64.exe', 'rb') as f:
    launcher = f.read()

@Paralel, I've built latest libtorrent for use with my deluge2 windows 7z-sfx-installer posted on deluge-forum, and including https-tracker-announcing support. It was pretty daunting and timeconsuming getting it to work, as never did it before and no windows user, but seemingly works fine.

Especially getting openssl support to work was hardest - there is a bug I believe with defaulting to x32, even though all components used are x64 and setup as x64, but still, and finally when using x32 version of openssl then it worked, because of said bug I believe. I believe Cas did things correctly, e.g. see: [​https://ci.appveyor.com/project/cas--/libtorrent/builds/20499246](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/cas--/libtorrent/builds/20499246) but just stumbled on same bug, and needing 32bit openssl, as with many runs of x64-openssl, and several different versions i.e tried 1.1.1, 1.1 and 1.0.2 and it didn't work, even though libtorrent is fixed to work with new names of dll's of openssl 1.1+. Ohh, newest boost didn't work for me, and I had go one version down.

Thank you so much! Exactly what I was looking for. I really appreciate it. If you ran into that kind of trouble, I can only imagine how awful it would have been for me to attempt it. Your work on the installer is also greatly appreciated.

@Paralel and others, I much apologise, but I found that I must have made a mistake previously, because I now managed to build libtorrent with x64 openssl libs, so I must have messed the added openssl build-options up I added to the config-file somehow. Still the command-prompt initially shows x32 mode as before and the boost build dir named bin.nt86 and not bin.nt86\_64, though 64bit address mode is specified on b2 command-line I can see, but I was wrong in my previous assumption that x64 openssl libs couldn't be picked up obviously.

The old libtorrent.pyd I posted works fine, and I tested specifically with https trackers which openssl relates to and makes supported, and that worked fine in previous version, but it just seemed more correct to use x64 openssl libs nonetheless, so here is the updated build, and I apologise again: [​http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file\_id=01545958734472286363](http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=01545958734472286363)

I'm sorry, there need to be 3 files added to same location as libtorrent.pyd which I previously posted zipped link too, which I didn't noticed before as already had them in my search-path.

Here's a zip with libtorrent.pyd and the three other needed deps, to unzip and overwrite in e.g. if using my installer: '%programfiles%\Deluge2\Lib\site-packages', and if using Cas's manual-install-instructions then the same path except exchange 'Deluge2' folder with 'Python36', and if you haven't installed python for all users, then instead of '%programfiles%, then '%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36', or something along those lines.

Sorry for inconvenience and oversight again, and I will not spam this ticket more if finding other issues, and so if using this, then please instead check my thread on deluge-forum for more updates if other issues should occure.

Since Cas's install instructions in this thread results in not being able to announce to https trackers, then i'm trying to build libtorrent v1.1.13 with openssl, but even without openssl, then it doesn't work right in deluge2 for me, even though I can import it fine in a python terminal still outside of deluge2. I can build latest libtorrent v1.2.2 and run in deluge2 fine, but just not v1.1.13, and don't get it.

The strange thing also, is that often then right after building it, then when adding it to deluge2 and firering it up, then deluge2 start fine with it, but then if disconnecting from daemon and closing deluge2 and starting it again, then it never works regardless of how many times trying. It shows an error 10061 of connection actively refused by destination computer, and loading it into dependency walker and profiling it(deluged.exe), shows this error:

```
Second chance exception 0xE06D7363 (Microsoft C++ Exception) occurred in "KERNELBASE.DLL" at address 0x00007FFB59ED50D8.

```

In the debug-log of deluge2 it states:

```

```

(The danish part means that there couldn't be made a connection because destination computer actively refused it - I also just in case tried disabling firewall, but didn't help either)

I have tried 5 different boost versions, where most give linking errors, which either is online reported to be unresolved or fixed by changing boost version. I know using boost over v1.66 needs a patch added to jamfile to support python3 or something along those lines, but I do add that also, which makes it run, but fails later with linking errors. I usually stick to v1.66 because was reported by a libtorrent dev to be recommended as didn't need patches, and using that, makes it be imported every time in a terminal, but just not in deluge2, except often right after the building. I always include runtime files needed, and also tried b2 option of static runtime linking, but again without any change.

I use python v3.68, and msvc-build-tools latest version 2019(14.23), but have tried also 2017 edition(v14.16), and change setup.py to reflect the proper msvc version, which is added to b2 command-line then, and address-model=64 I also use, and again, I build libtorrent v1.2.2 with openssl fine, and doesn't have this issue and always connects in deluge2, but it does however still show a connection error or two of the one posted above, but always connects fine anyway, as 5 or 6 of those is supported before failing I can see.

Thanks alot in advance, as this is driving me freakin' crazy soon, as have run 100 test of this now I'd guess, in the last weeks time or so.

Has anyone had an success getting pyinstaller to work?

Also since people seem to have trouble I made a guide kinda of with information/scripts to completely compile deluge and its dependencies from source. That can be found here: [​https://github.com/doadin/DelugeBuildFromSource](https://github.com/doadin/DelugeBuildFromSource) It is a little bit excessive since it compiles EVERYTHING but can adapt and modify as you see fit.

Sorry no, but just wanted to say thanks alot for your scripts, great stuff indeed, which I'll be sure to link to on the forum, whenever people ask for deluge2 on windows. I was looking through Cas's github to see how he build gtk3 for deluge(gvsbuild) as was thinking about making a new and up to date with recent fixes gtk3, to include in my "installer", and also possibly with py3.8 as I wanted to upgrade to that anyways and then need pygobject wheel for py3.8 which isn't available online anywhere, and when trying building pygobject alone, with py3.8, then it errors out with a missing Lib linking error, on several different msvc build tools versions.

Sorry for blabbing on here, and just wanted to say that your efforts, past and present are greatly appreciated. (I was also looking into possibly using, if figuring out how such works, your updated bbfreeze, but am a total beginner in stuff like this unfortunately :) )

when I tried pyinstaller I got a spec file and it got all the dependencies(or so it looks like) however it said it couldn't find distribution Deluge. So I must not be giving it the right entry point or something. However the hooks they have all ready established seem to pick up everything just fine. And I have been using deluge 2 on windows just fine so I think its really close to being able to get a windows release going just needs a little work.

[​https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) has packages for both the Python 3 and GTK 3. I wonder if this can be leveraged somehow. Just my two cents.

I have now added a spec file to my gihthub repository linked above for building from source. With this spec file its possible to freeze deluge using pyinstaller. The resulting dist freezes shortly after the main window loads still trying to figure that out.

If you start in thin client mode the connection dialog is completely usable its only the main window that is frozen, seems like the issue is in the main window.

Thanks Paralel for the notice.

For all, until Cas has time to upload a new tarball, then you can either build it yourself, using doadin's repo he presented a couple posts above, with batchfiles for building from source: deluge, libtorrent, gvsbuild and openssl:

[​https://github.com/doadin/DelugeBuildFromSource](https://github.com/doadin/DelugeBuildFromSource)

Or, alternatively i've up'ed the tarball in question, though link get's disabled after 30 days without downloads, so contact me if link dies later on, and i'll re'up it:

Hi,

I cannot believe that almost a year later, Deluge 2 for Windows is still not available.
Is this project completely abandoned? Anyway, I'm trying to compile it myself but...

Compiling with the latest tools (Visual Studio Enterprise 2019, Python 3.8+ x64 latest) FAILS!

Is this a legacy application that requires Python 3.6?

Can somebody please reup all the dependencies to some credible file hosting site as ALL the links are down?

Lack of volunteered manpower obviously means less releases/work in these types of projects, especially on windows, where there's even less manpower, and when issues additionally puts a hold on things. Releases don't simply come flying through the thin air magically. Very first post asked for help from community, which came, but not nearly enough. However, I'm also surpriced not more volunteered help for such a popular project has occurred, but that's just the sad reality.

If wanna see if abandoned project then check git commit log of development branch. It's not abandoned, just pretty slow at times, but just recently picked up again.

If you're talking about building libtorrent python bindings, then I can confirm it works with msvc-2019 toolset and python 3.8.2. I personally have best results with boost 1.70 for libtorrent 1.2.x, and 1.66 with 1.1.x.

Im not at my computer now, but tomorrow I'll upload pygobject and pycairo latest wheels for py38 and in some other py versions, which I believe I still have, and an updated gvsbuild gtk3 archive of latest gtk3.24.20. Pycairo is already at the gohlke wheels site, but not pygobject unfortunetly, which is harder to find online and need build your own, but as said I'll post them tomorrow.

I didn't have py36 wheels anymore, sorry, but here's pycairo and pygobject for py37 and py38, though py37 is not newest version though: [​http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file\_id=73322123121773264450](http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=73322123121773264450)

You don't need the other wheels, as already on pypi, so only need these two.

Gtk3.24.20 zipped archive. Note I omitted the x64 folder, so omit the x64 part when following instructions from Cas to add gvsbuild to path: [​https://gofile.io/?c=LatBqY](https://gofile.io/?c=LatBqY)

If just wanting readymade deluge 2.0.3 from pypi, then just 'pip install' the two wheel's and 'deluge', though remember a libtorrent(I believe one is on pypi too, if not wanting build yourself) and runtimes installed.

Also, here's prebuilt libtorrent latest 1.2.x(1.2.6) and 1.1.x(1.1.14), which can be dropped into python's 'Lib\site-packages' folder: [​http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file\_id=00000203889311879236](http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=00000203889311879236)

Also, to avoid runtimes-install, then you can drop these two files into the bin folder of gvsbuild that you add to path: [​http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file\_id=03819964817140265822](http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=03819964817140265822)

Last, if deluge fails starting, then delete session.state file from deluge profile folder if having such, which is an old deluge bug.

Ish4d0w, try checking the forum before complaining on the tickets here.

MHertz and the other Dev's have done plenty of work. MHertz has essentially taken the herculean task of creating a functional windows installer solely on his shoulders since Sept. 2019 and subsequently produced an incredible installer. Literally all the major issues have been solved, even most of the minor issues have been solved. As of the last few months all of the dependent packages are completely up to date. Honestly, MHertz installer should just be designated the official Windows installer. There is really no good reason not to at this point.

So, since we have what is essentially a complete, fully functional up-to-date installer, you shouldn't really be complaining.

Paralel, I dropped my jaw reading your post there! :) Thanks alot for the kind words my friend, really appreciate that and you're way to kind there, but did make my day nonetheless! Thank you! :)

**mhertz - Excellent! Thank you very much for your answer'''**

Paralel: well... Yes, you are right - I should have checked it and I didn't. But since the official webpage **denies** the existence of a Windows installer and directs to this ticket where the last post was months old without an installer link - here I am.

I did not know that there is an installer. I didn't know it because the most likely place where I could find it simply says there isn't one and that I have to build it from packages myself so that's what I was attempting to do.
It's not the fact whether this installer official or not (it should be designated official though), it's rather the fact that the website needs updating... the very least that the maintainer of the website should do is to erase the sentence seen below and/or state that there are 3rd-party installers available".

At the moment it goes like this in case you haven't seen this, Paralel:
"Deluge 2.0 packages are not yet available, please see [docs]
Unfortunately due to move to GTK3 and Python 3 there is no installer package currently available for Windows. Intrepid users can install Deluge from separate packages as detailed in issue [#3201](/ticket/3201 "#3201: feature-request: Create Windows package (Py3-GTK3) (closed: Fixed)"). [this ticket]"

I understand if the maintainer is busy. But in case he/she is that busy that they cannot update it in like 8 months then perhaps somebody else should be doing that.

I'm sorry for not discovering the installer, I fell by the false information found on the home page.
I really appreciate the fact that MHertz and other Dev's took the time to finish the job - thank you to them and I'm definitely not complaining about/to them. I'm complaining about the maintainer of the webpage, that's it.

Thank you once again MHertz! Both for the installer and for the provided packages. Excellent job.

I have while questionably very poorly tried to help with the windows side of things though I will also admit my python skills are very much lacking, hence unable to contribute to the limiting factor in getting a official installer. That being said and also said not trying to down play MHertz's efforts. Without knowing any details of why im sure theres probabbly a list of reasons why the, I guess one would call it a "portal python install", method MHertz has used, of distributing python apps is not the way to go and things like pyexe pyinstaller bbfreze etc etc have come to be. One reason I do know is the install being ~20% larger then needed.(As compaired myself with my build which is closer to official installer(only freezer changed rest updated) and the unofficial installer)

Ish4d0w, in that case, I owe you an apology, I didn't realize the main page was quite that out of date. As such, I apologize. I shouldn't expect people to just find things here when they aren't directed to such.

ish4d0w, thanks mate, appreciate that! :)

Doadin, "portal python install" is a very acurate description indeed :) Although a freezed install is the same I would say. I got bored a reducing the size after the first several 100mb's of trial and error(though mostly gtk3 stuff), so could be reduced further. After the change to py38, then the portable install should be isolated from outside pretty good too. However, I have stated several times that I don't think that the unofficial installer should be official in any way, as not done in ordinary professional fashion like Doadin stated, and has always been ment as simply something to try if wanted, in mean time, that's all, and never anything more. I hope it's clear that when I say thank you and that a post makes me happy, then it's because I am gratefull for the appreciation and nice words and not because I agree in making it official, quite the opposite actually, but I didn't see any reason to keep reiterating it, after the first several times, though honestly does makes me happy to hear, to be totally honest, but still not wise. If nothing else, then Cas and other devs shouldn't be getting bug-reports of possibly something i've myself done to screw something up, or whatever I have added or not added from other people, and as said, not a "real" installer, but a glorified manual portable source install, but just thought better than nothing, in the waiting time, which im sure we can all agree upon. Well, of-course manually installing from source yourself would be better, but I mean for people not able to do that, and e.g. there linux seedbox got updated to 2.0.x in meantime. Also, my efforts has for the vast majority been to include other peoples talented work into the unofficial installer, or googling stuff and taking bits and pieces, again from others, so please don't think that I have done something special here, and the ones who ows the real thanks is Cas, Doadin and co :)

About python >= 3.8 and deluge:

You need deluge 2.04 to fix an issue with an added argument to the logger module, and you also need to upgrade twisted to the latest version, above 20 I think, to have the same fix in twisted.

I had to manually force the upgrade to twisted.

Sorry, I'm an idiot seemingly, as forgot to say that, so thank you jools772 for elaborating. Twisted 19.7.0 and above. I use latest 20.3.0 succesfully. For deluge 2.0.3, backport from development branch into master/2.0.3:

Allow me to rephrase. The 'Associate Magnet Links" button from the installation these instructions created does not function correctly. If someone had a registry file that will be implemented into the installer this thread is working on it would be appreciated.

The magnet assoc button in deluge2 GTKUI code, looks like don't set anything if already having HKCR/magnet set(though could be wrong, with my limited knowledge of this, so apologize in advance if false, though did do quick test which seemingly backed it up i.e button didn't do anything, deleted key, button worked again), so if having that, e.g pointed to something uninstalled, then delete HKCR/magnet e.g with regedit/reg.exe, press button in GTKUI and possibly restart computer, or atleast restart browser.

If continue have issues,then different solutions in this thread here: [​https://forum.deluge-torrent.org/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=55037](https://forum.deluge-torrent.org/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=55037)

I agree off-topic, but still much talk done on various faults found during manual source install, so hope I'm not disturbing too much here, with this posting :)

Hi mate, thanks for the links - I've downloaded your links and followed the instructions as per [​https://dev.deluge-torrent.org/ticket/3201#comment:9](https://dev.deluge-torrent.org/ticket/3201#comment:9)

I ended up downloading the twisted & setproctitle. My commands are:

```
pip.exe install C:\gvsbuild\release\python\pycairo-1.18.2-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl
pip.exe install C:\gvsbuild\release\python\pycairo-1.19.1-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl
pip.exe install C:\gvsbuild\release\python\PyGObject-3.34.0-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl
pip.exe install C:\gvsbuild\release\python\PyGObject-3.36.0-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl
pip.exe install C:\gvsbuild\release\python\Twisted-20.3.0-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl
pip.exe install C:\gvsbuild\release\python\setproctitle-1.1.10-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl

```

But I get this error on all of the installs.

```
ERROR: PyGObject-3.34.0-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform.

```

I have installed Python 3.8
Any help would be great!

You only need one each of pycairo and pygobject, and in your python version installed, so omit the two redundant ones(line 1 and 3 above), but however shouldn't matter in your example though, as the correct version would be installed and wrong ones erroring out, like in your report.

Are non-programmers able to drop in newer libtorrents an option for existing installations - can someone take 1.2.6 from the zip and put it in the appropriate folder? Does anyone have a prebuilt Windows build with the latest libtorrent? Or, is someone willing to provide a condensed set of some updated compile instructions (that aren't across 70 comments)? TIA

It's mostly patience and understanding the use of a compiler, if you run into troubles, you'll probably find a patch somewhere to solve the issue.

you need the corresponding msvc compiler with python version and compile the latest openssl since libtorrent needs that.

Also the libtorrent version has to be supported by Deluge

For safety reasons I also compiled an openssl for Deluge, but that version needs to be supported by Deluge

I have a good guide on the forum you can adjust with this knowledge :)

Hi Corhsin,

I have built them using MHerz's scripts (improved), with:

* latest deluge 2.0.4dev 38 (2.0.3 also available)
* latest libtorrent 1.2.7 (1.1.x and 1.2.3 also available, selectable during install)
* latest libboost 1.73.0
* latest openSSL 1.1.1g
* latest Python 3.8.3
* almost latest GTK 3.24.20

Yes, we (MHerz & I) are already building our own GTK, maybe I should put our set of scripts on github?

That's great progress :)

I didn't follow how far you guys have gotten :)
I'm glad that there is some movement in this
Now I hope the deluge devs chime in on approving this.

IMHO I think this can work as an official build in the future.

Major update to the unofficial Windows installer here: [​https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bCwij\_GEy8nhqR6EynXYY\_Yl7XuWYpVT](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bCwij_GEy8nhqR6EynXYY_Yl7XuWYpVT)

1. One third smaller installer and Installed Deluge folder through profiling of deluge, deluged, deluge-web and deluge-console using Process Monitor and removing the files not used according to the profiling.

> EXCEPTIONS: .exe files; folders that have 'locale' or 'hazmat' in their name.
> PLEASE test and let me know if I have removed too much!!!

2. Better Windows integration through alternative loaders, courtesy of MHerz:
   * Now can pin deluge on taskbar
   * Shows only one deluge / deluged / deluge-web process, python[w].exe is embedded.
   * Loader has Deluge icons.
3. Updated LibTorrent to 1.2.8 released 30-Jul-2020.
4. Updated to Python to version 3.8.5 released on 20-Jul-2020.
5. Portable install fix to put the deluge profile folder as well in the deluge folder in case of portable installations, courtesy of MHerz.
6. Updated te GeoIP database and added the automated GeoIP database update to the build system, courtesy of MHerz.
7. Fixed a torrentmanager.py patch in the stable deluge-build.
8. Install wheel using pip during deluge-build to avoid build warnings.
9. Removed LIBTORRENT\_REVISION from the file names as it seems useless. Other installer name fixes.
10. Stopped copying the vcvarsall.bat around to make the LibTorrent build happy using proper build commands.
11. Added up to date LibTorrent-ChangeLog.txt, GTK-3.24-ChangeLog.txt and Python-ChangeLog.txt to the "Deluge2 Unofficial Installer for Windows" folder to make it easy for you to check what fixes are included in the new version.
12. Moved earlier releases to an Archive folder.

Hi, I have finally published the build scripts and artifacts with a brief guide:

### [comment:89](#comment:89) by mhertz, [4 years ago](/timeline?from=2021-02-10T21%3A04%3A46Z&precision=second "See timeline at 02/10/2021 09:04:46 PM")

Please forgive me for off-topic, but just wanted to add that I upped my deluge2 build-scripts on my github around 5 months ago, and just didn't announce it because wasen't ment to compete with petersasi's new maintainership, and just ment for posting my fixes if needed, but as he's busy at the moment, then I thought I might as well post a link, so if interrested people can build deluge2 with latest python 3.9.x, deps and installers, and works as of now atleast.

**Again, note is not made in normal professional way, as still not possible because issues, but is just something to mess with if wanted, untill real official release emerges, using proper building techniques. -Don't blame Cas or other of the devs for my possible mistakes!**

I now use the embedded python zip distribution, scripts can be run from any path/location, not needing admin rights, except initially install\_components.cmd raise UAC dialog for installing msvc. All components extracted in build-dir instead of installed on system, except msvc which needs installing, but is installed into build-dir and when selecting uninstall\_components.cmd, then it's uninstalled from there, so not wiping your own msvc install if having such. Because of msvc you need a few GB of space for this.

Note, I have extra deluge2 repo's for win7 and x86, which worked at one time, but I haven't bothered updating them to python 3.9.x etc, so shouldn't be tried, unless updating scripts yourself manually. Main repo is win10 x64 only.

I hope petersasi returns again to take over maintainership, or if other windows user would release installers on the forum, then would be appreciated, as don't know how long i'm gonna mess with this here more, as since said, not windows user myself.

Last, there's sometimes missing files reported or warnings, which can be disregarded, as i'm pretty lazy and sometimes don't bother make checks, or correct warnings if doesn't affect end-result anyways, so just cosmetics. If build finishes with a built product, then it did work.

## Why IPFS?

### Our peer-to-peer content delivery network is built around the innovation of content addressing: store, retrieve, and locate data based on the fingerprint of its actual content rather than its name or location.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)
### Open

The IPFS network is distributed and participatory, which reduces the problem of data silos that plague central servers.

![](/_nuxt/constellation-verifiable.BUIOD6a2.svg)
### Verifiable

The integrity of all data is verified using hash functions, so you can trust that you always get the data youâre looking for.

![](/_nuxt/constellation-resilient.CJumKkYl.svg)
### Resilient

Files and data can be stored across multiple nodes, which keeps content at the ready even during critical outages.

 [Learn how it works](/developers/) ![](/_nuxt/constellations-home-get-started.B7ZaHEIB.svg)
## Get Started

### Join thousands of developers who choose IPFS to build software thatâs open, verifiable, and resilient.

### Build peer-to-peer apps with IPFS

Our most popular implementations are written in Go, Rust, and JavaScript â and we also have support for desktop, browsers, mobile, embedded devices, and more.

Unfortunately jabber.ru is running server software from 2016, and that old version doesn't support it. Pinning is problematic these days, because certificates are short-lived and renewed frequently. Users would be constantly asked to accept new certificates on a monthly basis, and they wouldn't think twice about clicking 'Accept' on an attacker's certificate then. Channel binding works regardless of the certificate, and ensures the TLS stream is terminated by the entity you exepect. The focus on (lack of) CT/SCT support in XMPP clients puzzles me, because it would not have detected this attack at all, which used valid CT-logged certs from Let's Encrypt. SCT verification would help detect theoretical issuance from another CA if they had a strict CAA record in place (they did not). But even then, channel binding is more privacy-friendly and does not depend on a third party. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [knorker](user?id=knorker) [on Oct 21, 2023](item?id=37964854)   | [root](#37962383) | [parent](#37964717) | [next](#37966693) [–]  Pinnig is based on the keypair, not the cert.

But most ACME clients (including the "official" certbot) default to rotating the key too. That can be disabled, but it's a problematic default for this use case which means clients can't just enable pinning. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [rhn\_mk1](user?id=rhn_mk1) [on Oct 21, 2023](item?id=37965363)   | [root](#37962383) | [parent](#37964971) | [next](#37966693) [–]  How can it be disabled in certbot? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [natebc](user?id=natebc) [on Oct 21, 2023](item?id=37965421)   | [root](#37962383) | [parent](#37965363) | [next](#37966693) [–]   ```   --reuse-key           When renewing, use the same private key as the                         existing certificate.

That is what XMPP clients tend to do... These days XMPP servers tend to default to requiring TLS on both 5222 and 5223 (Let's Encrypt has changed everything). Prosody does this for example. It doesn't even support port 5223 by default anymore. Port 5223 was never an official port assignment. So it is very possible that the MiTM was only done on port 5222 because that was the only port that clients were using. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [KirillPanov](user?id=KirillPanov) [on Oct 21, 2023](item?id=37963588)   | [root](#37962383) | [parent](#37963431) | [prev](#37966043) | [next](#37971429) [–]  Easier to conceal the attack. The MiTM attacker can pass through a command stream without STARTTLS. If they intercepted 5223 they would have to do their own client-side TLS handshake with the attacked server, which would look really obvious to anybody doing TLS fingerprinting on the server: all of a sudden, 100% of their clients have the exact same TLS fingerprint. Stop outsourcing your PKI to ICANN, folks.

But you would be hard-pressed to find an XMPP server that would allow authentication without TLS.

So, because it is legacy, clients would, by default, use 5222 + starttls. I.e. majority of clients connect with 5222. Also, I've never understood why they've moved 5223 (regular TLS) into deprecated. It was pretty useful to enable SSL on AWS ELB on this port. Which is not possible with 5222, because it does XML stuff before switching to TLS. I would speculate it is to not keep 2 ports open or something, was a reason to move it to deprecated. + you can do some cleartext communication before switching to TLS (not like it is that useful). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [simpaticoder](user?id=simpaticoder) [on Oct 21, 2023](item?id=37963258)   | [parent](#37962383) | [prev](#37963431) | [next](#37962604) [–]  *>The attacker managed to issue multiple SSL/TLS certificates via Let’s Encrypt* This implies that the attacker was able to validate domain ownership of jabber.ru and xmpp.ru by either a) being able to respond to the ACME protocol on domain(s) hosted http OR b) being able to write to a DNS TXT file for the domain(s).

The next level of mitigating that sort of a thing is to have keys not be on the hosts at all. Enter HSM - Hardware Security Module. A wildly complex topic I cannot hope to cover in an HN comment, but fundamentally, the private keys are not on the same HW as the server software which needs them. A fundamental property of an HSM is that you, the HSM user, don't actually see the private key. You can ask the HSM to generate one. Derive things from it (in the cryptographic sense of derive). Even prove the provenance of such derived data. But the HSM should not reveal the actual private key. In the cloud world, the HSM equivalent is known as KMS (Key Management Service), and the Good cloud providers all let you manage your own (with the downside being that you now need to manage your own keys). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [fulafel](user?id=fulafel) [on Oct 21, 2023](item?id=37963855)   | [root](#37962383) | [parent](#37963692) | [prev](#37963879) | [next](#37965565) [–]  Here's a good example why trust is not binary ("you either trust Hetzner or don't").

My understanding is that certificate pinning is only possible if you control the clients, in which case you can embed which certificates are allowed directly in the client and bypass the whole web PKI. In a situation with general-purpose clients connecting, how would they know which certificates are meant to be allowed? That's what the web PKI is used for. Of course, if you do provide your own clients, this just moves the problem further up the chain - in this case the place where customers would download the custom client software would be compromised and a malicious client served instead. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [LeoPanthera](user?id=LeoPanthera) [on Oct 20, 2023](item?id=37962673)   | [root](#37962383) | [parent](#37962604) | [next](#37962874) [–]  > How would you do certificate pinning if you don't control the clients?

I think the more likely scenario is that someone was to catch carders/botnet operators, since Jabber/XMPP is still very popular amongst people in that scene in Russia; you'll see often see screenshots or logs containing @exploit.in, @jabber.ru, and various other servers pretty much in any Krebs on Security article, for example. That said, I think mass-surveillance is usually pretty gross regardless of intent. I don't know what the exact ratio of criminal to non-criminal usage of either server is, but just like how Tor simultaneously has a ton of obviously illegal content mixed with whatever percentage of legitimate use [1], they presumably still do have a fair amount of totally normal conversations going on. And so I'm not an exactly a huge fan of invading privacy in order to spy on random cybercriminals likely far out of your jurisdiction in countries unwilling to extradite in the first place. And while I *understand* if Hetzner was *forced* to comply, unless they wanted to become another Lavabit, as someone who recommends them often, it'll still be a little disappointing, IMO, if it turns out they were aware and allowed or assisted in the MitM attack, because otherwise, I think they're one of the best hosting companies. Their transparency is great. And I get better uptime, reliability, and support than the overwhelming majority of cloud providers without selling my organs to afford it. And their effort put into turning environmentally-friendly design choices into economically smart choices is commendable. The "reduce" in reduce > reuse > recycle can be seen in their KISS designs—like the raised, angled roof, allowing natural heat escape rather than loads of HVAC [2]; server chassises that are more bare-minimum structural support and air-shrouds than actual chassises; and stripped-down standard motherboard designs with only the most minimal changes, like 90-degree rotated sockets to allow a single fan to cool the VRM, CPU, and memory [3], rather than a dozen screaming, power-slurping Delta fans for every server. And their knowledge of "reuse" is evident by their server auctions, where they do Dutch-auction-style rentals of legacy hardware rather than scrapping everything, avoiding spending a load on new hardware while also avoiding the environmental cost associated with manufacturing new everything each generation. I'd love to be able use them more if only they had dedicated servers outside of Europe.

All CAs worth their salt are already publishing all certificates to CT logs because most TLS servers are browsers and most clients are browsers. Maybe there's a CA somewhere that has opt-in CT logging enabled, but I don't think they're very popular. For example, even the rogue CA certificates were published onto the CT log (because Let's Encrypt does so by default). I think a CT check shouldn't be a very problematic change in practice, as long as there are reasonable exemptions (i.e. don't require CT for certificates imported into the CA store, allow the user to disable the check, etc.). For server<->server communication things become more difficult, but the entire network would be better off if a major server like ejabberd were to require CT. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [pabs3](user?id=pabs3) [on Oct 21, 2023](item?id=37965331)   | [prev](#37962629) | [next](#37962300) [–]  This article suggests using OTR with XMPP, unfortunately OTRv3 is using obsolete crypto and OTRv4 hasn't been finalised. <https://dustri.org/b/time-to-sunset-otr.html> | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [abigail95](user?id=abigail95) [on Oct 20, 2023](item?id=37962300)   | [prev](#37965331) | [next](#37962716) [–]  > What would a perfect attacker do?

This kind of passive, default-compliant attitude from service providers, while understandable from a "path of least resistance" standpoint, is exactly the kind of behavior that allows the third party doctrine to circumvent so many of our basic rights. As a service provider, often the more difficult path is to challenge authority, rather than to cooperate with it. And unfortunately that means that most service providers will simply cooperate. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [skissane](user?id=skissane) [on Oct 22, 2023](item?id=37971696)   | [root](#37962300) | [parent](#37968642) | [next](#37974552) [–]  > No, you don't.

And outside of nation-state requests, even ignoring the fact that someone could probably pay-off an employee, I think ease would depend a lot on the datacenter and target; judging by the awesome and hilarious story behind the Fremont Cabal accidentally becoming an internet exchange by essentially having some dude barely secretly slipping unauthorized cables into the raceways [1], I figure there are a lot of places where if your target is simply renting a couple rack units or single rack rather than an entire locked cage, you can probably get physical access by doing the same. Also, a lot of Deviant Ollam's stories about industrial security and the dozens of ways he's broken into utility companies, server rooms, etc — mostly just by being confident, looking the part, bad doors [2], and badge cloning [3] — don't give me a ton of confidence that someone with skill couldn't feasibly either get direct access to servers they shouldn't, or at the very least, access to an important part of the supply chain for their target. And speaking of supply chain, my processor died recently, so I ordered a brand-new in box replacement Ryzen, and when it arrived last night, out of curiosity, I wanted to see if I could get the CPU out of the box without breaking the tamper-evident authenticity seal... ... and about fifteen minutes later, after borrowing a syringe and hypodermic needle from my mom, a little bit of isopropyl alcohol, a blade from my safety razor, and a quick look at a video from LockPickingLawyer [4] and a couple from datagram at DEFCON's Tamper-Evident Village [5][6], I had the CPU out, put my old one for now, and re-applied the sticker with no visible damage to the box or seal. All I had to do was tip it upside down at about 90-degrees, douse a little bit of the alcohol under the top of the seal, let gravity do most of the work, and then carefully lift the seal with the razor. After that, I just lightly squeezed the box to make the front tab come as forward as possible, and then carefully pushed the ear flaps down to prevent tearing, and then I was in. I've seen others demonstrate it on older AMD boxes that had flexible cardboard in-place of the cooler, allowing them to pull the cardboard to make enough room for tools to get out the CPU without even touching the seal [7]. But in my case, it was a newer box with hard plastic inside where the cooler would've been, so that's why I went for the seal instead. No surprise to me now that counterfeiting is rampant on Amazon, with people returning the box after putting in either random junk, dead Athlons covered by a counterfeit serial-matching IHS, or the cheapest socket-compatible CPU after deluding both and swapping the IHS. I figure with a bit of practice and better tools, like Teflon spudgers and syringes, it'd be significantly easier to get past 99% of tamper-resistant/tamper-evident seals and into boxes you're not supposed to be without risking damage, and then you can intercept a package, compromise something critical, like the server BMC or firmware, reseal everything, and be on your way. And given the relatively recent scare with loads of servers, including Dell and others, being shipped with "AMERICAN MEGA*TRANDS*" labels on their BMC boards, with no one noticing until a YouTube commenter pointed it out during a teardown by ServeTheHome, I think it's totally feasible for an enemy to just compromise the entire physical supply-chain of a company, datacenter, or whatever else [8].

I'm not super up-to-date on what's being offered right now, but I'm not sure if there is a way to have a proper trusted execution environment on most Intel or AMD offerings; I thought Secure Boot on AMD64 platforms generally rely on TPM or something like SGX for validation, with the former having seemingly a dozen different ways to be tampered with, and the latter being discontinued and being vulnerable to several different attacks, including DOWNFALL. I think EPYC and Sapphire Rapids have some sort of Trusted Execution Environment stuff with SEV-SNP and TDX, maybe? But I don't think either option is really feasible for people paying Hetzner-like prices for hosting; Hetzner's newest Xeon offering is seemingly Cascade Lake, and the only EPYC offered is a single-socket Rome 7502P with 128GB DDR4 for 142 euros, which seems very hard to justify, given they also offer a 7950X3D with 128GB DDR5 for ~25 euros less. Even then, I don't think I could put my confidence in a machine I don't own, didn't setup, can't physically inspect, don't know where it came from, whether the firmware has been tampered with, etc -- especially if it is something as complex as x86, where there is seemingly at least one new horrific hardware-level vulnerability that crops up every generation or two. EDIT: I forgot Hetzner also started offering Ampere Altra servers for 200 euros. I think those have TEE of some sort with the TrustZone stuff? Not sure how secure that really is, though; I haven't really looked into the ARM offerings as much as I should have, mostly since, if you don't want Apple, I'm not aware of a good middle-ground between a cheap SBC and a $3,000+ Ampere server, outside of jerry-rigging some second-hand Gigabyte Cavium ThunderX2 nodes off eBay. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [dist-epoch](user?id=dist-epoch) [on Oct 21, 2023](item?id=37962858)   | [root](#37962482) | [parent](#37962632) | [prev](#37963072) | [next](#37963152) [–]  Only if secure boot was enabled by a trusted party on trusted hardware.

Quite a shame though, because Hetzner definitely seems to provide a superior service - provided you can get them to take your business! | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [penumbra\_3](user?id=penumbra_3) [on Oct 21, 2023](item?id=37963761)   | [parent](#37963542) | [prev](#37964364) | [next](#37965391) [–]  When was this?

Yes, many service providers need to ascertain your identity. In my experience, passport photo verification is normal at Hetzner, Hetzner is very aware that not everyone wants to meet the requirements for their service, and they will happily refund you if you decide not to proceed. This passport verification is required in Germany for any Internet connection. You need to do the same if you sign up for a cellphone plan in Germany. It's a surveillance state. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [petre](user?id=petre) [on Oct 21, 2023](item?id=37964297)   | [parent](#37963542) | [prev](#37974389) | [next](#37970183) [–]  They had the option to send it encrypted with PGP.

You've got the general issue of abuse and fraud that all providers face. But I think there are two issues that make it worse for companies like Hetzner, OVH, and other low-cost providers: 1. Chargebacks are a big deal, both in terms of being cut off from payment networks but also the fees imposed, which are especially harsh if your margins are likely razor thin sometimes; looking at the server auctions right now, it's kind of wild that Hetzner manages to give you a place in a datacenter, 3700X, 64GB RAM, 2x1TB enterprise SSDs, and unmetered gigabit on a decent network for 33 euros while still making a profit. 2. I would imagine that attempting the proper credit-card theft kind of fraud is also more of an issue for low-cost providers, not only because of #1, but because I think you'd manage to keep and abuse servers bought with stolen money for a lot longer; I think legitimate owners of said cards are less likely to notice 30 euro charges every month compared to being robbed blind by unexpected AWS fees. I've had to deal with anti-fraud paranoia from OVH, BuyVM, Hetzner, and many others, likely all for the same reasons as Hetzner. Both Hetzner and OVH refused to provide me service without photo ID or a passport. BuyVM refused one of my Jordanian friends entirely unless he paid in crypto. And while minor in comparison, I've had to change my PayPal email to match my account email on BuyVM despite it literally previously being paypal@myfirstandlastname.tld. Not meant to be a dig at BuyVM, btw, even though the crypto bit may seem harsh. I really like them; freedom to host pretty much anything that isn't straight-up illegal, even Tor exit nodes, the support is good, they're often around and transparent in the community chat, and it's hard to beat free BGP announces, up to 10Gbps speeds, anycasted VMs across Europe and the US for <$10/month, and optional $3/month DDoS mitigation -- especially since it's the kind of small enough, tight-ship type of thing to where you can moan about poor routing or custom mitigation filters and potentially have someone actually try to take care of it (and it's also hard to beat for abusive or awful clients too, hence the trouble). They provide great service, even if only to use as a DDoS-mitigated tunnel for more powerful servers elsewhere, or as a CDN, etc. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [immibis](user?id=immibis) [on Oct 22, 2023](item?id=37974425)   | [root](#37963542) | [parent](#37964665) | [next](#37968756) [–]  BuyVM comes off as one of those sites that's explicitly set up to host illegal content, but with plausible deniability. I don't understand how they're still allowed to remain operating. Governments usually err on the side of arresting innocent people. P.S.

Most of them have a fill in the blanks sheet with name address and document s/n. I can understand scanning documents if one rents a vehicle, although for hotels I fail to see why the form shouldn't be enough. It's not like they don't have cameras at the reception desk and I don't pay with a card under my name, they can also check my ID and fill in the form themselves if they don't trust the customer. Why should I trust them to properly handle copies of my ID? They are not a bank operating under strict regulation. The thing is back then they were *physically* keeping your ID until you've paid in full and checked out. Last time it happened to us in Serbia, in 2019. The receptionist regarded us with suspicion. Brought back memories from the '80s. If you've played *Papers Please* you know what I mean. Now about 8 Schengen Area states have introduced border checks. Great.

That didn't happen to me when I stayed a month in an Airbnb in Serbia, although the host did ask me for a copy of my passport. (Not that I'd expect it from an Airbnb host even if hotels were doing it... just an additional data point). For renting a vehicle (or more likely, something like a bike or moped), I can understand why they take your ID as a form of collateral in exchange for the material goods they're lending you. But for a hotel there's no real reason to hold onto it. Out of curiosity, did you acquiesce and leave your passport with them? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [orhmeh09](user?id=orhmeh09) [on Oct 21, 2023](item?id=37964394)   | [root](#37963542) | [parent](#37964297) | [prev](#37968756) | [next](#37964616) [–]  What does this have to do with lingering Stasi mentality?

Nobody is going to waste energy and time to attack your blog with your vacation photos. The huge wave of DDoS extortion attacks that happened 3-4 years ago was mostly enabled by "booter" services that themselves hid from law enforcement behind Cloudflare. Here is an example: [https://therecord.media/feds-seize-ddos-booter-sites-in-late...](https://therecord.media/feds-seize-ddos-booter-sites-in-latest-takedown) Feel free to punch any of the sites they mention into dns.coffee and look at the historical nameservers.

More often than not, every time I run into the run-of-the-mill booter or other super blatantly illegal things, at least some portion of the infrastructure is behind CloudFlare. I don't have enough fingers and toes to count the number of abuse reports I've personally filed that seemingly go nowhere. OVH at least takes down the booters and other proper malicious stuff. However, copyright infringement reports go ignored to the point to where I stopped bothering--not that I had any right to care when I torrented loads, but it was a little annoying that ~$10 software, with no DRM, regional discounts, and a dozen ways to pay still ended up pirated to the point to where it wasn't worth selling (fun story: I still have email records from when a pretty beloved multi-billion dollar tech company launched their ROG-clone sub-brand and pirated our XenForo plugins to use on their site instead of ponying up $10 -- maybe one day I'll have to ask them for a laptop). CloudFlare, on the other hand, at best, just passed on whatever I send in, and whoever their actual providers were never cared either, so nothing gets done. It can feel like rackeetering; sign-up for protection from the people attacking you ...whom we also protect and refuse to take down. That said, I think 99% of small sites, personal blogs, etc, really don't need any of the services offered; the most useful offering for most people is literally probably DNS. Game servers and gaming-related communities, or at the least the ones I am most attracted to, are just about the only thing I think requires DDoS mitigation regardless of size. Our little Garry's Mod TTT server with a max player limit of like ~24 people would get attacked a couple of times a week at least. And good lord, the RuneScape community is another breed of toxic. The way I learned to program was by reverse engineering the game, and we'd work on private servers that were essentially from-scratch MMORPG servers that just emulated the RuneScape mechanics and protocol. One aspect of the game, though, is PvP -- when you kill another player in the wilderness, unlike in a lot of other MMOs, you get most, if not all, of their items they have on them. I could perhaps understand DDoSing another player during combat in order to steal their gear. But what made me stunned beyond belief was that when I hosted a "spawn PKing" server (e.g., PvP-only, but you don't have to work for your gear; everything is free - it's just for fun), they'd literally lure each other into TeamSpeak to grab IP addresses and DDoS each other for.... nothing :) (and so you can imagine also just how often we'd get hit with massive attacks ourselves) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [hlandau](user?id=hlandau) [on Oct 21, 2023](item?id=37966385)   | [root](#37962674) | [parent](#37964622) | [prev](#37964747) | [next](#37965678) [–]  DDoS protection is standard among hosting providers now, including budget ones like OVH. The fact that Cloudflare is allowed to continue hosting websites which are obviously illegal, some notorious, is deeply strange. As I wrote in my article on the subject, it makes no sense when you consider the way the US responds even just to copyright infringement; see how they nuked Megaupload's business without trial because they saw them as knowingly enabling piracy. However, it's a known fact that US authorities will keep illegal or disreputable services up if they see them as a source of more intelligence. I can't really see any other explanation for how Cloudflare is allowed to host some of the sites it does without pressure from the US unless it's basically funnelling all of the data to the NSA. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [immibis](user?id=immibis) [on Oct 22, 2023](item?id=37974414)   | [root](#37962674) | [parent](#37966385) | [next](#37965678) [–]  In this aspect, Cloudflare should be viewed similarly to an ISP. Why are ISPs allowed to host illegal sites? Well, they aren't supposed to pay much attention to what they're hosting - it's not their job. But they aren't supposed to protect what they're hosting, either. If they get a court order asking for the details of the subscriber hosting some website, they turn those details over. If they get a court order asking to turn off the service, they will. Governments are fine with this, because they can easily get the details upon request. Cloudflare should be viewed the same way - they shield you from DDoS, not from the government. They allow everything to be hosted until proven otherwise. Cloudflare doesn't have to police what's hosted through it, because the police can do it easily enough. There are lots of pirate websites, explicitly designed for piracy, but saying the opposite on their terms and conditions page to create a little plausible deniability. I can't tell you if Megaupload was one of those and I don't know what evidence the government had. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [KronisLV](user?id=KronisLV) [on Oct 21, 2023](item?id=37965678)   | [root](#37962674) | [parent](#37964622) | [prev](#37966385) | [next](#37974403) [–]  > Cloudflare exists out of necessity for the most part. I agree with this, there don't seem to be that much self-hosted software that someone could (easily) setup for the use cases that Cloudflare serves. > The alternatives to shield from large scale DDoS are all US American too. Not only that, but the WAF functionality is also pretty useful. To be honest, the same applies to something like wanting to have CAPTCHAs on your own site - not that many options out there. As far as I can tell as a hobbyist, if you wanted to host everything yourself: ```   - dealing with load: at best you can probably just run multiple nodes with round robin DNS and something like HAProxy, or even just live with Nginx/Apache/Caddy, though all of those would crumble under attack; probably with some resource limits in place so the software getting overloaded just crashes it (with automatic restarts) and doesn't grind the entire server down to a halt   - WAF: you could get a basic WAF running with something like Apache2 and mod_security, or if you can compile it for Nginx and get it working (a bit annoying to do, also apparently slower than Apache2 version), or something like Coraza (still new), but even then you need sets of rules, OWASP has some, but they're not updated as often as whatever Cloudflare uses, so the effectiveness of it all is debatable; there's also something like fail2ban, but some people really don't like it for some reason   - there's also additional stuff you can use, like LibreCaptcha for CAPTCHAs, something like Keycloak or Authentik for SSO and managing your users on prem (especially with mod_auth_openidc), stuff like Matomo Analytics instead of GA, Uptime Kuma for uptime monitoring, even your own self-hosted mail servers if you feel brave; but all of those take effort and need maintenance  ``` And even then, certain things are not an option - you won't be shrugging off huge DDoS attacks and you probably won't be running your own CDN (easily), unless you have bunches of money to spend and the know-how. So of course people would rely on external orgs for whatever they can. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [immibis](user?id=immibis) [on Oct 22, 2023](item?id=37974506)   | [root](#37962674) | [parent](#37965678) | [next](#37974403) [–]  As a hobbyist, dealing with load consists of upgrading your $5 VPS to a $10 VPS or even a $50 dedicated server from Hetzner(!) - note that \*no\* other provider has dedicated servers at this price point. WAFs are heuristics at best. If what you're running on your server is actually secure, you don't need a WAF. If it's not secure, the WAF is guaranteed to let through at least one attack. CAPTCHAs are difficult. Try to avoid depending on them, but it's fair to use a third-party service if you need one. hCaptcha is pretty easy to integrate right now. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [greenreaper](user?id=greenreaper) [on Oct 24, 2023](item?id=38007198)   | [root](#37962674) | [parent](#37974506) | [next](#37976626) [–]  OVH absolutely does have dedicated servers at this price point, and below - check out their Eco range (previously SoYouStart) or even Kimsufi.

### @sledgehammer999 **[sledgehammer999](/sledgehammer999)** commented [Sep 19, 2024](#issue-2537066903)

Ignoring SSL errors was introduced ~14 years ago with commit [9824d86](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/commit/9824d86a3cbecc9fd91f0462956ca575ef742110)

I **presume** that it was a quick'n'dirty way to get SSL going which persisted to this day. It's also possible that back in the day Qt4 (?) didn't support autoloading ca root certificates from the OS's store.

IMO, there isn't a valid reason to unconditionally ignore SSL errors.

Also I am a bit hesitant in providing users an escape hatch for disabling SSL verification.

For my use cases, the log shows only two errors regarding favicon retrieval from a tracker with an expired cert and one with a cert that doesn't match the hostname.

I don't use RSS or search. So I wanna hear from the other testers what they find on their machine running this.

Sorry, something went wrong.

AFAIK this code path is also used by downloading .torrent files (for example <https://archlinux.org/releng/releases/2024.09.01/torrent/>). So it affects more than just search or rss.

ps. qbt already exposes a libtorrent setting in Advanced options: <https://www.libtorrent.org/reference-Settings.html#validate_https_trackers>

I guess user will request qbt provide a counterpart option for this one sooner or later.

What does the log look like in case of SSL error? Does it contain two messages (this and the usual message about failed request)?

Keep in mind that I merely kept the original formatting and only deleted the "Ignoring" word.

One example from my machine:

```
27/9/2024 7:18 μμ - SSL error, URL: "https://xxxxxxx.com/favicon.ico", errors: "The host name did not match any of the valid hosts for this certificate"

```

You probably didn't understand what I was talking about. I'm not talking about formatting this message. I'm asking if there is also a regular error message due to a failed request? (If you don't ignore the SSL error, it leads to a failed request, right?)

For the favico failure I don't get any additional error logged.

Should I investigate all users of downloadmanager?

OK, I've sorted it out.

Download manager does not produce a log message for each failed request, but leaves it to a specific caller. Therefore, I would not do it for case of SSL error either.

Note that the case when SSL error is ignored is different in that the request is not considered as failed, but the user is still notified of the ignored error.

| If you want reliable SSL errors you can generate them every time by setting up a proxy on a second machine in your network, routing all traffic from the machine running qBittorrent through that proxy machine before it hits the internet. Then, run [certmitm](https://github.com/aapooksman/certmitm) on the proxy machine. This tool replaces the certificates with invalid ones and will show you if the client still accepts it - it's made to test exactly this behaviour.  This is how I originally found this issue and reported via email. You will get a request to download the GeoIP db at startup, and then an update check through fosshub.com after that. |

| So basically when `ignore_ssl_error == false` -> the caller and not the download manager should decide if it wants to log a message for the SSL error. Is that what you propose? |

In case of `ignore_ssl_error == false`, you don't have to do anything at all. SSL error will be handled the same way as any other error, i.e. it will just be promoted to caller as a result of the request. |

| If we don't log the SSL error (at download manager level), then there is a chance that the caller will fail silently without logging an error. This may hinder debugging. Are we ok with that? (honest question) |

If some caller is not interested in reporting errors, then it does not do it, and it does not matter what kind of error this is. |

| What kind of debugging do you have in mind?  "Hey, my RSS feed suddenly stopped updating with the new version and I don't know why! Reverting to the previous version it works!"  Arguably it is heavy handed to handle this at the downloadmanager level. The SSL errors are a special category of failure and I don't know if we should leave it to the callers to log them. I am thinking out loud. I don't have strong feelings towards it. I can implement your proposal tomorrow probably. |

| What kind of debugging do you have in mind?  "Hey, my RSS feed suddenly stopped updating with the new version and I don't know why! Reverting to the previous version it works!"  I believe downloading failures are logged in every important cases. If some are not, then most likely they should be logged regardless of the type of error.  The SSL errors are a special category of failure and I don't know if we should leave it to the callers to log them.  In the cases where we deliberately ignore downloading errors (for example, when downloading favicons), we should hardly force log SSL errors, IMO.  I am thinking out loud. I don't have strong feelings towards it. I can implement your proposal tomorrow probably.  Let's get [@Chocobo1](https://github.com/Chocobo1) opinion. |

| SSL verification errors are the only kind of network error I can think of which sometimes mean a user is **being attacked**. Most times it's just a cert that expired and wasn't renewed on time. On occasion the wrong cert will be put in the wrong place.  But, *sometimes*, users will be under Man In The Middle attack and they should know about that. I think SSL errors should always be logged for this reason.  If logging is not done in DownloadManager, then it should definitely be done in ProgramUpdater, because currently no logging is done there and that is the most dangerous part of the application in light of this issue. SSL errors currently mean a MITM attacker can give users an arbitrary URL in the RSS data to download the update package, which users will then visit if they accept the update prompt. If I were a government trying to send a malicious binary to a target, that is what I would use.  Giving only one option to ignore all or no SSL errors is dangerous because the moment a user's favourite RSS feed throws an error, they will remove protection from the update mechanism.  Favicons seem like a less critical attack surface, until you consider how many critical RCE exploits have come from image parsing libraries in recent years. XML parsers have also had their fair share of vulnerabilities. SSL exists as much for security as it does for privacy, and it is qualitatively more important than a network resource being unavailable for whatever reason. If you have a reason to use SSL, you have a reason to care if verification fails. Just my $0.02 as a security professional. |

| The SSL errors are a special category of failure and I don't know if we should leave it to the callers to log them.  I think [@jsharp6968](https://github.com/jsharp6968) expressed better my thoughts. For what it's worth even now, on every SSL failure there is a log message (of "ignoring SSL errror: blah blah") regardless if it was "innocuous" (Favicon) or serious (update url). Users haven't complained about that (presumably the errors were very limited). So it makes more sense to continue logging centrally (from downloadmanager) every non-ignored ssl error too. |

| Can we get this backported to v4.6.x branch given its security nature? Due to v5.0 requirements for Qt, new versions are not available in Ubuntu 24.04 ([#21608 (comment)](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/issues/21608#issuecomment-2448416657)). I believe because of this, it warrants having security release for older branch. Leaving 24.04 out of support feels kinda cheap consider this is current LTS and released just few months ago. |

WP Engine now has proof it’s immune to unauthorized plugin takeover. This is a great point. By weaponizing the fact that Automatic controls the plugin registry against a rival by doing something (at best) dangerously adjacent to a supply chain attack, WP Engine stands out now as uniquely immune to that type of attack. This whole thing makes me sad, I used to use wordpress back in the 2000s and even had some plugins in the directory at the time. I was rooting for Matt but the more I read about this the more it seems like Automattic isn't the good actor here. | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [icodemuch](user?id=icodemuch) [87 days ago](item?id=41889472)   | [prev](#41889461) | [next](#41889894) [–]  This seems like a pretty damning indictment of Automattic. The WordPress foundation (that they presumably set up) may have rules that give them legal cover for some of the moves they’re making, but it’s going to hurt them in the court of public opinion. I think that matters to developers, who are the people ultimately responsible for choosing whether or not to contribute to / use their product. It’s true that migration cost might prevent churn from these actions right now but stopping the train of logic there seems short sighted. What about all the business that they may have received in the future that they might not get now because they’ve tarnished their brand? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [benatkin](user?id=benatkin) [87 days ago](item?id=41889556)   | [parent](#41889472) | [next](#41889894) [–]  I don't see it catching on that this is a "supply-chain attack" (from the article, but what came to mind when you said that it seems pretty damning). It isn't an attack because it's done deliberately by the owner (yes, owner) of the platform users are downloading from and not some upstream platform. The part of the *chain* involved is only one level deep. Maybe it's time to stop hyping up the term "software supply chain" because it gives me *You Wouldn't Download a Car* vibes. Judged on its merits and not an exaggeration, I predict that the court of public opinion is going to go the same way as the court of law – a light pushback. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [stogot](user?id=stogot) [87 days ago](item?id=41892301)   | [root](#41889472) | [parent](#41889556) | [next](#41890883) [–]  The article mentions they made subtle changes that broke websites. One user had 150 broken client sites and had to fix one by one. If that happened to me I’d consider it a supply chain attack | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [WorldWideWebb](user?id=WorldWideWebb) [87 days ago](item?id=41890883)   | [root](#41889472) | [parent](#41889556) | [prev](#41892301) | [next](#41889767) [–]  How is this not a supply chain attack? Mattomatic literally took over a plugin that WPE owns/maintains by co-opting its plugin URL/slug. They renamed the plugin but took control over the URL that everyone’s plugin points to for updates. Literal MITM attack. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [benatkin](user?id=benatkin) [87 days ago](item?id=41891015)   | [root](#41889472) | [parent](#41890883) | [next](#41889767) [–]  wordpress.org isn’t an intermediary, they’re the publisher, so they can’t be in the middle, and they can’t be MITM Now, the owner of a package could do a supply chain attack (with a very short chain which is why I think the concept is overhyped), and it would be a supply chain attack, but it wouldn’t be a man in the middle attack. WordPress took over ownership of it but they haven’t published malicious to it. Back when WP Engine owned it they could have published a malicious update and it would be a supply chain attack but with a very short chain unless the user installed a project that depended on it and caused it to automatically be installed. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [WorldWideWebb](user?id=WorldWideWebb) [87 days ago](item?id=41891045)   | [root](#41889472) | [parent](#41891015) | [next](#41932953) [–]  Wordpress.org is not the publisher of that plugin - WPE is. Wordpress.org was just hosting it in their plugin directory, which is where just about the entire community goes to for plugins. I’d guess that because of this drama, more plugin publishers will choose to not publish theirs in the directory anymore. <https://www.advancedcustomfields.com> | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [benatkin](user?id=benatkin) [87 days ago](item?id=41891126)   | [root](#41889472) | [parent](#41891045) | [next](#41932953) [–]  I’ll use npm as an example. When someone not at npm runs npm publish, their npm client sends a request for their package to be published, which to me shows that the person isn’t the publisher because they aren’t requesting for themselves to publish the package. But I see how it might be confusing. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [WorldWideWebb](user?id=WorldWideWebb) [87 days ago](item?id=41891607)   | [root](#41889472) | [parent](#41891126) | [next](#41932953) [–]  npm is a good analogy to this, but I don’t see how either one would be considered the publisher. Those are indexes/directories/whatever-you-want-to-call-it of packages/WP plugins. Another example would be something like GitHub. If GitHub (Microsoft) decided to take over the repo URL of a rival’s repository, I don’t think there would be any ambiguity about who was in the wrong. Anywho - I’m not looking to get into an argument with a random internet stranger so have a good one. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [cutemonster](user?id=cutemonster) [83 days ago](item?id=41932953)   | [root](#41889472) | [parent](#41891015) | [prev](#41891045) | [next](#41891287) [–]  Agreed that it's not a MITM but for other reasons: Automattic didn't insert themselves in between two communication nodes. Instead, they replaced one node with themselves. No further communication between the original nodes to in-the-middle intercept. Isn't it rather a flavor of Impersonation Attack? And "fraud" is maybe an ok word too? > wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain (says some dictionary) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [drchaos](user?id=drchaos) [87 days ago](item?id=41891287)   | [root](#41889472) | [parent](#41891015) | [prev](#41932953) | [next](#41889767) [–]  If npm or Ubuntu would deliberately replace a package with their own implementation, without giving you notice or making this opt-in, would you call that a supply-chain attack? I would, unless the original package contained malicious code (which is not the case with WPE's custom fields plugin) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [benatkin](user?id=benatkin) [87 days ago](item?id=41891943)   | [root](#41889472) | [parent](#41891287) | [next](#41889767) [–]  Ubuntu patches all the time. WordPress could have done exactly the same with patches! Good idea. Sometimes a patch isn’t enough so there is something like SilverWolf. That’s kinda like ACF/SCF. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [benatkin](user?id=benatkin) [87 days ago](item?id=41892469)   | [root](#41889472) | [parent](#41891943) | [next](#41889767) [–]  That's LibreWolf. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [labster](user?id=labster) [87 days ago](item?id=41889767)   | [root](#41889472) | [parent](#41889556) | [prev](#41890883) | [next](#41889894) [–]  It’s only technically a supply chain attack. Pretty much all they did was apply a security patch and remove the other company’s IP. It doesn’t really attack a user or put anyone at risk, which is what you normally mean with an attack, so it sounds hyperbolic. That said it is absolutely scummy and dumb, and a sign that Automattic puts its own whims ahead of its clients’ stability. Even if this issue gets settled tomorrow, we now know that Automattic is an irrational actor. Who is going to choose a software platform for new projects where every week a new drama unfolds? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [benatkin](user?id=benatkin) [87 days ago](item?id=41889865)   | [root](#41889472) | [parent](#41889767) | [next](#41889894) [–]  > Automattic is an irrational actor They're more human than the WP Engines of the world, though. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [labster](user?id=labster) [87 days ago](item?id=41889925)   | [root](#41889472) | [parent](#41889865) | [next](#41889894) [–]  Indeed. To err is human. No one wants to talk about what WP Engine does, because Matt is making own-goals twice a week. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [hn\_throwaway\_99](user?id=hn_throwaway_99) [87 days ago](item?id=41891637)   | [root](#41889472) | [parent](#41889925) | [next](#41889894) [–]  I'll talk about what WP Engine does, because I've been following this whole saga and I think they've done nothing wrong. Worse, I'm pissed that some open source folks are defending Matt's position that's basically "well, open source is whatever I say it is". That is, WP Engine's cardinal sin (according to their detractors) appears to be that they make a ton of money from WordPress but they don't contribute back "sufficiently" to the ecosystem. I believe (as someone who has contributed a bunch to different open source projects) that this is *complete and total bullshit*. Since when do individual open source creators get to decide "how much" other people/companies need to "give back"? There is a very good reason open source licenses explicitly specify what you can and can't do with code. If you don't like that, you shouldn't be releasing your code as open source. More to the point, even outside of WP Engine's legal obligations (which nobody is really seriously believing they are in violation of, Matt's post-hoc ridiculous claims of trademark infringement notwithstanding), I think the arguments that they were a bad actor in the community were false, too, especially given Matt's actions. Other open source creators have discovered that the economics of the cloud world means that it's easier for hosting providers to make a lot of money off open source projects than the original creators of that open source software. And while this may suck, many of these other creators handled this situation in a sane, adult manner, e.g. by forking and relicensing their software, or also see the whole nascent "fair source" movement. What they haven't done is decide to hold the whole community hostage because they decide, after the fact, that they're "owed" 8% of another company's revenue. Seriously, I'd be interested to hear any rational argument about what WP Engine did that was so objectionable. If the best they can come up with is "they don't support infinite versions as the default out of the box", you'll have to excuse me if I don't think that's some sort of cardinal sin. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [benatkin](user?id=benatkin) [87 days ago](item?id=41892162)   | [root](#41889472) | [parent](#41891637) | [next](#41889894) [–]  I see a pattern of open source leaders being judged more harshly than proprietary software leaders. I think it’s because of a feedback loop. It started before the current crop of social media. People saw they could criticize Theo de Raadt more easily than Google because Google had its own weird nerds about a decade before the phenomenon with Elon Musk. These defenders were encouraged by the money and connections of the people they were defending, which is greater than those of the open source leaders. I’m not saying you’re doing this deliberately but if you look at how long Matt Mullenweg has been leading WordPress, I think that puts the drama into context. People have forgotten a lot of the drama with FAANGs during these two decades and their leaders were never held to account. What WP Engine has done is be soulless. They got acquired by a private equity firm, which makes them like a FAANG. The ways they’ve acted are more visible to WordPress than they are to us - they undermined the way they operate with other big hosts whose datacenters communicate with their datacenters, and users with their support. Matt explains it pretty well in this video: <https://youtu.be/WU3sd1kDFLg?si=Og9QZ4_onwhbwvB3> | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [hn\_throwaway\_99](user?id=hn_throwaway_99) [87 days ago](item?id=41892562)   | [root](#41889472) | [parent](#41892162) | [next](#41895628) [–]  > I see a pattern of open source leaders being judged more harshly than proprietary software leaders. I will only speak for myself, but I find this to be baloney. I'm not judging "open source leaders" more harshly - I'm judging a *single* open source leader, Matt Mullenweg, harshly *solely* due to his own actions and statements. You say "What WP Engine has done is be soulless." That's kind of my whole point - *I don't give a fuck*, at all, that WP Engine is "soulless". First, they're a hosting company, not a church. My fundamental issue with Matt's behavior in the first place is that just because a company is "soulless", i.e. whatever line he has in his head that is the "minimum" a company should have to contribute back because they use open source software he first created, that he gets to do a shakedown, take over what was their largest open source contribution in the first place, and then demand 8% of their revenue. Frankly, I don't believe any of this moralistic framing in the first place. I think he saw WP Engine as an "unfair" competitor to WordPress.com, and his actions are simply to cripple a business competitor. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [benatkin](user?id=benatkin) [87 days ago](item?id=41892694)   | [root](#41889472) | [parent](#41892562) | [next](#41895628) [–]  > I'm not judging "open source leaders" more harshly On purpose, no. But it's a question of interest. People seem to have a lot of interest in going after open source tech leaders that they don't have for going after closed source tech leaders, partly because any time they go after closed source tech leaders they have to deal with paid defenders (many who are simply paid by being on the much larger payroll, partly funded by government contracts obtained through bribery). If you'd have judged a FAANG the same way but don't ever get around to judging them, that amounts to being more harsh with open source leaders. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [hn\_throwaway\_99](user?id=hn_throwaway_99) [87 days ago](item?id=41892810)   | [root](#41889472) | [parent](#41892694) | [next](#41933073) [–]  Whatever man. I think this is all completely irrelevant to the current WordPress saga, not to mention that I totally disagree with your 0-evidence hypothesis in the first place that people are somehow more critical of open source leaders. FWIW, there is plenty in my HN comment history lambasting Google's fall from technically-admired leader to "just another big company led by the bean counters". | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [cutemonster](user?id=cutemonster) [83 days ago](item?id=41933073)   | [root](#41889472) | [parent](#41892694) | [prev](#41892810) | [next](#41895628) [–]  > People seem to have a lot of interest in going after open source tech leaders Also, this: Often there's more OSS users (since usually it's free).

I’ve read this sentence 5 times over and still have no idea what you mean by this? How does a company being acquired by a private equity firm make them like a multinational public company? What does being “like a FAANG” mean to you? As an aside, Automattic was an investor in WP Engine and sold their shares to that same private equity firm. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [lesuorac](user?id=lesuorac) [87 days ago](item?id=41894489)   | [root](#41889472) | [parent](#41892162) | [prev](#41895628) | [next](#41897711) [–]  Eh, I'm not completely convinced open source leaders are judged more harshly. Go find people on the street and ask them to name the CEO of WordPress and then ask them to name the CEO of Google. Like the average person doesn't criticize an open source leader because they have no idea who they are. In any sort of big tech thread there are tons of criticisms about privacy violations, basic functionality, lack of support, etc. However, more to the thread. If say Amazon yoink'd Apple's store and started selling Amazon Basic Macbooks on it there would be complaints. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [CRConrad](user?id=CRConrad) [86 days ago](item?id=41897711)   | [root](#41889472) | [parent](#41892162) | [prev](#41894489) | [next](#41889894) [–]  > I’m not saying you’re doing this deliberately No, but by even mentioning that you're rather slyly implying they might be.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal\_Trade\_Commission\_v.\_Me...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission_v._Meta_Platforms%2C_Inc).

Tortious interference in a contract is normally difficult to prove because one of the elements is malice or intent to cause harm, but Matt basically handed WP Engine's lawyers all the ammo they would ever need during his yappy media tour. I would further bet that Matt's either on drugs or maybe has a brain tumor or some other undiagnosed medical condition. Only an insane person would destroy their entire reputation and life's work like this. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [TheNewsIsHere](user?id=TheNewsIsHere) [85 days ago](item?id=41910603)   | [parent](#41891783) | [next](#41889469) [–]  Alternatively, he could have been like this all along and now he’s just striking.

The community placed trust on that owner of the page to be impartial I would say yes, it is hijacking. It is very *very* similar to any MITM attack ever, like anyone in the looong chain of trust deciding that they will do something with the trust they have. Like, can your ISP redirect google.com to their own google.com? They surely can, and it probably wouldn't even break their contract with you. It would be a trademark infringement, probably GDPR violation, but not much else. Since WordPress.org *acts* as a traditional package repository, they can: serve you the package, or don't serve you the package for various reasons. Everything else is *hijacking* or *worse*, especially if the intent is just to turn you their user, and the result is to break your website. Even if you don't have a contract with them that they will serve WP Engine's unmodified plugin to you. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [yurishimo](user?id=yurishimo) [87 days ago](item?id=41890963)   | [parent](#41890945) | [prev](#41892382) | [next](#41893869) [–]  GPL.

So they instead give reasons why they insist it will be bad for his business (isn't that his business?) and pretend like that's him "technically" not doing anything tortious. It's not technical, the lawsuit from WPE is there to read. It's silly, and if it's not thrown out it will be because the judge needs time to understand the complexities of the license (and the promise that "Wordpress" will be turned over to the community *after Automattic, who has an exclusive license to the trademark, shuts down*.) Using the reasons that you think this is a bad business decision as proxy reasons why he's *wronged* everyone making a living from his work is a veiled threat. Don't threaten to leave, just leave. Maybe the problem is this haunting by the "Spirit of Open Source" where people insist that they have all of these rights that aren't in the license. Wordpress *is not open source.* It is Free Software. You already own it. Fork it if you want. If WPEngine is already doing almost as much business as Wordpress.com, they can handle everything themselves. If people love WPEngine more, they can leave. Don't whine when the value proposition for WPEngine changes after they have to take care of everything themselves, and they start violating the *Spirit of Open Source* until their bottom line looks better again. I'm swearing an oath to violate the Spirit of Open Source wherever I see a hint of it, I'm just sticking to the licenses. The Spirit of Open Source somehow makes already wealthy people feel entitled to everything in the world. Free Software is important to me, and the people who make it should be as aggressive as will financially benefit them, as long as they abide by *the letter* of the GPL. The software is what's important, not that your half-billion dollar business is built on top of somebody else's half-billion dollar business. That's a you-problem. Also, this is just straight up abuser behavior towards this guy. He doesn't do what you want with what is his, so you degrade him and accuse him of stealing his own property. It's hard to watch. I'm going to stop commenting on these threads, but this mobbing is ridiculous. I hope he's emotionally stable; but a lot of tech CEOs aren't, and his awkward reactions to the pitchforks don't give me confidence. If you're compulsively reading all of these threads, stop now.

The rest of this post is clearly very one sided and includes other falsehoods such as "The response was universally negative:" Growing tired of the article, I scroll and I see a headline "Is WP Engine the only enterprise-ready WordPress hosting provider left" are you kidding me? Disagree with the entire piece. and a return how about "Imagine Apple decided Spotify was a big enough business"... that they could easily afford to pay 30% of the proceeds they make from an app that lives in their ecosystem so that Apple can continue to develop, secure and grow - so that the app could enjoy those benefits and all can grow.. and if they didn't pay up, they get kicked out of the Apple store, I mean that would be outrageous!

Exactly. "Imagine that Apple wrote a GPL streaming music app, and Spotify was a redistributor of that app with almost no changes, but also used some of their own infrastructure to serve part of the backend of their fork. Now imagine that the reseller started doing nearly as much business as Apple with the app, but barely contributed any code. Apple asks Spotify to contribute more, Spotify replies 'lol.'

Nope, still missing it. In the G(GGG...)P's parallel, Apple didn't "kick out" *the app*, only the creator. Just like Automattic / WP.org (is there really any difference, or has that only been an illusion?) didn't "kick out" *the plug-in*, but WP Engine, *the company.* The issue they pointed out was that Automattic (via WP.org?) *hijacked the plug-in's user base.* They basically stole the plug-in from the creator -- like if Spotify on the App Store was now, as far as users are concerned, an *Apple* app. Do you finally get it now?

Many plugins have been kicked out over the years, and it's been publicly understood and discussed that given the GPL licensing, literally anyone can 'steal' a plugin and re-upload it to the wp repo.. They did not steal the user base - as anyone with the premium plugin has their email address (and their site urls) in the ACF system. In this unusual case, ACF is so embedded in so many WP things that they could not just shut it off like they have with others (still missing / miffed about wp-spamshield getting a similar treatment btw) - it needed to be replaced if removed. as a semi-tangent - I was really miffed when wp-engine took over ACF, I wish that had been disallowed somehow - it felt like a consolidation of power that could be abused, and today we see that playing out as a difficult thing. Luckily WP core has been rolling out an ACF like things in base / Gutenberg the past few months - so it's likely that adoption will continue and sadly those of us with old legacy ACF modded themes will be seen as less and less important. It's probably a good thing in the long term, it is a little messy right now though. To your point, this would not be the first time apple or google or samsung released their own thing that a developer previously had a super popular version of, and it won't be the last year such things happen. another tangent - I wish google would make a better 'missed call / text / reminder app' - not that I want the developers of the other ones kicked out, but the community could expect better than what exists. anyhow, things continue to evolve and no one has an ownership of any platform they don't own, stark reminder. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [CRConrad](user?id=CRConrad) [82 days ago](item?id=41944720)   | [root](#41890325) | [parent](#41929286) | [next](#41890381) [–]  Are you still refusing to see the obvious parallel, or have you shifted the goalposts to some totally other subject by now?

Look at all the 'todo list' apps on HN alone. regardless, they are making other ones (see gutenberg fields blocks) - but they HAD to re-make this exact one, because so many themes and plugins already use the exact code (2 million active install depend on it working) - - they also depend on it being secure, so more reason - but whatever. Anyone can rip off any gpl plugin in the repo at anytime, it's not outrageous. Automatt does not own all the directories in the world, come on. You can flourish with a 6 figure plugin or theme business and only be listed at themeforest or envato for starters. I'm not here to defend the whole kerfuckle - I think things should of gone slower from both sides, I find it reprehensible that all sides went to level 10 so quickly - but as more details come out, it appears this issues have been brewing much longer than we initially knew and got surprised by. It is not defending the indefensible - it makes sense, and its' not worse than what apple did to fortnite and so many others, its no different that what happened with wpmudev back in the day - so many others.. Truth is the owners of acf/engine were riding high making lots of money while using WP resources, they got asked to pony up some resources, they refused. They got blocked from the free resources they depended on (and so many of their subscribers depended on) The nice thing is WP and co have made a full copy of all the things available to them to host on their own servers and the GPL allows them to fork and make their wordpress sites pull from their own directory. Wpengine has taken a very adverserial stance that may save it some money this year, but may cost them more in the years to come. Wordpress has also suffered some reputational damage, but it's more of a wakeup call that you should not live by someone else's code or directory and these issues are possible. These sorts of things have happened many times in the past in smaller ways, like wordpress changing code that breaks premium themes like Salient - well we all spend resources to adapt or we don't spend resources and keep things using the old version of WP for example. Hey if it's your plugin I agree it sucks, but hey you made (they bought) a plugin that is GPL, sharecropping on someone else's code base and directory.

## [§](#rustls---a-modern-tls-library)Rustls - a modern TLS library

Rustls is a TLS library that aims to provide a good level of cryptographic security,
requires no configuration to achieve that security, and provides no unsafe features or
obsolete cryptography by default.

Rustls implements TLS1.2 and TLS1.3 for both clients and servers. See [the full
list of protocol features](manual/_04_features/index.html "mod rustls::manual::_04_features").

#### [§](#platform-support)Platform support

While Rustls itself is platform independent, by default it uses [`aws-lc-rs`](https://crates.io/crates/aws-lc-rs) for implementing
the cryptography in TLS. See [the aws-lc-rs FAQ](https://aws.github.io/aws-lc-rs/faq.html#can-i-run-aws-lc-rs-on-x-platform-or-architecture) for more details of the
platform/architecture support constraints in aws-lc-rs.

[`ring`](https://crates.io/crates/ring) is also available via the `ring` crate feature: see
[the supported `ring` target platforms](https://github.com/briansmith/ring/blob/2e8363b433fa3b3962c877d9ed2e9145612f3160/include/ring-core/target.h#L18-L64).

By providing a custom instance of the [`crypto::CryptoProvider`](crypto/struct.CryptoProvider.html "struct rustls::crypto::CryptoProvider") struct, you
can replace all cryptography dependencies of rustls. This is a route to being portable
to a wider set of architectures and environments, or compliance requirements. See the
[`crypto::CryptoProvider`](crypto/struct.CryptoProvider.html "struct rustls::crypto::CryptoProvider") documentation for more details.

Specifying `default-features = false` when depending on rustls will remove the
dependency on aws-lc-rs.

Rustls requires Rust 1.63 or later. It has an optional dependency on zlib-rs which requires 1.75 or later.

#### [§](#cryptography-providers)Cryptography providers

Since Rustls 0.22 it has been possible to choose the provider of the cryptographic primitives
that Rustls uses. This may be appealing if you have specific platform, compliance or feature
requirements that aren’t met by the default provider, [`aws-lc-rs`](https://crates.io/crates/aws-lc-rs).

Users that wish to customize the provider in use can do so when constructing `ClientConfig`
and `ServerConfig` instances using the `with_crypto_provider` method on the respective config
builder types. See the [`crypto::CryptoProvider`](crypto/struct.CryptoProvider.html "struct rustls::crypto::CryptoProvider") documentation for more details.

##### [§](#built-in-providers)Built-in providers

Rustls ships with two built-in providers controlled with associated feature flags:

* [`aws-lc-rs`](https://crates.io/crates/aws-lc-rs) - enabled by default, available with the `aws_lc_rs` feature flag enabled.
* [`ring`](https://crates.io/crates/ring) - available with the `ring` feature flag enabled.

See the documentation for [`crypto::CryptoProvider`](crypto/struct.CryptoProvider.html "struct rustls::crypto::CryptoProvider") for details on how providers are
selected.

##### [§](#third-party-providers)Third-party providers

The community has also started developing third-party providers for Rustls:

* [`rustls-mbedtls-provider`](https://github.com/fortanix/rustls-mbedtls-provider) - a provider that uses [`mbedtls`](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls) for cryptography.
* [`rustls-openssl`](https://github.com/tofay/rustls-openssl) - a provider that uses [OpenSSL](https://openssl-library.org/) for cryptography.
* [`rustls-post-quantum`](https://crates.io/crates/rustls-post-quantum): an experimental provider that adds support for post-quantum
  key exchange to the default aws-lc-rs provider.
* [`boring-rustls-provider`](https://github.com/janrueth/boring-rustls-provider) - a work-in-progress provider that uses [`boringssl`](https://github.com/google/boringssl) for
  cryptography.
* [`rustls-rustcrypto`](https://github.com/RustCrypto/rustls-rustcrypto) - an experimental provider that uses the crypto primitives
  from [`RustCrypto`](https://github.com/RustCrypto) for cryptography.
* [`rustls-symcrypt`](https://github.com/microsoft/rustls-symcrypt) - a provider that uses Microsoft’s [SymCrypt](https://github.com/microsoft/SymCrypt) library.
* [`rustls-wolfcrypt-provider`](https://github.com/wolfSSL/rustls-wolfcrypt-provider) - a work-in-progress provider that uses [`wolfCrypt`](https://www.wolfssl.com/products/wolfcrypt) for cryptography.

##### [§](#custom-provider)Custom provider

We also provide a simple example of writing your own provider in the [`custom-provider`](https://github.com/rustls/rustls/tree/main/provider-example/)
example. This example implements a minimal provider using parts of the [`RustCrypto`](https://github.com/RustCrypto)
ecosystem.

See the [Making a custom CryptoProvider](https://docs.rs/rustls/latest/rustls/crypto/struct.CryptoProvider.html#making-a-custom-cryptoprovider) section of the documentation for more information
on this topic.

### [§](#design-overview)Design overview

Rustls is a low-level library. If your goal is to make HTTPS connections you may prefer
to use a library built on top of Rustls like [hyper](https://crates.io/crates/hyper) or [ureq](https://crates.io/crates/ureq).

#### [§](#rustls-does-not-take-care-of-network-io)Rustls does not take care of network IO

It doesn’t make or accept TCP connections, or do DNS, or read or write files.

Our [examples](https://github.com/rustls/rustls/tree/main/examples) directory contains demos that show how to handle I/O using the
[`stream::Stream`](struct.Stream.html "struct rustls::Stream") helper, as well as more complex asynchronous I/O using [`mio`](https://docs.rs/mio/latest/mio/).
If you’re already using Tokio for an async runtime you may prefer to use [`tokio-rustls`](https://github.com/rustls/tokio-rustls) instead
of interacting with rustls directly.

#### [§](#rustls-provides-encrypted-pipes)Rustls provides encrypted pipes

These are the [`ServerConnection`](server/struct.ServerConnection.html "struct rustls::server::ServerConnection") and [`ClientConnection`](client/struct.ClientConnection.html "struct rustls::client::ClientConnection") types. You supply raw TLS traffic
on the left (via the [`read_tls()`](enum.Connection.html#method.read_tls "method rustls::Connection::read_tls") and [`write_tls()`](enum.Connection.html#method.read_tls "method rustls::Connection::read_tls") methods) and then read/write the
plaintext on the right:

```
         TLS                                   Plaintext
         ===                                   =========
    read_tls()      +-----------------------+      reader() as io::Read
                    |                       |
          +--------->   ClientConnection    +--------->
                    |          or           |
          <---------+   ServerConnection    <---------+
                    |                       |
    write_tls()     +-----------------------+      writer() as io::Write
```
#### [§](#rustls-takes-care-of-server-certificate-verification)Rustls takes care of server certificate verification

You do not need to provide anything other than a set of root certificates to trust.
Certificate verification cannot be turned off or disabled in the main API.

### [§](#getting-started)Getting started

This is the minimum you need to do to make a TLS client connection.

First we load some root certificates. These are used to authenticate the server.
The simplest way is to depend on the [`webpki_roots`](https://crates.io/crates/webpki-roots) crate which contains
the Mozilla set of root certificates.

```
let root_store = rustls::RootCertStore::from_iter(
    webpki_roots::TLS_SERVER_ROOTS
        .iter()
        .cloned(),
);
```

Next, we make a `ClientConfig`. You’re likely to make one of these per process,
and use it for all connections made by that process.

```
let config = rustls::ClientConfig::builder()
    .with_root_certificates(root_store)
    .with_no_client_auth();
```

Now we can make a connection. You need to provide the server’s hostname so we
know what to expect to find in the server’s certificate.

```
let rc_config = Arc::new(config);
let example_com = "example.com".try_into().unwrap();
let mut client = rustls::ClientConnection::new(rc_config, example_com);
```

Now you should do appropriate IO for the `client` object. If `client.wants_read()` yields
true, you should call `client.read_tls()` when the underlying connection has data.
Likewise, if `client.wants_write()` yields true, you should call `client.write_tls()`
when the underlying connection is able to send data. You should continue doing this
as long as the connection is valid.

The return types of `read_tls()` and `write_tls()` only tell you if the IO worked. No
parsing or processing of the TLS messages is done. After each `read_tls()` you should
therefore call `client.process_new_packets()` which parses and processes the messages.
Any error returned from `process_new_packets` is fatal to the connection, and will tell you
why. For example, if the server’s certificate is expired `process_new_packets` will
return `Err(InvalidCertificate(Expired))`. From this point on,
`process_new_packets` will not do any new work and will return that error continually.

You can extract newly received data by calling `client.reader()` (which implements the
`io::Read` trait). You can send data to the peer by calling `client.writer()` (which
implements `io::Write` trait). Note that `client.writer().write()` buffers data you
send if the TLS connection is not yet established: this is useful for writing (say) a
HTTP request, but this is buffered so avoid large amounts of data.

The following code uses a fictional socket IO API for illustration, and does not handle
errors.

```
use std::io;
use rustls::Connection;

client.writer().write(b"GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n").unwrap();
let mut socket = connect("example.com", 443);
loop {
  if client.wants_read() && socket.ready_for_read() {
    client.read_tls(&mut socket).unwrap();
    client.process_new_packets().unwrap();

    let mut plaintext = Vec::new();
    client.reader().read_to_end(&mut plaintext).unwrap();
    io::stdout().write(&plaintext).unwrap();
  }

  if client.wants_write() && socket.ready_for_write() {
    client.write_tls(&mut socket).unwrap();
  }

  socket.wait_for_something_to_happen();
}
```
## [§](#examples)Examples

You can find several client and server examples of varying complexity in the [examples](https://github.com/rustls/rustls/tree/main/examples)
directory, including [`tlsserver-mio`](https://github.com/rustls/rustls/blob/main/examples/src/bin/tlsserver-mio.rs)
and [`tlsclient-mio`](https://github.com/rustls/rustls/blob/main/examples/src/bin/tlsclient-mio.rs)
- full worked examples using [`mio`](https://docs.rs/mio/latest/mio/).

## [§](#crate-features)Crate features

Here’s a list of what features are exposed by the rustls crate and what
they mean.

* `aws_lc_rs` (enabled by default): makes the rustls crate depend on the [`aws-lc-rs`](https://crates.io/crates/aws-lc-rs) crate.
  Use `rustls::crypto::aws_lc_rs::default_provider().install_default()` to
  use it as the default `CryptoProvider`, or provide it explicitly
  when making a `ClientConfig` or `ServerConfig`.

  Note that aws-lc-rs has additional build-time dependencies like cmake.
  See [the documentation](https://aws.github.io/aws-lc-rs/requirements/index.html) for details.
* `ring`: makes the rustls crate depend on the *ring* crate for cryptography.
  Use `rustls::crypto::ring::default_provider().install_default()` to
  use it as the default `CryptoProvider`, or provide it explicitly
  when making a `ClientConfig` or `ServerConfig`.
* `fips`: enable support for FIPS140-3-approved cryptography, via the aws-lc-rs crate.
  This feature enables the `aws_lc_rs` feature, which makes the rustls crate depend
  on [aws-lc-rs](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc-rs). It also changes the default
  for [`ServerConfig::require_ems`](server/struct.ServerConfig.html#structfield.require_ems "field rustls::server::ServerConfig::require_ems") and [`ClientConfig::require_ems`](client/struct.ClientConfig.html#structfield.require_ems "field rustls::client::ClientConfig::require_ems").

  See [manual::\_06\_fips](manual/_06_fips/index.html "mod rustls::manual::_06_fips") for more details.
* `custom-provider`: disables implicit use of built-in providers (`aws-lc-rs` or `ring`). This forces
  applications to manually install one, for instance, when using a custom `CryptoProvider`.
* `tls12` (enabled by default): enable support for TLS version 1.2. Note that, due to the
  additive nature of Cargo features and because it is enabled by default, other crates
  in your dependency graph could re-enable it for your application. If you want to disable
  TLS 1.2 for security reasons, consider explicitly enabling TLS 1.3 only in the config
  builder API.
* `logging` (enabled by default): make the rustls crate depend on the `log` crate.
  rustls outputs interesting protocol-level messages at `trace!` and `debug!` level,
  and protocol-level errors at `warn!` and `error!` level. The log messages do not
  contain secret key data, and so are safe to archive without affecting session security.
* `read_buf`: when building with Rust Nightly, adds support for the unstable
  `std::io::ReadBuf` and related APIs. This reduces costs from initializing
  buffers. Will do nothing on non-Nightly releases.
* `brotli`: uses the `brotli` crate for RFC8879 certificate compression support.
* `zlib`: uses the `zlib-rs` crate for RFC8879 certificate compression support.

EDIT: The author of the PR[0] (who is one of the top qBittorrent contributors according to GitHub[1]) that fixed this also came to this conclusion: > I presume that it was a quick'n'dirty way to get SSL going which persisted to this day. It's also possible that back in the day Qt4 (?) didn't support autoloading ca root certificates from the OS's store. [0]: <https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/pull/21364> [1]: [https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/graphs/contributo...](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/graphs/contributors) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [0xsee4](user?id=0xsee4) [74 days ago](item?id=42023588)   | [root](#42015868) | [parent](#42022770) | [next](#42023857) [–]  To be fair, this function ignoreSslErrors is not from the authors of qBittorrent, it comes from QT framework. The idea behind the function is that you provide it a small whitelist of errors you wish to ignore, for example in a Dev build you may well want to ignore self-signed errors for your Dev environment. The trouble is, you can call it with no arguments and this means you will ignore every error. This may have been misunderstood by the qBittorrent maintainers, maybe not. Much more likely is that someone knew they had implemented this temporary solution while they implemented OpenSSL in a project which previously never had SSL support - a major change with a lot of work involved - and every programmer knows that there is nothing more permanent than a temporary solution. Especially in this case. I can understand how such code would make it into the repo(I think you do too), and it's very easy for us to say we would then have immediately amended it in the next version to properly verify certs. Having been in contact with the maintainers, I have to say I was disappointed in how seriously they took the issue. I don't want to say any more than that.

Years ago, in one of our projects, someone wrote a small helper class, HTTPClient, to talk to one of our internal subsystems. The subsystem in the dev environment used self-signed certificates, so one of the devs just disabled SSL validation. Whether SSL errors were ignored or not was specified in a config. Later, someone messed up while editing the configs, and SSL validation got disabled in the live environment, too. No one noticed, because nobody writes tests to check if SSL validation is enabled. But that's only part of the story, this HTTPClient class was still only used to communicate with our internal subsystem on our own network. The real problem came later when the next generation of developers saw this HTTPClient class and thought, "Hey, what a nifty little helper!", and soon they were using it to talk to pretty much everything, including financial systems. I was shocked when I discovered it. An inconsequential temporary workaround had turned into a huge security hole. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [xelamonster](user?id=xelamonster) [73 days ago](item?id=42027762)   | [root](#42015868) | [parent](#42023588) | [prev](#42024665) | [next](#42029099) [–]  This is interesting, I haven't ever used the Qt framework but I'm surprised that it would even have an SSL implementation, sounds a bit out of scope for a GUI toolkit. I think I'd prefer to do all my networking separately and provide the fetched data to Qt. Edit (just noticed this was the author): I'm curious what torrent client do you prefer?

I waited for a patched version to be released, because the next important milestone after that would be finished backports to older versions still in use, which is clearly going to take a long time as it is not being prioritized, so I wanted to inform users. Initially I had said 90 days from the initial report, but it seemed like they were expanding the work to fill that time. I asked a number of times for them to make a security advisory and got no answer. Some discussions on the repo showed they were considering this as a *theoretical* issue. Now it's CVE-2024-51774, which got assigned within 48 hours of disclosing. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [perching\_aix](user?id=perching_aix) [73 days ago](item?id=42025568)   | [root](#42015868) | [parent](#42025322) | [next](#42026384) [–]  > Some discussions on the repo showed they were considering this as a theoretical issue.

I will disclose it on Monday. No hard feelings.” With ridiculous 45-90 day windows it’s the users that take on most all the risk, and in many ways that’s just as if not more unethical than some script kids catching wind before a patch is out. Every deployment of software is different and downstream consumers should be able to make an immediate call as to how to handle vulns that pop up. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [MikeHolman](user?id=MikeHolman) [73 days ago](item?id=42027258)   | [root](#42015868) | [parent](#42026384) | [next](#42029287) [–]  Strongly disagree. 45 days to allow the authors to fix a bug that has been present for over a decade is not really much added risk for users. In this case, 45 days is about 1% additional time for the bug to be around. Maybe someone was exploiting it, but this extra time risk is a drop in the bucket, whereas releasing the bug immediately puts all users at high risk until a patch can be developed/released, and users update their software. Maybe immediate disclosure would cause a few users to change their behavior, but no one is tracking security disclosures on all the software they use and changing their behavior based on them. The caveat here is in case you have evidence of active exploitation, then immediate disclosure makes sense. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [rustcleaner](user?id=rustcleaner) [73 days ago](item?id=42029287)   | [root](#42015868) | [parent](#42026384) | [prev](#42027258) | [next](#42023902) [–]  What if we changed the fundamental equation of the game: no more "responsible" disclosures, or define responsible as immediate and as widely published as possible (ideally with PoC). If anything, embargoes and timelines are irresponsible as they create unacceptable information asymmetry. An embargo is also an opportunity to back-room sell the facts of the embargo to the NSA or other national security apparatus on the downlow. An embargoed vulnerability will likely have a premium valuation model following something which rhymes with Black Scholes. Really, really think about it... | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [metadat](user?id=metadat) [74 days ago](item?id=42023902)   | [root](#42015868) | [parent](#42023644) | [prev](#42025322) | [next](#42023857) [–]  Warning shots across the bow in private are the polite and responsible way, but malicious actors don't typically extend such courtesies to their victims. As such, compared to the alternative (bad actors having even more time to leverage and amplify the information asymmetry), a timely public disclosure is preferable, even with some unfortunate and unavoidable fallout. Typically security researchers are reasonable and want to do *the right thing* with regard to responsible disclosure. On average, the "bigger party" inherently has more resources to respond compared to the reporter. This remains true even in open source software. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tsimionescu](user?id=tsimionescu) [74 days ago](item?id=42024866)   | [root](#42015868) | [parent](#42023902) | [next](#42026407) [–]  This is a pretty dangerous take. The reality is that the vast majority of security vulnerabilities in software are not actively exploited, beause no one knows about them. Unless you have proof of active exploitation, you are *much* more likely to hurt users by publicly disclosing a 0-day than by responsibly disclosing it to the developer and giving them a reasonable amount of time to come out with a patch. Even if the developers are acting badly. Making a vulnerability public is putting a target on every *user*, not on the developer. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [wisemang](user?id=wisemang) [73 days ago](item?id=42025940)   | [root](#42015868) | [parent](#42024866) | [next](#42026606) [–]  Your take is the dangerous one. I don’t disagree that > the vast majority of security vulnerabilities in software are not actively exploited However I’d say your explanation that it’s > because no one knows about them is not necessarily the reason why. If the vendor or developer isn’t fixing things, going public is the correct option. (I agree some lead time / attempt at coordinated disclosure is preferable here.) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tsimionescu](user?id=tsimionescu) [73 days ago](item?id=42031725)   | [root](#42015868) | [parent](#42025940) | [next](#42026606) [–]  > (I agree some lead time / attempt at coordinated disclosure is preferable here.) Then I think we are in agreement overall. I took your initial comment to mean that as soon as you discover a vulnerability, you should make it public. If we agree that the process should always be to disclose it to the project, wait some amount of time, and only then make it public - then I think we are actually on the exact same page. Now, for the specific amount of time: ideally, you'd wait until the project has a patch available, if they are collaborating and prioritizing things appropriately. However, if they are dragging their feet and/or not even acknowledging that a fix is needed, then I also agree that you should set a fixed time as a last ditch attempt to get them to fix it (say, "2 weeks from today"), and then make it public as a 0-day. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [wisemang](user?id=wisemang) [68 days ago](item?id=42082248)   | [root](#42015868) | [parent](#42031725) | [next](#42026606) [–]  Indeed, we’re in agreement. Though I’d suggest a fixed disclosure timeframe at time of reporting. Maybe with an option to extend in cases where the fix is more complex than anticipated. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [dgfitz](user?id=dgfitz) [73 days ago](item?id=42026606)   | [root](#42015868) | [parent](#42024866) | [prev](#42025940) | [next](#42026407) [–]  > Unless you have proof of active exploitation Wouldn’t a “good criminal” just exploit it forever without getting caught?

However, if you don't know that it is being actively exploited, then the right course of action is to disclose it secretly to the creators, and work with them to coordinate on a timely patch before any public disclosure. Exactly how timely will depend on yours and their judgement of many factors. Even if the team is showing very bad judgement from your point of view, and acting dismissively; even if you have a history with them of doing this - you still owe it to the users of the code to at least try, and to at least give some unilateral but reasonable timeline in which you will disclose. Even if you don't want to do this free work, the alternative is not to publicly disclose: it's to do nothing.

The culture of code reviewing PR's from 14 years ago is a little different from today and is also why any "quick hacks to make things work" should always have some form of "//HACK: REVIEW OR REMOVE BY <DATE>" attached to it to make it easy to find. From a security perspective there are only two kinds of code bases: open & closed. By deduction one of those will have more eyeballs on the codebase than the other even if "nobody looks". Case in point: It may have taken 14 years but someone looked. Had the code base been closed source that may never have happened because it might not have been possible to ever happen. It's also very easy to point to the number of security issues that never made it into production because it was caught in an open source code review by passerbys and other contributors while the PR was waiting to be merged. The fact it was caught at all is a point *for* open source security - not *against* it.

I'd think that there are only following two kinds of code bases: those that come with no warranty or guarantee whatsoever, and those attached to a contract (actual or implied) that gives users legal recourse specific party in case of damages caused by issues with that code (security or otherwise). Guess which kind of code, proprietary or FLOSS, tends to come with legal guarantees attached? Hint: it's usually the one you pay for.

I want to agree with you and agree with your reasoning (which is why I upvoted you as I think it is a good argument) but cannot think of any example where this has been the case. Perhaps in medical/aviation/government niches but not in any niche I've worked in or can find an example of. The publicly known lawsuits seem to come from data breeches and the large majority of those data breeches are due to non-code lapses in security. Leaked credentials, phished employee, social engineering, setting something Public that should be Internal-only, etc. In fact, in many proprietary products they rely on FLOSS code which resulted in an exploit and the company owning the product may be sued for the resulting data breeches as a result. But that's an issue with their product contract and their use of FLOSS code without code review. As it turns out many proprietary products aren't code reviewing the FLOSS projects they rely on either despite their supposed potential legal liability to do so. > I say that because it's how safety and security work everywhere else - they're created and guaranteed through legal liability. I don't think the legal enforcement or guarantees are anywhere near as strong as other fields, such as say... actual engineering or the medical field. If a doctor fucks up badly enough they can no longer practice medicine. If a SWE fucks up bad enough they *might* get fired? But they can certainly keep producing new code and may find a job elsewhere if they are let go. Software isn't a licensed field and so is missing a lot of safety and security checks that licensed fields have. Reheating already cooked food to sell to the public requires a food handler's card which is already a higher bar than exists in the world of software development.

Quick web search tells me there's a bunch of lawsuits in flight, some aimed at Crowdstrike itself, others just between parties caught in the fallout. Hell, Delta Airlines and Crowdstrike are apparently suing each other over the whole mess. > *The publicly known lawsuits seem to come from data breeches and the large majority of those data breeches are due to non-code lapses in security.* Data breaches don't matter IMO; there rarely if ever is any obvious, real damage to the victims, so unless the stock price is at risk, or data protection authorities in some EU countries start making noises, nobody cares. But the bit about "non-code lapses", that's an important point. For many reasons, software really sucks at being a product, so as much as possible, it's seen and trades as a service. "Code lapses" and "non-code lapses" are not the units of interest. The vendor you license some SDK from isn't going to promise you the code is flawless - but they do promise you a certain level of support, responsiveness, or service availability, and are incentivized to fulfill it if they want to keep the money flowing. When I mentioned lawsuits, that was a bit of a shorthand for an illustration. Of course you don't see that many of them happening - lawsuits in the business world are like military actions in international politics; all cooperation ultimately is backed by *threat* of force, but if that threat has to actually be made good on, it means everyone in the room screwed up real bad. 99% of the time, things get talked out without much noise. Angry e-mails are exchanged, lawyers get CC-d, people get put on planes and send to do some emergency fixing, contractual penalties are brought up. Everyone has an incentive in getting themselves out of trouble, which may or may not involve fixing things, but at least it involves some predictable outcomes. It's not perfect, but nothing is. > *I don't think the legal enforcement or guarantees are anywhere near as strong as other fields, such as say... actual engineering or the medical field.

Software isn't a licensed field and so is missing a lot of safety and security checks that licensed fields have.* Fair. But then, SWEs aren't usually doing blowtorch surgery on live gas lines. They're usually a part of an organization, which means processes are involved (or the org isn't going to be on the market very long (unless they're a critical defense contractor)). On the other hand, let's be honest: > *Cybersecurity isn't taken all that serious by seemingly anyone.* Cybersecurity isn't taken all that serious by seemingly anyone, *because it mostly isn't a big problem*. For most companies, the only real threat is a dip in the stock price, and that's if they're trading. Your random web SaaS isn't really doing anything important, so their cybersecurity lapses don't do any meaningful damage to anyone either. For better or worse, what the system understands is money. Blowing up a gas pipe, or poisoning some people, or wiping some retirement accounts, translates to a lot of $$$. Having your e-mail account pop up on HIBP translates to approximately $0. The point I'm trying to make is, in the proprietary world, software is an artifact of a mesh of companies, bound together by contracts. Down the link flows software, up the link flows liability. In between there's a lot of people whose main concern is to keep their jobs. It's not perfect, and corporate world is *really good* at shifting liability around, but it's doing the job. In this world, FLOSS is a terminating node. FLOSS authors have no actual skin in the game - they're releasing their code for free and disclaiming responsibility. So while "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow", most of those eyes belong to volunteers. FLOSS security relies on good will and care of individuals. Proprietary security relies on individual self-preservation - but you have to be in a position to threaten the provider to benefit from it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [perching\_aix](user?id=perching_aix) [73 days ago](item?id=42025529)   | [root](#42015868) | [parent](#42023901) | [prev](#42024438) | [next](#42027985) [–]  > As opposed to the “security” of closed source software?

My comment was about Python.org and I think that it wouldn't be unusual for a student to start doing some work in a coffee shop and get MITMd.

Me getting some software only means I trust the party I got it from *at that moment of time, for that particular version of the software*. It doesn't imply I trust that party indefinitely. This is the reason why so many people hate automatic updates (and often disable them when possible): *they don't trust the vendor* beyond the point of initial installation. They don't trust the vendor won't screw them up with UX "improvements" or license changes or countless other things that actively make users' life miserable. Think about Windows and Microsoft. You can't at the same time say you don't trust them because of their track record of screwing with their users and enshittifying their products, and at the same time, say they're a trusted first party in your Windows installation. They aren't - they can and will screw you over with some update. In this sense, it's not a stretch to compare unattended updates with RCE vulnerabiltiy. Just because the attacker is the product vendor, doesn't mean they're not going to pwn your machine and make you miserable. And just because their actions are legal, doesn't make them less painful. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [dist-epoch](user?id=dist-epoch) [73 days ago](item?id=42025416)   | [parent](#42024127) | [prev](#42024448) | [next](#42024365) [–]  Clicking "Yes" on a "Do you want to upgrade to the latest version?" is not fundamentally different. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bmacho](user?id=bmacho) [74 days ago](item?id=42024365)   | [parent](#42024127) | [prev](#42025416) | [next](#42027355) [–]  > Automatic unattended autoupdate is logically indistinguishable from a RAT/trojan.

Malicious Executable loader with stealth functionality TL;DR the client downloads Python from python.org over HTTPS. This isn't *great* (especially since it's hard-coded to 3.12.4), but there's no obvious exploit path which doesn't involve both MITM and user interaction. > 2. Browser Hijacking + Executable Download (Software Upgrade Context) TL;DR the client downloads an RSS file over HTTPS and will conditionally prompt the user to open a URL found in that file. This is even lower risk than #1; even if you can MITM the user and get them to click "update", all you get to do with that is show the user a web page. > 3. RSS Feeds (Arbitrary URL injection) The researcher seems confused by the expected behavior of an RSS client. > 4. Decompression library attack surface (0-click) If you can find an exploit in zlib, there are much worse things you can do with that than attacking a torrent client.

Since the original issue is that the ssl errors are ignored, then all those https downloads are downgraded to http downloads in practice (no need to mitm to attack).

You basically have two options to do it "correctly": 1) Walk a path of broken glass and razorblades, on your naked knees, through the depths of hell, trying to get a complex set of ancient tools and policies that no one truly understands to work together. One misstep, the whole thing seizes up, and good luck debugging or fixing it across organizational boundaries. 2) Throw in the towel and expose the insides of your org, and everyone you come into contact with, on the public Internet, so you can leverage "Internet-standard" tools and practices. One of the fundamental issues is that doing SSL properly breaks a basic engineering assumption of locality/isolation. That is, if I'm making a tool that talks to another tool (that may or may not be made by me too) directly, I should only care about the two tools and the link between them. *Not the goddamn public Internet*. Alas, setting SSL means either entangling your tool with the corporate universe, or replicating a facsimile of the entire world locally, just so nothing in the stack starts whining about CAs, or that self-signed certs smell like poop, or something. Like seriously. You make a dumb internal tool for yourself, with a web interface. You figure you want to do HTTPS because browsers whine (o. Apparently the correct way of doing this is... to buy a domain and get a cert from LetsEncrypt. WTF. The whole philosophy around certificates is *not* designed to facilitate development. And guess what, I too sometimes get requests to give ability for a tool to skip some checks to make product testing possible, and it turns out that the whole communication stack already has flags for exactly that, for exactly that reason. EDIT: Imagine an arm broke off your coat hanger. You figure you'll take a metal bracket and two screws and fix it right there. But as you try, your power drill refuses to work and flashes some error about "insecure environment". You go on-line, and everyone tells you you need to go to the city council and register the drill and the coat hanger on a free Let's Construct build permit. This is how dealing with SSL "correctly" feels. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [arccy](user?id=arccy) [73 days ago](item?id=42025457)   | [root](#42023276) | [parent](#42025100) | [next](#42025610) [–]  the network is never secure, that's why there's all this stuff going on about "zero trust" | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [TeMPOraL](user?id=TeMPOraL) [73 days ago](item?id=42026255)   | [root](#42023276) | [parent](#42025457) | [next](#42025580) [–]  Nothing in life is ever secure. "All this stuff going on about ''zero trust''" is a broad and diverse mix of good practices, hot air, fear, misconceptions about reality, and power seeking. I'd dare say that in a big way, it's practical effects are, intentionally or otherwise, disenfranchising workers, screwing with their ability to do their jobs, generating huge costs and threat exposure across the board. But it's sure nice if you're a supplier in the "zero trust" market. Also, not everything is - or should be - on the Internet; there exists more than one network. Different systems have different needs and risk profiles. Failing to recognize that fact, and trying to apply the same most strict security standards to everything doesn't lead to more security - it leads to people caring less, and getting creative with workarounds. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ninkendo](user?id=ninkendo) [73 days ago](item?id=42025580)   | [root](#42023276) | [parent](#42025457) | [prev](#42026255) | [next](#42025610) [–]  Please explain to me about how the “network” between my browser and my kubernetes dev installation on the same computer is insecure. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [im3w1l](user?id=im3w1l) [73 days ago](item?id=42025610)   | [root](#42023276) | [parent](#42025100) | [prev](#42025457) | [next](#42025540) [–]  Regarding your example, it really does seem like the direction the world is moving. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [TeMPOraL](user?id=TeMPOraL) [73 days ago](item?id=42029054)   | [root](#42023276) | [parent](#42025610) | [next](#42025540) [–]  It's not a coincidence.

## Description

Good day.

I fail to using deluge 1.3.5 in proxy environment (w/o autorization). It worked fine in 1.3.4 at the same site and I'm 100% that I didn't block anything in squid proxy server, all the applications like IM-clients, browsers etc successfully working via the same proxy. Here is how I tested it:

* removed ~/.config/deluge

Then just start it, go to Edit -> Preferences -> Proxy. Put in HTTP, proxyaddr:proxyport into all four fields and then just checking squid with sqstat - there is not even connections from deluge.

I also did another test: the settings are the same (proxy is turned on in deluge), and on default router's firewall I allowed direct connections with internets from my system - deluge successfully downloading the same torrent, but still not using proxy. So it looks like that it didn't ever try to use it.

If it make any difference, I'm using GTK-frontend of deluge 1.3.5 on FreeBSD. Related apps versions are:

boost-libs-1.48.0
boost-python-libs-1.48.0
libtorrent-rasterbar-0.16.2
py-libtorrent-rasterbar-0.16.2 (python binding)
python 2.7.3

Please note once again that deluge working just fine another way. The problem is only appears when I try to use deluge via proxy. And there was no such problems with 1.3.4 in the same environment.

Here is what was added to my ~/.config/deluge/core.conf

```
  "proxies": {
    "peer": {
      "username": "",
      "password": "",
      "type": 4,
      "port": 3128,
      "hostname": "192.168.0.7"
    },
    "web_seed": {
      "username": "",
      "password": "",
      "type": 4,
      "port": 3128,
      "hostname": "192.168.0.7"
    },
    "tracker": {
      "username": "",
      "password": "",
      "type": 4,
      "port": 3128,
      "hostname": "192.168.0.7"
    },
    "dht": {
      "username": "",
      "password": "",
      "type": 4,
      "port": 3128,
      "hostname": "192.168.0.7"
    }
  },

```

I see in debug log:

```
[DEBUG   ] 15:27:06 config:197 Setting 'proxies' to {'peer': {'username': '', 'password': '', 'hostname': '', 'type': 0, 'port': 8080}, 'web_seed': {'username': '', 'password': '', 'hostname': '', 'type': 0, 'port': 8080}, 'tracker': {'username': '', 'password': '', 'hostname': '', 'type': 0, 'port': 8080}, 'dht': {'username': '', 'password': '', 'hostname': '', 'type': 0, 'port': 8080}} of <type 'dict'>

```

and later:

```
[DEBUG   ] 15:27:06 config:391 Config /home/rm/.config/deluge/core.conf version: 1.1 loaded: {'proxies': {u'peer': {u'username': u'', u'password': u'', u'type': 4, u'port': 3128, u'hostname': u'192.168.0.7'}, u'web_seed': {u'username': u'', u'password': u'', u'type': 4, u'port': 3128, u'hostname': u'192.168.0.7'}, u'tracker': {u'username': u'', u'password': u'', u'type': 4, u'port': 3128, u'hostname': u'192.168.0.7'}, u'dht': {u'username': u'', u'password': u'', u'type': 4, u'port': 3128, u'hostname': u'192.168.0.7'}}, }

```

So it looks like it set proxies before actually parsing core.conf?

Same with me, deluge 1.3.5-1 and libtorrent-rasterbar 0.16.2-1 and 0.16.3-1 under Arch Linux. I tried a proxy, was surprised by the high speed and then tried to type in bogus IPs, one starting with 255. etc. The torrents kept downloading. Then I started wireshark and noticed that all connections on deluge's port are to real peer addresses, not to the proxy address (well, obvious since it works with bogus IPs as a proxy).
I used HTTP proxy on the port 3128. I used the GUI to set it up, but checked core.conf, too and it shows everything like it should be.
Seems to me like the proxy option is broken now (if it ever worked).

No, still having direct connections with peers.
I had the same problems with ktorrent and didn't find any proxy settings in transmission, only got it to work with utorrent under wine, which is horribly inconvenient.

Can you please try with qbittorrent as it uses the same 0.16 libtorrent library.

What the OP reports does not make sense (works 1.3.4 and not 1.3.5) as there have been no major changes and certainly not in the proxy code however the fact you are using lt 0.16 and not 0.15 (which is what 1.3 was designed for) could be a factor here whereas the OP's bug is likely related to [#2109](/ticket/2109 "#2109: bug: Proxy settings not being cleared from session.state (closed: Fixed)").

The problem will either be that somehow Deluge is failing to pass the proxy settings to libtorrent or there is an issue in libtorrent itself which would require reporting upstream.

Hi! I'm terribly sorry about the delay. Deluge 1.3.5 is indeed work via proxy with:
libtorrent-rasterbar-0.15.9
py27-libtorrent-rasterbar-0.15.9

and ignores the proxy settings with
libtorrent-rasterbar-0.16.x
py27-libtorrent-rasterbar-0.16.x

So it's looks like libtorrent is the culprit. Dunno if it's an regression or some api change.

### [comment:7](#comment:7) by Calum, [12 years ago](/timeline?from=2012-09-19T14%3A55%3A39Z&precision=second "See timeline at 09/19/2012 02:55:39 PM")

The only documented api change in [​proxy settings](http://www.rasterbar.com/products/libtorrent/manual.html#proxy-settings) from 0.15 to 0.16 are the addition of `proxy_hostnames` and `proxy_peer_connections` for which the python bindings are missing and that may be the issue.

Ok, so should I bug upstream or you can prepare more quality bug report to them (I didn't dig both deluge and libtorrent internals)? Would adding this functions into python bindings automagically fix deluge work behind proxy, or it should be modified too?

And by the way [#2109](/ticket/2109 "#2109: bug: Proxy settings not being cleared from session.state (closed: Fixed)") is unrelated issue, but I was caught by it too. This is the reason why I remove ~/.config/deluge before testing. So just want to say, that "it annoys me too".

### follow-up: [11](#comment:11) [comment:10](#comment:10) by arvid, [12 years ago](/timeline?from=2012-09-20T02%3A22%3A38Z&precision=second "See timeline at 09/20/2012 02:22:38 AM")

The proxy settings did change in libtorrent 0.16. There is now only a single proxy setting and the previous ones just forward to that one setting.

The reason why they were coalesced was that introducing uTP (which are peers over UDP), along with DHT (also over UDP) and UDP trackers. It didn't make much sense in ever separating by peer/not peer. It doesn't make sense to announce to the DHT or a UDP tracker via the proxy, and then not accept peer connections over the proxy.

There is a risk that if deluge is setting the proxy settings, and then setting some other proxy setting to nothing, that last one overrides the first ones. One of the assumptions in the backwards-compatibility logic was that you wouldn't overwrite a proxy setting with something you didn't want set.

It's possible something went wrong in the python binding as well. I'll take a look at that.

Thanks arvid, I think that is the crux of the issue and explains the weirdness I was seeing; all proxies details being identical, when testing earlier with simple lt client.

I didn't see any issue with settings values with the bindings so the only outstanding issue would be those missing options.

The code in pref manager certainly does cycle through every proxy and set it so the last one will override all others:

[​http://git.deluge-torrent.org/deluge/tree/deluge/core/preferencesmanager.py#n431](http://git.deluge-torrent.org/deluge/tree/deluge/core/preferencesmanager.py#n431)

rm and ku could you try setting all the proxies (dht, web, tracker & dht) to see if that works?

Cas, I always set them all while testing/regular use - see the original message. It just didn't work.

Hmmh. Somehow my comment from yesterday didn't get posted.
First of all, I am setting all 4 proxies. Though the only bearable free anonymous proxy i found was HTTPS and I'm using HTTP (no HTTPS option in deluge). Are HTTPS proxies supported by deluge/libtorrent?
I also tried to downgrade to libtorrent-rasterbar 0.15.10 yesterday (I can't find an older version, since Arch Linux' repos only hold the latest version of packages and I purged my package cache several months ago). Still direct connections to peers (first it wouldn't even start, some problem with the classic mode and wouldn't connect to the daemon, after deleting session.state it worked, but lost all the torrents' states).
I also tried to install qbittorrent, but it wouldn't build from AUR. qbittorrent-bin wouldn't start because of a symbol lookup error (EDIT: managed it to start with libtorrent-rasterbar 0.16.3-1. Also no HTTPS option and also direct connections to peers).

Sorry for the off-topic, but are there any other torrent clients under linux, that suport HTTPS proxy and magnet links? Vuze only connects to one peer from 1600+ and has a direct connection to him, utorrent under wine crashes all the time and doesn't download from TPB's magnet links. I'd also like to try a free anonymous SOCKS proxy, but can't find one.

Oops. I just found out where I was wrong. The whole time the daemon was running with 0.16-3 (Help->About). It doesn't start with 0.15.x at all. Googling showed that I might need boost-libs 1.48.0 for that to work, this would break other packages for me.

Just tested in Ubuntu 10.4 in VirtualBox - both deluge 1.2.2 and qbittorrent 2.2.5 work with that proxy with libtorrent 0.14.10.0.
I also tested fatrat (it also depends on libtorrent-rasterbar) with 0.16.3 and it didn't work, too. So indeed, it seems like something was changed or broken with libtorrent 0.16.x

Yep I looked again at the Deluge code and it will not overwrite if the proxy in set to None and testing with simple client and Deluge shows the Python bindings appear to get and set ok so this suggests a deeper issue in lt 0.16.

I would suggest moving the discussion to libtorrent bug tracker.

### [comment:17](#comment:17) by arvid, [12 years ago](/timeline?from=2012-09-29T04%3A25%3A22Z&precision=second "See timeline at 09/29/2012 04:25:22 AM")

I notice that you're using an HTTP proxy.

I would expect the following:

* http trackers would use the proxy
* TCP bittorrent connections would use the proxy via CONNECT
* uTP bittorrent connections would \_not\_ use the proxy (since it doesn't support UDP)
* udp trackers would \_not\_ use the proxy
* DHT would \_not\_ use the proxy.

Is it possible that you see uTP traffic and expect it to go via the proxy? uTP support is new in 0.16.x.

It's possible to disable uTP support by setting session\_settings::enable\_incoming\_utp and session\_settings::enable\_outgoing\_utp to false (I don't think this is exposed in Deluge though).

Alternatively, you could use a SOCKS5 proxy instead, which does support UDP.

Just wiped and went down to Debian Stable and installed Deluge from repositories (1.2.3, libtorrent-rasterbar 0.14.10) and Deluge is still ignoring proxy settings. It also ignores proxy settings when tsocks is used.

what are the symptoms you see to determine that Deluge ignores proxy settings?

Are you running netcat to listen on the proxy port and look for incoming connections?
Do you wireshark the traffic to make sure the packets that look like bittorrent all goes to the proxy?

I have been trying to reproduce this without any success, and I'm looking for clues of differences in our setup.
For instance, keep in mind that when you use an HTTP proxy, only some traffic can go through it.

I'm using a socks5 proxy - using ssh -D 8081. I'm using a much simpler method to check if it works, so here's what I see:

1. Torrents will start downloading even when the ssh tunnel has not been started.
2. Torrents that start while the tunnel is active do not stop when the tunnel is killed.
3. The IP of my client in the swarm will either show up as being my "real" IP, or will only show the IP of the proxy for a short time before switching over to my "real" IP.

Deluge totaly ignores socks5 proxy.
I'm trying to use socks5 with privateinternetaccess.
My real ip shows up on the swarm, and Deluge starts downloading even if I put wrong username password.
I tested on uTorrent, and it works as expected.
If I put correct info, my real ip doesn't show up, and if I put wrong user/pass it doesn't work.

deluged: 1.3.10

I just monitored Deluge with Wireshark and found that it's connecting directly to peers despite having a working proxy. However I have noticed some interesting behavior:

If I change one number in the proxy IP, for example, to a non-working proxy, no downloads work; everything is frozen. So Deluge will only download given a working proxy; it's just not using that proxy.

Tested on 3.1.13 on Windows, via an account with a VPS provider, and then checking access to a magnet link on [​http://ipmagnet.services.cbcdn.com/](http://ipmagnet.services.cbcdn.com/)

This bug still occurs; the Socks5 proxy setting is ignored by Deluge.

Ok I think I see the issue, since libtorrent 0.16 there is only one proxy setting and the old way that Deluge sets the proxy settings using `peer`, `web` etc when applied are overwriting the previous values so if `dht` is empty that is likely to be the last item set which would clear the values.

The workaround for now is to set all the proxies `peer`, `web`, `tracker`, `dht` to the same values.

This definitely applies to lt 1.1. and 1.0.

Did you read my last comment? There is only one proxy now. So peer proxy values are now used for all proxies. See [#2991](/ticket/2991 "#2991: bug: Proxy settings not displayed correctly (closed: Fixed)")

And still the IP is leaked! Even with the latest version 1.3.15. No matter what I do. It doesn't have to do with the settings. I can clearly see my IP in the Torrent swarm, when checking from different client downloading the same torrent. Why aren't you giving this more attention? This should clearly be one of the highest priorities. The fact that I know it is leaking, prevents me from using Deluge, so I can be safe. But what about all the other users who perhaps unknowingly are unable to hide their IP in the swarm?!

This is incorrect in my situation. Even with identical values for all the proxies, the IP is visible.

Let us be honest here :) This bug has been open for five years. It's not a stretch to say that you cannot trust Deluge with your privacy, now or in the future.

Under no circumstances I blame the developers for not fixing the bug. I do blame them for offering a no-working feature for five years.

Oh, I blame them for claiming the fix works. As a user, I should not be doublechecking the security.

Wow, just tried Deluge for the first time... I did not expect that. 5 years already?? Guys, this is nonsense. Does not work for me either:

> [INFO ] 23:59:01 daemon:124 Deluge daemon 1.3.10

It is completely ignoring my Proxy settings.

Time wasted, removing Deluge now. Thanks.

try using the ltConfig plugin to set the anonymous\_mode and force\_proxy settings, this should accomplish what you want. references below

Socks5 proxy for tracker still doesn't work.

Output of `deluge -v`:

```
deluge: 1.3.15
libtorrent: 1.1.12.0

```

My use case is a little different, my tracker IP is banned from ISP.
Feels bad about the bug existed for such a long time.

Maybe I have to give other BT client a try.

I'm also having problems. Windows 10 fresh install, + Latest deluge 1.3.15

Setting Socks 5 proxy causes deluge to reset all preferences to default on next launch.

I am using 1.3.15 on windows 10 (pro, x64). I use SOCKS5 with authentication. "all preferences" not reset on next launch.

If I change the ip address first octet to 255, pause torrent, restart, there is no traffic as expected. Worryingly there is no popup error shown. Tracker status has an error, "socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network"

Restoring the correct address BUT also entering improper credentials does not resume data as expected. Again only pause restart updates the tracker error message, "error SOCKS authentication error"

Restoring correct credentials does not resume data until torrent paused and resumed.

Aside from requisite pause/restart this is the expected behavior.

Similar testing done with qBitTorrent as suggested in this thread 7 years ago.

Hi, adding to this. I have the latest version of Deluge running and all latest libraries from Deluge sources VS Ubuntu. It runs perfectly EXCEPT this bug being tracked here.

1. I can setup my Proxy Credentials just fine.
2. I can check the two boxes, or just one box. But it doesn't stick
3. Is there a way to do this another way? From CLI?

See the two attachments for the Version Number and the Error.

Any help on this would be appreciated.

Just thought I'd reply here to add that deluge 1.3.15 does not appear to be using my proxy settings These settings have been in place since I installed deluge months ago, all of those downloads are from within the last 24h. Surely my IP would not be showing up on iknowwhatyoudownload.com were it using the proxy? Pretty damn concerning tbh.

James Mickens is a researcher

in the Distributed systems

group at Microsoft’s Redmond

lab. His current research

focuses on web applications,

with an emphasis on the design of Javascript

frameworks that allow developers to

diagnose and fix bugs in widely deployed

web applications. James also works on fast,

scalable storage systems for datacenters.

James received his PhD in computer science

from the University of Michigan, and a

bachelor’s degree in computer science from

georgia Tech. mickens@microsoft.com

Sometimes, when I check my work email, I’ll find a message that says

“Talk Announcement: Vertex-based Elliptic Cryptography on N-way
Bojangle Spaces.” I’ll look at the abstract for the talk, and it will say

something like this: “It is well-known that five-way secret sharing has been
illegal since the Protestant Reformation [Luther1517]. However, using recent
advances in polynomial-time Bojangle projections, we demonstrate how a set
of peers who are frenemies can exchange up to five snide remarks that are
robust to Bojangle-chosen plaintext attacks.” I feel like these emails start in
the middle of a tragic but unlikely-to-be-interesting opera. Why, exactly, have
we been thrust into an elliptical world? Who, exactly, is Bojangle, and why do
we care about the text that he chooses? If we care about him because he has
abducted our families, can I at least exchange messages with those family
members, and if so, do those messages have to be snide? Researchers who
work on problems like these remind me of my friends who train for triath-
lons. When I encounter such a friend, I say, “In the normal universe, when
are you ever going to be chased by someone into a lake, and then onto a bike,
and then onto a road where you can’t drive a car, but you can run in a wetsuit?
Will that ever happen? If so, instead of training for such an event, perhaps a
better activity is to discover why a madman is forcing people to swim, then
bike, and then run.” My friend will generally reply, “Triathlons are good exer-
cise,” and I’ll say, “That’s true, assuming that you’ve made a series of bad life
decisions that result in you being hunted by an amphibious Ronald McDon-
ald.” My friend will say, “How do you know that it’s Ronald McDonald who’s
chasing me?”, and I’ll say “OPEN YOUR EYES WHO ELSE COULD IT BE?”,
and then my friend will stop talking to me about triathlons, and I will be okay
with this outcome.

In general, I think that security researchers have a problem with public relations. Secu-
rity people are like smarmy teenagers who listen to goth music: they are full of morbid
and detailed monologues about the pervasive catastrophes that surround us, but they are
much less interested in the practical topic of what people should do before we’re inevitably
killed by ravens or a shortage of black mascara. It’s like, websites are amazing BUT DON’T
CLICK ON THAT LINK, and your phone can run all of these amazing apps BUT MANY
OF YOUR APPS ARE EVIL, and if you order a Russian bride on Craigslist YOU MAY GET
A CONFUSED FILIPINO MAN WHO DOES NOT LIKE BEING SHIPPED IN A BOX. It’s
not clear what else there is to do with computers besides click on things, run applications,
and fill spiritual voids using destitute mail-ordered foreigners. If the security people are
correct, then the only provably safe activity is to stare at a horseshoe whose integrity has

been verified by a quorum of Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman.
Somehow, I am not excited to live in the manner of a Pilgrim
who magically has access to 3-choose-2 {Rivest, Shamir, Adle-
man}, mainly because, if I were a bored Pilgrim who possessed
a kidnapping time machine, I would kidnap Samuel L. Jackson
or Robocop, not mathematical wizards from the future who
would taunt me with their knowledge of prime numbers and
how “Breaking Bad” ends.

The only thing that I’ve ever wanted for Christmas is an
automated way to generate strong yet memorable passwords.
Unfortunately, large swaths of the security community are
fixated on avant garde horrors such as the fact that, during
solar eclipses, pacemakers can be remotely controlled with a
garage door opener and a Pringles can. It’s definitely unfor-
tunate that Pringles cans are the gateway to an obscure set
of Sith-like powers that can be used against the 0.002% of
the population that has both a pacemaker and bitter enemies
in the electronics hobbyist community. However, if someone
is motivated enough to kill you by focusing electromagnetic
energy through a Pringles can, you probably did something to
deserve that. I am not saying that I want you dead, but I am
saying that you may have to die so that researchers who study
per-photon HMACs for pacemaker transmitters can instead
work on making it easier for people to generate good passwords.
“But James,” you protest, “there are many best practices for
choosing passwords!” Yes, I am aware of the “use a vivid image”
technique, and if I lived in a sensory deprivation tank and I had
never used the Internet, I could easily remember a password
phrase like “Gigantic Martian Insect Party.” Unfortunately, I
have used the Internet, and this means that I have seen, heard,
and occasionally paid money for every thing that could ever be
imagined. I have seen a video called “Gigantic Martian Insect
Party,” and I have seen another video called “Gigantic Martian
Insect Party 2: Don’t Tell Mom,” and I hated both videos, but
this did not stop me from directing the sequel “Gigantic Mar-
tian Insect Party Into Darkness.” Thus, it is extremely difficult
for me to generate a memorable image that can distinguish
itself from the seething ocean of absurdities that I store as a
result of consuming 31 hours of media in each 24-hour period.

So, coming up with a memorable image is difficult, and to make
things worse, the security people tell me that I need different
passwords for different web sites. Now I’m expected to remem-
ber both “Gigantic Martian Insect Party” and “Structurally
Unsound Yeti Tote-bag,” and I have to somehow recall which
phrase is associated with my banking web site, and which one
is associated with some other site that doesn’t involve extrater-
restrial insects or Yeti accoutrements. This is uncivilized and
I demand more from life. Thus, when security researchers tell
me that they’re not working on passwords, it’s like physicists
from World War II telling me that they’re not working on radar
or nuclear bombs, but instead they’re unravelling the mystery
of how bumblebees fly. It’s like, you are so close, and yet so far.
You almost get it, but that’s worse than not getting it at all.

My point is that security people need to get their priorities
straight. The “threat model” section of a security paper resem-
bles the script for a telenovela that was written by a paranoid
schizophrenic: there are elaborate narratives and grand con-
spiracy theories, and there are heroes and villains with fantas-
tic (yet oddly constrained) powers that necessitate a grinding
battle of emotional and technical attrition. In the real world,
threat models are much simpler (see Figure 1). Basically, you’re
either dealing with Mossad or not-Mossad. If your adversary is
not-Mossad, then you’ll probably be fine if you pick a good pass-
word and don’t respond to emails from ChEaPestPAiNPi11s@
virus-basket.biz.ru. If your adversary is the Mossad, YOU’RE
GONNA DIE AND THERE’S NOTHING THAT YOU CAN DO
ABOUT IT. The Mossad is not intimidated by the fact that you
employ https://. If the Mossad wants your data, they’re going to
use a drone to replace your cellphone with a piece of uranium
that’s shaped like a cellphone, and when you die of tumors filled
with tumors, they’re going to hold a press conference and say
“It wasn’t us” as they wear t-shirts that say “IT WAS DEFI-
NITELY US,” and then they’re going to buy all of your stuff
at your estate sale so that they can directly look at the photos
of your vacation instead of reading your insipid emails about
them. In summary, https:// and two dollars will get you a bus
ticket to nowhere. Also, SANTA CLAUS ISN’T REAL. When it
rains, it pours.

This World of Ours

The Mossad/not-Mossad duality is just one of the truths that
security researchers try to hide from you. The security com-
munity employs a variety of misdirections and soothing words
to obscure the ultimate nature of reality; in this regard, they
resemble used car salesmen and Girl Scouts (whose “cookie
sales” are merely shell companies for the Yakuza). When you
read a security paper, there’s often a sentence near the begin-
ning that says “assume that a public key cryptosystem exists.”
The authors intend for you to read this sentence in a breezy,
carefree way, as if establishing a scalable key infrastructure
is a weekend project, akin to organizing a walk-in closet or
taming a chinchilla. Given such a public key infrastructure, the
authors propose all kinds of entertaining, Ferris Bueller-like
things that you can do, like taking hashes of keys, and arrang-
ing keys into fanciful tree-like structures, and determining
which users are bad so that their keys can be destroyed, or
revoked, or mixed with concrete and rendered inert. To better
describe the Mendelian genetics of keys, the authors will define
kinky, unnatural operators for the keys, operators that are
described as unholy by the Book of Leviticus and the state of
Alabama, and whose definitions require you to parse opaque,
subscript-based sentences like “Let KR ₩ KT represent the
semi-Kasparov foo-dongle operation in a bipartite XYabc space,
such that the modulus is spilt but a new key is not made.”

This Caligula-style key party sounds like great fun, but con-
structing a public key infrastructure is incredibly difficult in
practice. When someone says “assume that a public key cryp-
tosystem exists,” this is roughly equivalent to saying “assume
that you could clone dinosaurs, and that you could fill a park
with these dinosaurs, and that you could get a ticket to this
‘Jurassic Park,’ and that you could stroll throughout this
park without getting eaten, clawed, or otherwise quantum
entangled with a macroscopic dinosaur particle.”  With public
key cryptography, there’s a horrible, fundamental challenge
of finding somebody, anybody, to establish and maintain the
infrastructure. For example, you could enlist a well-known
technology company to do it, but this would offend the refined
aesthetics of the vaguely Marxist but comfortably bourgeoisie
hacker community who wants everything to be decentralized
and who non-ironically believes that Tor is used for things
besides drug deals and kidnapping plots. Alternatively, the
public key infrastructure could use a decentralized “web-
of-trust” model; in this architecture, individuals make their
own keys and certify the keys of trusted associates, creating
chains of attestation. “Chains of Attestation” is a great name
for a heavy metal band, but it is less practical in the real, non-
Ozzy-Ozbourne-based world, since I don’t just need a chain
of attestation between me and some unknown, filthy stranger
— I also need a chain of attestation for each link in that chain.
This recursive attestation eventually leads to fractals and
H.P. Lovecraft-style madness. Web-of-trust cryptosystems

also result in the generation of emails with incredibly short
bodies (e.g., “R U gonna be at the gym 2nite?!?!?!?”) and multi-
kilobyte PGP key attachments, leading to a packet framing
overhead of 98.5%. PGP enthusiasts are like your friend with
the ethno-literature degree whose multi-paragraph email
signature has fourteen Buddhist quotes about wisdom and
mankind’s relationship to trees. It’s like, I GET IT. You care
deeply about the things that you care about. Please leave me
alone so that I can ponder the inevitability of death.

Even worse than the PGP acolytes are the folks who claim that
we can use online social networks to bootstrap a key infra-
structure. Sadly, the people in an online social network are the
same confused, ill-equipped blunderhats who inhabit the phys-
ical world. Thus, social network people are the same people
who install desktop search toolbars, and who try to click on the
monkey to win an iPad, and who are willing to at least enter-
tain the notion that buying a fortune-telling app for any more
money than “no money” is a good idea. These are not the best
people in the history of people, yet somehow, I am supposed
to stitch these clowns into a rich cryptographic tapestry that
supports key revocation and verifiable audit trails. One time,
I was on a plane, and a man asked me why his laptop wasn’t
working, and I tried to hit the power button, and I noticed that
the power button was sticky, and I said, hey, why is the power
button sticky, and he said, oh, IT’S BECAUSE I SPILLED AN
ENTIRE SODA ONTO IT BUT THAT’S NOT A PROBLEM
RIGHT? I don’t think that this dude is ready to orchestrate
cryptographic operations on 2048-bit integers.

Another myth spread by security researchers is that the planet
Earth contains more than six programmers who can correctly
use security labels and information flow control (IFC). This
belief requires one to assume that, even though the most popu-
lar variable names are “thing” and “thing2,” programmers will
magically become disciplined software architects when con-
fronted with a Dungeons-and-Dragons-style type system that
requires variables to be annotated with rich biographical data
and a list of vulnerabilities to output sinks. People feel genuine
anxiety when asked if they want large fries for just 50 cents
more, so I doubt that unfathomable lattice-based calculus is
going to be a hit with the youths. I mean, yes, I understand how
one can use labels to write a secure version of HelloWorld(),
but once my program gets bigger than ten functions, my desire
to think about combinatorial label flows will decrease and be
replaced by an urgent desire to DECLASSIFY() so that I can
go home and stop worrying about morally troubling phrases
like “taint explosion” that are typically associated with the
diaper industry and FEMA. I realize that, in an ideal world, I
would recycle my trash, and contribute 10% of my income to
charity, and willingly accept the cognitive overhead of fine-
grained security labels. However, pragmatists understand that

This World of Ours

I will spend the bulk of my disposable income on comic books,
and instead of recycling, I will throw all of my trash into New
Jersey, where it will self-organize into elaborate “Matrix”-like
simulations of the seagull world, simulations that consist solely
of choking-hazard-sized particles and seagull-shaped objects
that are not seagulls and that will not respond to seagull mat-
ing rituals by producing new seagull children. This is definitely
a problem, but problem identification is what makes science
fun, and now we know that we need to send SWAT teams into
New Jersey to disarm a trash-based cellular automaton that
threatens the seagull way of life. Similarly, we know that IFC
research should not focus on what would happen if I some-
how used seventeen types of labels to describe three types of
variables. Instead, IFC research should focus on what will
happen when I definitely give all my variables The God Label
so that my program compiles and I can return to my loved ones.
[Incidentally, I think that “The God Label” was an important
plot device in the sixth “Dune” novel, but I stopped reading
that series after the fifth book and my seven-hundredth time
reading a speech that started “WHOEVER CONTROLS THE
SPICE CONTROLS THE (SOME THING WHICH IS NOT
THE SPICE).” Also note that if a police officer ever tries to give
you a speeding ticket, do not tell him that you are the Kwisatz
Haderach and You Can See Where No Bene Gesserit Can See
and you cannot see a speeding ticket. This defense will not hold
up in court, and the only “spice” that you will find in prison is
made of mouthwash and fermented oranges.]

The worst part about growing up is that the world becomes
more constrained. As a child, it seems completely reasonable to
build a spaceship out of bed sheets, firecrackers, and lawn fur-
niture; as you get older, you realize that the S.S. Improbable will
not take you to space, but instead a lonely killing field of fire,
Child Protective Services, and awkward local news interviews,
not necessarily in that order, but with everything showing up
eventually. Security research is the continual process of dis-
covering that your spaceship is a deathtrap. However, as John
F. Kennedy once said, “SCREW IT WE’RE GOING TO THE
MOON.” I cannot live my life in fear because someone named
PhreakusMaximus at DefConHat 2014 showed that you can
induce peanut allergies at a distance using an SMS message
and a lock of your victim’s hair. If that’s how it is, I accept it and
move on. Thinking about security is like thinking about where
to ride your motorcycle: the safe places are no fun, and the fun
places are not safe. I shall ride wherever my spirit takes me,
and I shall find my Gigantic Martian Insect Party, and I will,
uh, probably be rent asunder by huge cryptozoological man-
dibles, but I will die like Thomas Jefferson: free, defiant, and
without a security label.

To trace software back to the source and define the moving parts in a complex
supply chain, provenance needs to be there from the very beginning. It’s the
verifiable information about software artifacts describing where, when and how
something was produced. For higher SLSA levels and more resilient integrity
guarantees, provenance requirements are stricter and need a deeper, more
technical understanding of the predicate.

This document defines the following predicate type within the [in-toto
attestation](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation) framework:

```
"predicateType": "https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1"

```
> Important: Always use the above string for `predicateType` rather than what is
> in the URL bar. The `predicateType` URI will always resolve to the latest
> minor version of this specification. See [parsing rules](#parsing-rules) for
> more information.

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”,
“SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

## Purpose

Describe how an artifact or set of artifacts was produced so that:

* Consumers of the provenance can verify that the artifact was built according
  to expectations.
* Others can rebuild the artifact, if desired.

This predicate is the RECOMMENDED way to satisfy the SLSA v1.0 [provenance
requirements](requirements#provenance-generation).

## Model

Provenance is an attestation that a particular build platform produced a set of
software artifacts through execution of the `buildDefinition`.

![Build Model](/spec/v1.0/images/provenance-model.svg)

The model is as follows:

* Each build runs as an independent process on a multi-tenant build platform.
  The `builder.id` identifies this platform, representing the transitive
  closure of all entities that are [trusted](/spec/v1.0/principles#trust-systems-verify-artifacts) to faithfully run the build and
  record the provenance. (Note: The same model can be used for platform-less
  or single-tenant build platforms.)

  + The build platform implementer SHOULD define a security model for the build
    platform in order to clearly identify the platform’s boundaries, actors,
    and interfaces. This model SHOULD then be used to identify the transitive
    closure of the trusted build platform for the `builder.id` as well as the
    trusted control plane.
* The build process is defined by a parameterized template, identified by
  `buildType`. This encapsulates the process that ran, regardless of what
  platform ran it. Often the build type is specific to the build platform
  because most build platforms have their own unique interfaces.
* All top-level, independent inputs are captured by the parameters to the
  template. There are two types of parameters:

  + `externalParameters`: the external interface to the build. In SLSA,
    these values are untrusted; they MUST be included in the provenance and
    MUST be verified downstream.
  + `internalParameters`: set internally by the platform. In SLSA, these
    values are trusted because the platform is trusted; they are OPTIONAL
    and need not be verified downstream. They MAY be included to enable
    reproducible builds, debugging, or incident response.
* All artifacts fetched during initialization or execution of the build
  process are considered dependencies, including those referenced directly by
  parameters. The `resolvedDependencies` captures these dependencies, if
  known. For example, a build that takes a git repository URI as a parameter
  might record the specific git commit that the URI resolved to as a
  dependency.
* During execution, the build process might communicate with the build
  platform’s control plane and/or build caches. This communication is not
  captured directly in the provenance, but is instead implied by `builder.id`
  and subject to [SLSA Requirements](/spec/v1.0/requirements). Such
  communication SHOULD NOT influence the definition of the build; if it does,
  it SHOULD go in `resolvedDependencies` instead.
* Finally, the build process outputs one or more artifacts, identified by
  `subject`.

For concrete examples, see [index of build types](#index-of-build-types).

## Parsing rules

This predicate follows the in-toto attestation [parsing rules](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/blob/main/spec/v1/README.md#parsing-rules). Summary:

* Consumers MUST ignore unrecognized fields unless otherwise noted.
* The `predicateType` URI includes the major version number and will always
  change whenever there is a backwards incompatible change.
* Minor version changes are always backwards compatible and “monotonic.”
  Such changes do not update the `predicateType`.
* Unset, null, and empty field values MUST be interpreted equivalently.

## Schema

*NOTE: This section describes the fields within `predicate`. For a description
of the other top-level fields, such as `subject`, see [Statement](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/blob/main/spec/v1/statement.md).*

### Provenance

REQUIRED for SLSA Build L1: `buildDefinition`, `runDetails`

| Field Type Description| `buildDefinition` [BuildDefinition](#builddefinition) The input to the build. The accuracy and completeness are implied by `runDetails.builder.id`. | `runDetails` [RunDetails](#rundetails) Details specific to this particular execution of the build. | | | | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### BuildDefinition

REQUIRED for SLSA Build L1: `buildType`, `externalParameters`

| Field Type Description| `buildType` string ([TypeURI](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/blob/main/spec/v1/field_types.md#typeuri)) Identifies the template for how to perform the build and interpret the parameters and dependencies.  The URI SHOULD resolve to a human-readable specification that includes: overall description of the build type; schema for `externalParameters` and `internalParameters`; unambiguous instructions for how to initiate the build given this BuildDefinition, and a complete example. Example: <https://slsa-framework.github.io/github-actions-buildtypes/workflow/v1> | `externalParameters` object The parameters that are under external control, such as those set by a user or tenant of the build platform. They MUST be complete at SLSA Build L3, meaning that that there is no additional mechanism for an external party to influence the build. (At lower SLSA Build levels, the completeness MAY be best effort.)  The build platform SHOULD be designed to minimize the size and complexity of `externalParameters`, in order to reduce fragility and ease [verification](/spec/v1.0/verifying-artifacts). Consumers SHOULD have an expectation of what “good” looks like; the more information that they need to check, the harder that task becomes.  Verifiers SHOULD reject unrecognized or unexpected fields within `externalParameters`. | `internalParameters` object The parameters that are under the control of the entity represented by `builder.id`. The primary intention of this field is for debugging, incident response, and vulnerability management. The values here MAY be necessary for reproducing the build. There is no need to [verify](/spec/v1.0/verifying-artifacts) these parameters because the build platform is already trusted, and in many cases it is not practical to do so. | `resolvedDependencies` array ([ResourceDescriptor](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/blob/main/spec/v1/resource_descriptor.md)) Unordered collection of artifacts needed at build time. Completeness is best effort, at least through SLSA Build L3. For example, if the build script fetches and executes “example.com/foo.sh”, which in turn fetches “example.com/bar.tar.gz”, then both “foo.sh” and “bar.tar.gz” SHOULD be listed here. | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

The BuildDefinition describes all of the inputs to the build. It SHOULD contain
all the information necessary and sufficient to initialize the build and begin
execution.

The `externalParameters` and `internalParameters` are the top-level inputs to the
template, meaning inputs not derived from another input. Each is an arbitrary
JSON object, though it is RECOMMENDED to keep the structure simple with string
values to aid verification. The same field name SHOULD NOT be used for both
`externalParameters` and `internalParameters`.

The parameters SHOULD only contain the actual values passed in through the
interface to the build platform. Metadata about those parameter values,
particularly digests of artifacts referenced by those parameters, SHOULD instead
go in `resolvedDependencies`. The documentation for `buildType` SHOULD explain
how to convert from a parameter to the dependency `uri`. For example:

```
"externalParameters": {
    "repository": "https://github.com/octocat/hello-world",
    "ref": "refs/heads/main"
},
"resolvedDependencies": [{
    "uri": "git+https://github.com/octocat/hello-world@refs/heads/main",
    "digest": {"gitCommit": "7fd1a60b01f91b314f59955a4e4d4e80d8edf11d"}
}]

```

Guidelines:

* Maximize the amount of information that is implicit from the meaning of
  `buildType`. In particular, any value that is boilerplate and the same
  for every build SHOULD be implicit.
* Reduce parameters by moving configuration to input artifacts whenever
  possible. For example, instead of passing in compiler flags via an external
  parameter that has to be [verified](/spec/v1.0/verifying-artifacts) separately, require the
  flags to live next to the source code or build configuration so that
  verifying the latter automatically verifies the compiler flags.
* In some cases, additional external parameters might exist that do not impact
  the behavior of the build, such as a deadline or priority. These extra
  parameters SHOULD be excluded from the provenance after careful analysis
  that they indeed pose no security impact.
* If possible, architect the build platform to use this definition as its
  sole top-level input, in order to guarantee that the information is
  sufficient to run the build.
* When build configuration is evaluated client-side before being sent to the
  server, such as transforming version-controlled YAML into ephemeral JSON,
  some solution is needed to make [verification](/spec/v1.0/verifying-artifacts) practical. Consumers need a
  way to know what configuration is expected and the usual way to do that is
  to map it back to version control, but that is not possible if the server
  cannot verify the configuration’s origins. Possible solutions:

  + (RECOMMENDED) Rearchitect the build platform to read configuration
    directly from version control, recording the server-verified URI in
    `externalParameters` and the digest in `resolvedDependencies`.
  + Record the digest in the provenance[1](#fn1) and use a separate
    provenance attestation to link that digest back to version control. In
    this solution, the client-side evaluation is considered a separate
    “build” that SHOULD be independently secured using SLSA, though securing
    it can be difficult since it usually runs on an untrusted workstation.
* The purpose of `resolvedDependencies` is to facilitate recursive analysis of
  the software supply chain. Where practical, it is valuable to record the
  URI and digest of artifacts that, if compromised, could impact the build. At
  SLSA Build L3, completeness is considered “best effort”.

### RunDetails

REQUIRED for SLSA Build L1: `builder`

| Field Type Description| `builder` [Builder](#builder) Identifies the build platform that executed the invocation, which is trusted to have correctly performed the operation and populated this provenance. | `metadata` [BuildMetadata](#buildmetadata) Metadata about this particular execution of the build. | `byproducts` array ([ResourceDescriptor](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/blob/main/spec/v1/resource_descriptor.md)) Additional artifacts generated during the build that are not considered the “output” of the build but that might be needed during debugging or incident response. For example, this might reference logs generated during the build and/or a digest of the fully evaluated build configuration.  In most cases, this SHOULD NOT contain all intermediate files generated during the build. Instead, this SHOULD only contain files that are likely to be useful later and that cannot be easily reproduced. | | | | | | | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Builder

REQUIRED for SLSA Build L1: `id`

| Field Type Description| `id` string ([TypeURI](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/blob/main/spec/v1/field_types.md#typeuri)) URI indicating the transitive closure of the trusted build platform. This is [intended](/spec/v1.0/verifying-artifacts#step-1-check-slsa-build-level) to be the sole determiner of the SLSA Build level.  If a build platform has multiple modes of operations that have differing security attributes or SLSA Build levels, each mode MUST have a different `builder.id` and SHOULD have a different signer identity. This is to minimize the risk that a less secure mode compromises a more secure one.  The `builder.id` URI SHOULD resolve to documentation explaining:   * The scope of what this ID represents. * The claimed SLSA Build level. * The accuracy and completeness guarantees of the fields in the provenance. * Any fields that are generated by the tenant-controlled build process and not   verified by the trusted control plane, except for the `subject`. * The interpretation of any extension fields.  | `builderDependencies` array ([ResourceDescriptor](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/blob/main/spec/v1/resource_descriptor.md)) Dependencies used by the orchestrator that are not run within the workload and that do not affect the build, but might affect the provenance generation or security guarantees. | `version` map (string→string) Map of names of components of the build platform to their version. | | | | | | | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

The build platform, or builder for short, represents the transitive
closure of all the entities that are, by necessity, [trusted](/spec/v1.0/principles#trust-systems-verify-artifacts) to faithfully run
the build and record the provenance. This includes not only the software but the
hardware and people involved in running the service. For example, a particular
instance of [Tekton](https://tekton.dev/) could be a build platform, while
Tekton itself is not. For more info, see [Build
model](/spec/v1.0/terminology#build-model).

The `id` MUST reflect the trust base that consumers care about. How detailed to
be is a judgement call. For example, GitHub Actions supports both GitHub-hosted
runners and self-hosted runners. The GitHub-hosted runner might be a single
identity because it’s all GitHub from the consumer’s perspective. Meanwhile,
each self-hosted runner might have its own identity because not all runners are
trusted by all consumers.

Consumers MUST accept only specific signer-builder pairs. For example, “GitHub”
can sign provenance for the “GitHub Actions” builder, and “Google” can sign
provenance for the “Google Cloud Build” builder, but “GitHub” cannot sign for
the “Google Cloud Build” builder.

Design rationale: The builder is distinct from the signer in order to support
the case where one signer generates attestations for more than one builder, as
in the GitHub Actions example above. The field is REQUIRED, even if it is
implicit from the signer, to aid readability and debugging. It is an object to
allow additional fields in the future, in case one URI is not sufficient.

### BuildMetadata

REQUIRED: (none)

| Field Type Description| `invocationId` string Identifies this particular build invocation, which can be useful for finding associated logs or other ad-hoc analysis. The exact meaning and format is defined by `builder.id`; by default it is treated as opaque and case-sensitive. The value SHOULD be globally unique. | `startedOn` string ([Timestamp](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/blob/main/spec/v1/field_types.md#timestamp)) The timestamp of when the build started. | `finishedOn` string ([Timestamp](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/blob/main/spec/v1/field_types.md#timestamp)) The timestamp of when the build completed. | | | | | | | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Extension fields

Implementations MAY add extension fields to any JSON object to describe
information that is not captured in a standard field. Guidelines:

* Extension fields SHOULD use names of the form `<vendor>_<fieldname>`, e.g.
  `examplebuilder_isCodeReviewed`. This practice avoids field name collisions
  by namespacing each vendor. Non-extension field names never contain an
  underscore.
* Extension fields MUST NOT alter the meaning of any other field. In other
  words, an attestation with an absent extension field MUST be interpreted
  identically to an attestation with an unrecognized (and thus ignored)
  extension field.
* Extension fields SHOULD follow the [monotonic principle](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/blob/main/spec/v1/README.md#parsing-rules),
  meaning that deleting or ignoring the extension SHOULD NOT turn a DENY

## Migrating from 0.2

To migrate from [version 0.2](/provenance/v0.2) (`old`), use the following
pseudocode. The meaning of each field is unchanged unless otherwise noted.

```
{
    "buildDefinition": {
        // The `buildType` MUST be updated for v1.0 to describe how to
        // interpret `inputArtifacts`.
        "buildType": /* updated version of */ old.buildType,
        "externalParameters":
            old.invocation.parameters + {
            // It is RECOMMENDED to rename "entryPoint" to something more
            // descriptive.
            "entryPoint": old.invocation.configSource.entryPoint,
            // It is OPTIONAL to rename "source" to something more descriptive,
            // especially if "source" is ambiguous or confusing.
            "source": old.invocation.configSource.uri,
        },
        "internalParameters": old.invocation.environment,
        "resolvedDependencies":
            old.materials + [
            {
                "uri": old.invocation.configSource.uri,
                "digest": old.invocation.configSource.digest,
            }
        ]
    },
    "runDetails": {
        "builder": {
            "id": old.builder.id,
            "builderDependencies": null,  // not in v0.2
            "version": null,  // not in v0.2
        },
        "metadata": {
            "invocationId": old.metadata.buildInvocationId,
            "startedOn": old.metadata.buildStartedOn,
            "finishedOn": old.metadata.buildFinishedOn,
        },
        "byproducts": null,  // not in v0.2
    },
}

```

The following fields from v0.2 are no longer present in v1.0:

* `entryPoint`: Use `externalParameters[<name>]` instead.
* `buildConfig`: No longer inlined into the provenance. Instead, either:
  + If the configuration is a top-level input, record its digest in
    `externalParameters["config"]`.
  + Else if there is a known use case for knowing the exact resolved
    build configuration, record its digest in `byproducts`. An example use
    case might be someone who wishes to parse the configuration to look for
    bad patterns, such as `curl | bash`.
  + Else omit it.
* `metadata.completeness`: Now implicit from `builder.id`.
* `metadata.reproducible`: Now implicit from `builder.id`.

## Change history

### v1.0

Major refactor to reduce misinterpretation, including a minor change in model.

* Significantly expanded all documentation.
* Altered the model slightly to better align with real-world build platforms,
  align with reproducible builds, and make verification easier.
* Grouped fields into `buildDefinition` vs `runDetails`.
* Renamed:
  + `parameters` -> `externalParameters` (slight change in semantics)
  + `environment` -> `internalParameters` (slight change in semantics)
  + `materials` -> `resolvedDependencies` (slight change in semantics)
  + `buildInvocationId` -> `invocationId`
  + `buildStartedOn` -> `startedOn`
  + `buildFinishedOn` -> `finishedOn`
* Removed:
  + `configSource`: No longer special-cased. Now represented as
    `externalParameters` + `resolvedDependencies`.
  + `buildConfig`: No longer inlined into the provenance. Can be replaced
    with a reference in `externalParameters` or `byproducts`, depending on
    the semantics, or omitted if not needed.
  + `completeness` and `reproducible`: Now implied by `builder.id`.
* Added:
  + ResourceDescriptor: `annotations`, `content`, `downloadLocation`,
    `mediaType`, `name`
  + Builder: `builderDependencies` and `version`
  + `byproducts`
* Changed naming convention for extension fields.

Differences from RC1 and RC2:

* Renamed `systemParameters` (RC1 + RC2) -> `internalParameters` (final).
* Changed naming convention for extension fields (in RC2).
* Renamed `localName` (RC1) -> `name` (RC2).
* Added `annotations` and `content` (in RC2).

### v0.2

Refactored to aid clarity and added `buildConfig`. The model is unchanged.

* Replaced `definedInMaterial` and `entryPoint` with `configSource`.
* Renamed `recipe` to `invocation`.
* Moved `invocation.type` to top-level `buildType`.
* Renamed `arguments` to `parameters`.
* Added `buildConfig`, which can be used as an alternative to `configSource`
  to validate the configuration.

### rename: slsa.dev/provenance

Renamed to “slsa.dev/provenance”.

### v0.1.1

* Added `metadata.buildInvocationId`.

### v0.1

Initial version, named “in-toto.io/Provenance”

1. The `externalParameters` SHOULD reflect reality. If clients
   send the evaluated configuration object directly to the build server, record
   the digest directly in `externalParameters`. If clients upload the
   configuration object to a temporary storage location and send that location
   to the build server, record the location in `externalParameters` as a URI
   and record the `uri` and `digest` in `resolvedDependencies`. [↩](#fnref1)

### [Mon Oct 28th 2024 - qBittorrent v5.0.1 release](#mon-oct-28th-2024---qbittorrent-v5.0.1-release)

qBittorrent v5.0.1 was released.

Libtorrent 1.2.x users who stuck with it due to memory usage issues, you might want to try the libtorrent 2.0.x variant and change the disk IO type to the new option "Simple pread/pwrite". Memory usage issues should be eliminated with it. More info in PR [#21300](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/pull/21300).

**WINDOWS:** If you like a native UI look and feel and don't care about dark mode use the `System` Qt style in the Settings (`Behavior` category). If you want the best possible dark mode support use the `Fusion` Qt style (it should be the default already).

### [Sun Oct 22th 2023 - qBittorrent v4.6.0 release](#sun-oct-22th-2023---qbittorrent-v4.6.0-release)

qBittorrent v4.6.0 was released.

A lot of work has been done for version 4.6.0. The changelog below includes the most notable changes for end users along with the author for each change. Also, I want to thank all the users, like [**thalieht**](https://github.com/thalieht) and [**xavier2k6**](https://github.com/xavier2k6), who constantly help with testing PRs and doing bug triaging.

**WINDOWS:** Only Windows 10+ is now supported.

**SECURITY NOTICE:** WebUI users YOU MUST change the default Webui credentials (aka "adminadmin") when exposing the WebUI to the Internet. There are reports([1](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/issues/13833), [2](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/issues/18731), [3](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/issues/16529), [4](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/issues/19738)) that this is possibly exploited in the wild. This will be remedied in a followup release where the default credentials will be disabled and a credentials change will be forced.

**macOS:** Builds are self-signed now. It should help with macOS permissions dialogs.

### [Monday November 16th 2020 - Donation info updates](#monday-november-16th-2020---donation-info-updates)

The donation info has been updated to better reflect the expectations of donating to the project. Donations are made as a "Thank You" and with no expectation of any kind of obligation by us, eg having to implement feature X or Y.

The development of qbittorrent is done by volunteers and we don't employ programmers or other people to work on the project. There are a few lead programmers that coordinate most things on github and also contribute code.

Donations are appreciated as a "Thank You". You can choose to help with the server costs (website, forum, domain) and/or donate to lead programmers.

Because the development is volunteer driven, we can't set very specific goals. At the end of the day a volunteer will fix/implement whatever pleases him/her. We can't dictate to volunteers to work on specific things if they don't want to. The same applies to lead programmers. We are volunteers too.

However, if you want specific features implemented or issues solved you may look at our [Bountysource page](https://www.bountysource.com/teams/qbittorrent/issues). There you can post a monetary bounty for an issue/feature and **maybe** someone is incentivized enough to fix/implement it.

For details, see [donation page](/donate).

PS: The old cryptocoin addresses have been retired. Please don't continue sending funds there. Accumulated funds will be used as reserves mostly for covering server costs in the future.

### [Thursday October 22nd 2020 - qBittorrent v4.3.0.1 release](#thursday-october-22nd-2020---qbittorrent-v4.3.0.1-release)

qBittorrent v4.3.0.1 was released.

This is a minor release to address crashes on Windows related to torrents with URL seeds (`HTTP Sources` in the qbittorrent window). These crashes were exposed due to boost 1.74. Boost 1.73 doesn't have this problem. However, libtorrent also fixed the issue on their end so the Windows installers use the newer libtorrent code.

The rest of the release is almost the same as v4.3.0 (see changelog). Since other platforms weren't affected only Windows builds will be made available for this version.

v4.3.0.1 changelog:

* WINDOWS: NSIS: Update Italian translation (bovirus)

qBittorrent v4.3.0 was released.

This is a major version release due to the high number of accumulated changes and due to the long time since the last release.

Some notes:

* If you want faster tracker announce rate or are having a slower client exit(compared to 4.2.x) then you may try increasing the `Max concurrent HTTP announce` limit from advanced settings.
* The latest version of libtorrent used contains many important fixes compared to the last one, including memory leaks and speed issues due to wrong caching logic on Windows.
* Qt 5.15.1 is used which offers far better HiDPI support. However, the torrent context menu will close after each tag selection.
* Brave users can download experimental builds from "Actions CI" on github.

### [Thursday September 7th 2017 - qBittorrent v3.3.16 and 3.4.0beta2\_20170709\_cbfbae14090 release](#thursday-september-7th-2017---qbittorrent-v3.3.16-and-3.4.0beta2_20170709_cbfbae14090-release)

Since it was a month since the last stable and v3.4.0 seems to be delayed just a bit, it was a good time to backport critical fixes and do another v3.3.x release.

Alongside v3.3.16 there is beta2 of v3.4.0. It contains various fixes for the things mentioned in the first beta plus a few new additions. See changelog. This beta works on Windows XP (32-bit) too. macOS packages are ready too.

Finally, the future stable version will be **v4.0.0 not v3.4.0**

v3.3.16 changelog:

* BUGFIX: Better memory footprint when using libtorrent 1.1.x. The cache is turned off by default(`0 (disabled)` value in the settings). The value `-1 (auto)` makes it use 1/8 of your RAM. (sledgehammer999)
* BUGFIX: Skip user input events when adding torrent. Closes #7327. (glassez)
* BUGFIX: Avoid memory leak in the speed graph. (Chocobo1)
* WEBUI: Fix validating wrong header field. X-Forwarded-Host is a foreign proxy setting, it isn't the same as qbt's local setting and thus it makes no sense to verify it. Closes #7311. (Chocobo1)
* WINDOWS: Fix connection problems when a specific interface/ip is configured. (sledgehammer999)
* WINDOWS: Disable skipping of loopback interfaces. This fixes the absence of VPN tunnel interfaces under Windows and works around the QTBUG-32349. Fixes #7291. (Evengard)
* WINDOWS: The installer detects the 64bit running process too. (vlakoff)

3.4.0beta2\_20170709\_cbfbae14090 changelog:

* FEATURE: Prefill torrent name when creating a new torrent. Closes #7229. (Chocobo1)
* FEATURE: Expose more libtorrent options in advanced settings (Chocobo1)
* BUGFIX: Fix explicit Torrent Management Mode in Add New Torrent dialog. Closes #5602. (sledgehammer999)
* BUGFIX: Fix calculation of 'Average time in queue' stat under libtorrent 1.1.x (sledgehammer999)

* WEBUI: Add auto torrent management to webui context menu (addresses #6815) (Thomas Piccirello)
* WINDOWS: Use dpiawareness=1 on Windows. Closes #5393. (sledgehammer999)

Windows packages for v3.4.0beta\_20170807\_0320f9d5b5e are released.

### [Thursday August 3rd 2017 - qBittorrent v3.3.15 release](#thursday-august-3rd-2017---qbittorrent-v3.3.15-release)

qBittorrent v3.3.15 was released. Very minor release to fix a possibly annoying problem.
3.4.0beta is being prepped and will be released this weekend. Stay tuned.

* BUGFIX: Temporary subfolder wasn't being deleted. (glassez)

### [Thursday July 20th 2017 - qBittorrent v3.3.14 release](#thursday-july-20th-2017---qbittorrent-v3.3.14-release)

qBittorrent v3.3.14 was released.

1. This release is made mainly to fix the previous problematic fix for Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks via the webui.
2. It also contains another Webui fix for a DNS rebinding attack. For all WebUI users, if your qBittorrent server is assigned with a domain name, it is recommended to enter the domain name in `GUI: Options -> WebUI tab -> Server domains textbox` or in `config: Preferences section -> WebUI/ServerDomains` in order to defend against DNS rebinding attacks.
3. For macOS users: This is my first attempt to have a shortcut to `Applications` folder in the dmg. I hope that I didn't screw up the presentation.
4. Google has decided that qBittorrent is a persona non-grata. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/6obxsa/google_bans_bittorrent/) reddit post for more info.
5. Either this weekend or the next one you will get a beta for v3.4.0. It has A LOT of new features so help in finding grave bugs. Keep checking back to see if it is posted.

### [Tuesday March 7th 2017 - NOTICE to tracker operators: User agent change](#tuesday-march-7th-2017---notice-to-tracker-operators%3A-user-agent-change)

Starting from the next version (v3.3.12) qBittorrent will use the following user-agent format:

```
qBittorrent/A.B.C.DE

```

`A`, `B`, `C` and `D` are numbers indicating `VERSION_MAJOR`, `VERSION_MINOR`, `VERSION_BUGFIX` and `VERSION_BUILD` respectively.

If `D` is zero it will be omitted. The 3rd dot(`.`) will be omitted in this case.

`A`, `B` and `C` will always be present.

`E` is a string and possible values of it are `alpha`, `beta` and `rc`. They might not appear in all lowercase. Also they might appear numbered eg `alpha2`.

If `E` is empty it will be omitted. This indicates a stable release.

There is no connection between `D` and `E`. One might be present even if the other isn't.
To sum up and give an example, the user agent that v3.3.12 will use is `qBittorrent/3.3.12`.

### [Saturday February 13th 2016 - The forum is restored](#saturday-february-13th-2016---the-forum-is-restored)

As mentioned [earlier](#forum_compromise), there were reports that the forums from a bunch of bittorrent related sites were hacked. As a result we switched off our forum to investigate. To the best of our knowledge we weren't hacked. We didn't discover any evidence of unauthorized entry. We highly suspect that the self-proclaimed "hacker" was a fraud instead. Just so you know the passwords are saved hashed and salted in the database. It is very difficult to reverse this and obtain the real password. In any case, we reset all the passwords and switched on the forum. You already should have received an email about your new password.

### [Tuesday December 22nd 2015 - Forum compromise](#tuesday-december-22nd-2015---forum-compromise)

It has come to our attention that the forum database containing user info **might** have been compromised by a third unauthorized party. We aren't able to tell if this is true from our logs. And we aren't sure if the hack was real. See more info in this [article](https://torrentfreak.com/hackers-grab-deluge-and-qbittorrent-user-databases-151221/). If the database was indeed compromised it was probably through a bug of the forum software. We had installed version 2.0.11 of [SMF](https://www.simplemachines.org/), which is the latest stable. As a precaution we have taken down the forums. The passwords weren't saved as plaintext, but as salted hashes. It will make it very difficult for the hackers to recover the real passwords. However, we strongly recommend you to change your password to any other site on which you used the same password. We are sorry for the inconvenience.

This is a Mac OS X release. This is the same source as v3.1.11. The difference is in the way it is compiled. Now it doesn't crash during launch due to incorrect dynamic library linking. Provided by user **DomT4** (github)

### [Thursday November 27th 2014 - Ubuntu PPAs](#thursday-november-27th-2014---ubuntu-ppas)

As you may have noticed already our Ubuntu PPAs were broken for quite some time now. Chris Dumez, who maintained them, was unable to fix them. Today I managed to create new and working PPAs. Head over to the [download page](download) and find the new PPAs. You should remove the old ones to avoid conflicts.

### [Wednesday October 22nd 2014 - qBittorrent v3.1.11 release](#wednesday-october-22nd-2014---qbittorrent-v3.1.11-release)

qBittorrent v3.1.11 was released. I know I said that v3.1.10 would be the last of the v3.1.x series. However there were 2-3 regressions that warranted a new release. In the meantime, more bugfixes and features were committed by others. So v3.1.11 **should be** the last unless we find some serious issues with it.

Also some Windows 7 users experienced freezing of the GUI. We tracked it down to a specific commit in boost 1.56. So until boost fixes it, I am going to use boost 1.55 for Windows releases.

### [June 19th 2011 - qBittorrent on Gitorious](#june-19th-2011---qbittorrent-on-gitorious)

We have decided to move qBittorrent source code to [Gitorious](https://gitorious.org/qbittorrent) and to use GIT instead of SVN. We are hoping this will facilitate code contributions through merge requests and GIT patches.

We need more people contributing code, the development team is way too small at the moment.

The bug tracker is still on [Launchpad](https://bugs.qbittorrent.org), and the file releases will stay on [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/qbittorrent/files/) for now.

I would also like to move the Website to use an engine such as Wordpress or Drupal to facilitate editing. I - however - do not have the spare time to take on this task right now. If anybody is interested in working on this, please contact [me](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#85e6edf7ecf6c5f4e7ecf1f1eaf7f7e0ebf1abeaf7e2).

First of all, we would like to wish you all a happy new year. To enjoy this new year even more, I'm planning to release qBittorrent v2.1.0 really soon and We uploaded a first release candidate today. We are hoping that people will test this release candidate and report issues as soon as possible so that we can make a stable release before the end of this month.

v2.1.0 brings some long-waited features such as headless running (GUI can be disabled at compilation time by passing --disable-gui flag) and torrent categorizing/labeling. Renaming of torrents and their content is now also supported.

qBittorrent v2.0.5 to v2.1.0rc1 changelog:

* FEATURE: Graphical User Interface can be disabled at compilation time (headless running)
* FEATURE: Torrents can be labeled/categorized
* FEATURE: Labeled torrent can be downloaded corresponding subfolders
* FEATURE: Disk cache size can be set from preferences
* FEATURE: Peer Exchange (PeX) can be disabled from preferences
* FEATURE: Append !.qB extension to incomplete files option (libtorrent >= v0.15 only)
* FEATURE: Torrent files/folders can be renamed (torrent addition dialog or files properties)
* FEATURE: uTorrent compatible tracker list support (use torrentz.com url as a default)
* FEATURE: Better proxy support and preferences remodeling
* FEATURE: qBittorrent can identify itself as uTorrent, Vuze or KTorrent (Any stable version)
* FEATURE: Torrents can be renamed in transfer list
* BUGFIX: Use XDG folders (.cache, .local) instead of .qbittorrent
* COSMETIC: Use checkboxes to filter torrent content instead of comboboxes
* COSMETIC: Use alternating row colors in transfer list (set in program preferences)
* COSMETIC: Added a spin box to speed limiting dialog for manual input

### [December 13th 2009 - qBittorrent v2.0.1](#december-13th-2009---qbittorrent-v2.0.1)

We have just uploaded a first bugfix release for qBittorrent v2.0. This version brings support for Hex Magnet Links which are used by some web sites such as [The Pirate Bay](https://thepiratebay.org/).

Another good news is that qBittorrent project won [Les Ã©toiles du libre](http://www.etoiles-du-libre.org) Free Software competition, in desktop applications.

qBittorrent v2.0.0 to v2.0.1 changelog:

* BUGFIX: ÂµTorrent user-agent is now spoofed correctly
* BUGFIX: Fix column hiding behavior when queueing system is disabled
* BUGFIX: Fix link to plugins.qbittorrent.org in plugins dialog
* BUGFIX: ~/qBT\_dir is created only when it is actually used
* BUGFIX: Fix possible missing slot message (toggleSelectedTorrentsSuperSeeding)
* BUGFIX: Fix possible crash in torrent properties (files)
* BUGFIX: Added Hex Magnet Links support (Thanks Haypo)

### [December 10th 2009 - qBittorrent v2.0.0 final release](#december-10th-2009---qbittorrent-v2.0.0-final-release)

As planned, qBittorrent v2.0.0 final was released today after a rather long period of test, which was necessary due to the large number of features/changes introduced. We really received a lot of feedback regarding v2.0.0 betas and release candidates and we would like to thank the brave people who tested it.

qBittorrent v2.0.0 changelog is available [here](http://qbittorrent.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/qbittorrent/trunk/Changelog?revision=3083&view=markup).

### [December 2nd 2009 - qBittorrent v2.0.0rc4 and competition finalist](#december-2nd-2009---qbittorrent-v2.0.0rc4-and-competition-finalist)

Just a short article to announce that qBittorrent v2.0.0rc4 was released. It is stable and the UI will not change. I am now simply waiting for late translation updates so that I can make a final release (probably on December 10th)

Another good news is that qBittorrent project is now a finalist in "desktop applications" category in ["Les Etoiles Du Libre"](http://etoiles-du-libre.org) Free Software competition. The winning projects will be selected on December 12th so let's keep our fingers crossed!

### [November 28th 2009 - qBittorrent v2.0.0rc2 and more search engine plugins](#november-28th-2009---qbittorrent-v2.0.0rc2-and-more-search-engine-plugins)

We have released today a second release candidate for qBittorrent v2.0.0. A lot of users decided to give v2.0.0 a try as soon as they saw the screenshots and we thank them for their useful feedback. Thanks to their effort, qBittorrent v2.0.0 final will be released sooner than expected.

We also recently moved our wiki to Sourceforge and we wrote a [new documentation](https://doc.qbittorrent.org) for qBittorrent v2.0. The documentation is complete already.

Another recent news was that [Mininova](http://www.mininova.org) engine disabled access to over a million torrent files when it partly shut down its website due to legal issues. After this news, TorrentFreak published a list of [10 alternatives to Mininova](https://torrentfreak.com/10-alternatives-to-mininova-091126/). We decided it would be useful to support these 10 search engines in qBittorrent. As a result, we are currently publishing new plugins on [Plugins.qbittorrent.org](https://plugins.qbittorrent.org). 4 new plugins are available at the time I'm writing this news while qBittorrent already supported 3 engines listed in the Top 10. This means that only 3 more plugins are missing to support the whole Top 10.

### [November 17th 2009 - qBittorrent v1.5.6 release and qBittorrent v2.0.0 news](#november-17th-2009---qbittorrent-v1.5.6-release-and-qbittorrent-v2.0.0-news)

Here is another bugfix release for qBittorrent v1.5.x while waiting for the next major release: qBittorrent v2.0.0. Development on v2.0.0 is going really well and we are hoping it will be ready in a month or so. qBittorrent v2.0 brings a lot of new features and UI changes. The list of changes is available [here](http://qbittorrent.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/qbittorrent/trunk/Changelog?view=markup) but to summarize it should be a very close equivalent to the official Bittorrent client: ÂµTorrent, in all levels: features, UI, lightness.

qBittorrent v1.5.5 to v1.5.6 changelog:

* BUGFIX: RSS feed articles can now be displayed using keyboard arrows
* BUGFIX: RSS feed downloader can only process unread articles now
* BUGFIX: Fixed memory leak in RSS parser
* BUGFIX: Fixed possible crash in search autocompletion
* BUGFIX: Improved ETA calculation for big torrents
* BUGFIX: Fixed per-torrent speed limiting

# Direct Client-to-Client Protocol (DCC)

Daniel Oaks [Editor]
[ircdocs](http://ircdocs.horse/)
daniel@danieloaks.net

This document intends to be a useful overview and reference of DCC as it is implemented today. It is a [living specification](/about#living-specification) which is updated in response to feedback and implementations as they change. This document describes existing behaviour and what we consider best practices for new software.

If something written in here isn't interoperable with an IRC client you know of, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ircdocs/modern-irc/issues).

NOTE: This is NOWHERE NEAR FINISHED and may be ENTIRELY INACCURATE. Dragons be here, insane stuff be here.

Regardless of the accuracy of this specification, DCC in general is not encrypted (apart from the SDCC extension which is not widely-supported and does not verify any certificate details). I don't particularly like where DCC is at the moment, but with this document I'm hoping to start the discussion around properly encrypting direct connections, and/or building something that does so with the knowledge of what's currently out there.

You can contribute by sending pull requests to our [Github repository](https://github.com/ircdocs/modern-irc)!

# Introduction

The Direct Client-to-Client Protocol (DCC) has been the primary method of establishing connections directly between IRC clients for a long time now. Once established, DCC connections bypass the IRC network and servers, allowing for all sorts of data to be transferred between clients including files and direct chat sessions.

There have been many extensions to DCC through the years, such as XDCC, SDCC and others. This document intends to describe DCC as it works today and provide a useful specification for new client authors implementing this feature.

If you are a new software author implementing this feature, please keep in mind that **DCC has no encryption.** If you must implement DCC, please look at the [SDCC](#secure-dcc-sdcc) section at the bottom of this document so that you can implement even the most minor security measures for this protocol.

# Architecture

[CTCP](/ctcp) messages are used to initiate DCC sessions. Specifically, the [`DCC`](/ctcp#dcc) message is used to start and control DCC sessions.

This section details the types of DCC available, and how to open DCC sessions.

## DCC Query Syntax

The initial CTCP `DCC` query message has this format:

```
DCC <type> <argument> <host> <port>

```

`<type>` contains the type of DCC being initiated, such as `CHAT` or `SEND`. `<argument>` refers to a type-specific kind of argument, such as a filename. `<host>` represents to the IP address which should be connected to, and `<port>` refers to a valid port on which the connection should be established (the value of this parameter can also be `0`, in which case the rules below apply.

`<host>`, for legacy reasons, uses a ‘fun’ mixture of representations. For IPv4 hosts, this parameter is the string representation of the positive integer that is the IP address in network byte order (e.g. `127.0.0.1` is represented as `2130706433` in this param). For IPv6 hosts, clients instead support the standard, widely-implemented IPv6 hex representation separated by colons (e.g. `::1`).

Note that for DCC queries to work, the querying client MUST know its’ own public host address, or the address that the other client can use to access it. Clients have discovered this in various ways through the years, and this section doesn’t yet describe how to do so. However, clients `MUST NOT` try to discover this through the [`RPL_WELCOME`](/#rpl_welcome-001) numeric, as the prevalence of spoofed hostnames used today makes this infeasible on most public networks and introduces issues.

### Port 0

When port 0 is advertised on a DCC query, it signals that the sending client wishes to open a connection but cannot (or does not wish to) explicitly offer a listening port. This is commonly called Reverse DCC or Firewall-bypassing DCC (we refer to it as Reverse DCC in this document).

When a client receives a reverse DCC query, it means that the sending client wants the receiving client to establish the connection instead (with a valid port number in the `<port>` parameter). If the receiving client wishes to continue, they’ll send a request back to the client that originally sent them the query.

Reverse DCC interacts a bit strangely with the `RESUME` type, and is outlined below in the specific section.

## DCC CHAT

`CHAT` is used to establish chat sessions directly between clients. It should be noted that **plain DCC does not use any form of encryption and SHOULD be avoided.**

### Initiating Sessions

To initiate a `DCC CHAT` session, send a `CTCP` query with the format:

```
DCC CHAT <unused> <host> <port>

```

Where `<unused>` is a holding string – we recommend just using `"chat"` here. `<host>` and `<port>` are the host and the port the recipient connect to in order to establish the connection.

After receiving the query, the receiver will have the option of accepting or rejecting the chat request. End users MUST be given the option to either accept or ignore this request, as opening it will expose their public IP address.

To accept a given chat request, open a TCP connection to the given port. To reject a given request, simply ignore the query and do not respond to it.

### Sending Messages

After opening the direct TCP connection, clients will send lines to each other separated by the pair of characters `CR` `('\r', 0x0D)` and `LF` `('\n', 0x0A)`.

There are no prepended commands or verbs such as `PRIVMSG` and `NOTICE`.

#### ACTION

If one wishes to perform a standard [`CTCP ACTION`](/ctcp#action)-like message, they should prefix the line with `"\x01ACTION "`. That is, the standard CTCP delimiter `('\x01', 0x01)`, the verb `"ACTION"`, and a single space, before sending the client’s message.

Clients that receive a line prefixed with `"\x01ACTION "` MUST display that line as a standard [`CTCP ACTION`](/ctcp#action) message would be displayed.

*Example:*

```
  Raw:        \x01ACTION writes a specification

  Formatted:  * dan writes a specification

```
## DCC SEND

`SEND` is used to send another client a given file. This is done directly between clients to avoid the overhead of having to transfer files through the IRC server. It should be noted that **plain DCC does not use any form of encryption and SHOULD be avoided.**

### Initiating Sessions

To initiate a `DCC SEND` session, send a `CTCP` query with the format:

```
DCC SEND <filename> <host> <port>

```

`<filename>` is the filename of the file to be sent. `<host>` and `<port>` are the host and the port the recipient connect to in order to establish the connection.

After receiving the query, the receiver will have the option of accepting or rejecting the file send request. End users MUST be given the option to either accept or ignore this request, as opening it will expose their public IP address, and automatically receiving files on certain systems may be used to exploit vulnerabilities.

Clients SHOULD NOT allow saving files into system directories, directories that could affect the operation of the IRC client or the system as a whole. Clients SHOULD instead restrict saved files to a single directory chosen by the user or purposefully chosen to be the destination of received DCC files. End users MUST also be given the option to rename the file and save it under a different filename.

To accept a given chat request, open a TCP connection to the given port. To reject a given request, simply ignore the query and do not respond to it.

### Sending The File

After opening the direct TCP connection, the sending client sends the raw bytes of the file over the newly-established connection.

### Resuming The Send

This section is not yet written.

## DCC RESUME

This section is not yet written.

## DCC ACCEPT

This section is not yet written.

---

# Extensions

These are various extensions that change how DCC connections are established and used. These are detailed here.

## Secure DCC (SDCC)

In this method, the verb `SCHAT` is used instead of `CHAT` and `SSEND` is used instead of `SEND`. When using secure DCC, the direct TCP connection uses TLS rather than plaintext.

Although it uses TLS, the certificate on either side is not verified in any way, which means this is still not secure by today’s standards. However, it can help protect against dragnet data collection so it’s still a definite step up from regular plaintext DCC.

## Reverse / Firewall-bypassing DCC

This type of DCC request (that we call Reverse DCC) is used to bypass NAT and similar issues. The functionality is described above in the [Port 0](#port-0) section and relevant part of the [DCC RESUME](#dcc-resume) section.

## Extended DCC (XDCC)

XDCC (originally an acronym for Xabi’s DCC) is a set of additional commands to allow clients to list files available for download. As well, XDCC allows clients to request downloading a particular advertised file – upon which a `DCC SEND` session will be established by the side advertising the file.

## Setting up Dev Environment

Getting the basics to compile from source is pretty straightforward:

1. Clone the repo into your favorite IDE
2. Mark `core/src` and `uis/src` as project roots (source modules)
3. To the uis module, add `core/lib/*` and one of the swt.jars at `/uis/lib/`:

   `swt-win64.jar` on Windows

   `swt-cocoa-64.jar` on OSX

   `swt-linux-64.jar` on Linux (GTK)
4. To the core module, add `core/lib/*`
5. Make `uis` module depend on `core`. `Core` should not depend on `uis`

IntelliJ IDEA will do all these steps for you with its wizard.

### External Annotations

If you wish IntelliJ IDEA to show MessageBundle strings instead of keys, as well as reduce the number of NPE warnings, you can attach the external annotations either by:

* Project Settings->Modules->Paths->External Annotations
* in `<module>/<module>.iml` add to component:
  ```
  <annotation-paths>
    <root url="file://$MODULE_DIR$/../external-annotations" />
  </annotation-paths>

  ```

External Annotations definitions are a WIP and not complete list of definitions.

## Running in Dev Environment

Running is only few more steps:

* Main class is `com.biglybt.ui.Main` in module `uis`
* Working Directory should be a new folder, since the app will write things to it. Put the [`aereg.dll`](/BiglySoftware/BiglyBT/blob/master/core/lib/libWIN32Access/README.md) or `libOSXAccess.jnilib` in there.

  When a normal user is running the app, the working directory is where the jar, executable, and libraries (dll, so, jnilib) are.
* If you want a separate config dir from the default one, use VM Option `-Dazureus.config.path=<some config path>`
* Run it

## Release Installer Notes

We build our installers using [Install4j, multi-platform installer builder](https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/install4j/overview.html)

[![Install4j Logo](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4bbdd44bdf6a49e408a9b2b01c2217fa7c3eff24db406381d92fa8a4039004a0/68747470733a2f2f7777772e656a2d746563686e6f6c6f676965732e636f6d2f696d616765732f70726f647563745f62616e6e6572732f696e7374616c6c346a5f6c617267652e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4bbdd44bdf6a49e408a9b2b01c2217fa7c3eff24db406381d92fa8a4039004a0/68747470733a2f2f7777772e656a2d746563686e6f6c6f676965732e636f6d2f696d616765732f70726f647563745f62616e6e6572732f696e7374616c6c346a5f6c617267652e706e67)

Our binaries and installers up to and including v3.4 are signed with a digital signature of "Bigly Software". Releases after v3.4 will use an individual signing certificate and will bear the name "Arron Mogge (Open Source Developer)" denoting the identity of our team member responsible for signing.

# RCE Vulnerability in QBittorrent

---

In qBittorrent, the DownloadManager class has [ignored every SSL certificate validation error](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/blob/a126a7b4934d9e66fcedb60769523eb891da7086/src/base/net/downloadmanager.cpp#L154) that has ever happened, on every platform, for 14 years and 6 months since April 6 2010 with commit [9824d86](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/commit/9824d86a3cbecc9fd91f0462956ca575ef742110). The default behaviour changed to verifying on October 12 2024 with commit [3d9e971](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/commit/3d9e9715b4660b8f57c3648a62a4d83c67db9de5). The first patched release is version 5.0.1, released 2 days ago.

Note: this issue has now been assigned to [CVE-2024-51774](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-51774). These issues require MITM access, or DNS spoofing to exploit.

The usages of DownloadManager across the program are extensive, and affect searches, .torrent downloads, RSS feeds, favicon downloads and more. All of the following code paths accept any certificate whatsoever, whether expired, self-signed or both, in descending order of severity:

### **1. Malicious Executable loader with stealth functionality**

If you are running Windows and you do not have a recent enough build of Python installed, at launch qBittorrent will prompt you to install/update Python from a hardcoded URL so you can use the search plugin which requires it, [source](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/blob/2d185dc1c7932e775ecf5f2b0a7b7639ed8228f7/src/gui/mainwindow.cpp#L1579):

```
#ifdef Q_OS_WIN
            const QMessageBox::StandardButton buttonPressed = QMessageBox::question(this, tr("Missing Python Runtime")
                , tr("Python is required to use the search engine but it does not seem to be installed.\nDo you want to install it now?")
                , (QMessageBox::Yes | QMessageBox::No), QMessageBox::Yes);
            if (buttonPressed == QMessageBox::Yes)
                installPython();
...

#ifdef Q_OS_WIN
void MainWindow::installPython()
{
    setCursor(QCursor(Qt::WaitCursor));
    // Download python
    const auto installerURL = u"https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.4/python-3.12.4-amd64.exe"_s;
    Net::DownloadManager::instance()->download(
            Net::DownloadRequest(installerURL).saveToFile(true)
            , Preferences::instance()->useProxyForGeneralPurposes()
            , this, &MainWindow::pythonDownloadFinished);
}
```

If you click or hit enter on the auto-selected ‘Yes’ option, qBittorrent will then **\*\*download, execute and then delete the .exe\*\***, [source](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/blob/2d185dc1c7932e775ecf5f2b0a7b7639ed8228f7/src/gui/mainwindow.cpp#L1889);

```
void MainWindow::pythonDownloadFinished(const Net::DownloadResult &result)
{
    if (result.status != Net::DownloadStatus::Success)
    {
        ...
    }

    setCursor(QCursor(Qt::ArrowCursor));
    QProcess installer;
    qDebug("Launching Python installer in passive mode...");

    const Path exePath = result.filePath + u".exe";
    Utils::Fs::renameFile(result.filePath, exePath);
    installer.start(exePath.toString(), {u"/passive"_s});

    // Wait for setup to complete
    installer.waitForFinished(10 * 60 * 1000);

    qDebug("Installer stdout: %s", installer.readAllStandardOutput().data());
    qDebug("Installer stderr: %s", installer.readAllStandardError().data());
    qDebug("Setup should be complete!");

    // Delete temp file
    Utils::Fs::removeFile(exePath);

    // Reload search engine
    if ...
}
#endif // Q_OS_WIN
```

qBittorrent has had this behaviour from **June 2015** until the present, affecting v3.2.1 through v5.0.0 inclusive. The behaviour does not appear to be replicated for other OS variants, they just disable the search widget if Python is not found or is not recent enough.

When the executable has finished downloading, it will be stored in for example:

C:\Users\\_user\_\AppData\Local\Temp\\**is-G61QK.tmp**

Perhaps due to how `QProcess` instances behave, there will be two threads of the exe running and only one of them is killed after execution, the other persists in a sleeping state.

### **2. Arbitrary URL injection + Executable Download (Software Upgrade Context)**

If you are running an installed version of qBittorrent on Windows or Linux and not an `appImage` file, then it will conduct an update check by default on launch, and this entails downloading an RSS feed from a **hardcoded URL** in the form of an **XML document** to parse the information about program releases:

```
    void ProgramUpdater::checkForUpdates() const
{
    const auto RSS_URL = u"https://www.fosshub.com/feed/5b8793a7f9ee5a5c3e97a3b2.xml"_s;
    // Don't change this User-Agent. In case our updater goes haywire,
    // the filehost can identify it and contact us.
    Net::DownloadManager::instance()->download(
            Net::DownloadRequest(RSS_URL).userAgent(QStringLiteral("qBittorrent/" QBT_VERSION_2 " ProgramUpdater (www.qbittorrent.org)"))
            , Preferences::instance()->useProxyForGeneralPurposes(), this, &ProgramUpdater::rssDownloadFinished);
}
```

Then it will parse the XML, extract the URL if the version is higher than currently running, and prompt the user to visit this URL without any filtering or verification:

```
...
    if (type.compare(variant, Qt::CaseInsensitive) == 0)
            {
                qDebug("The last update available is %s", qUtf8Printable(version));
                if (!version.isEmpty())
                {
                    qDebug("Detected version is %s", qUtf8Printable(version));
                    if (isVersionMoreRecent(version))
                    {
                        m_newVersion = version;
                        m_updateURL = updateLink;
                    }
                }
                break;
            }
...
```

If the user accepts this prompt, they open this URL in their default browser. The expectation of the user is to receive an exe file and the context is one of trust, as the link/download came from software they run:

```
bool ProgramUpdater::updateProgram() const
{
    return QDesktopServices::openUrl(m_updateURL);
}
```

So, if a user is directed to any given filesharing site such as mediafire etc, they can download an attacker-controlled exe they expect to function like an upgrade. As the project is OSS, the latest version can easily be recompiled with additional backdoor functionality. The devs provide a [key](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/raw/master/5B7CC9A2.asc) to check the signature of the binary, but it has to be checked **and a verification failure must be respected** in order to protect a user.

### **3. RSS Feeds (Arbitrary URL injection)**

All RSS feeds parsed by the application go through DownloadManager, so they can be hijacked. The URLs visited by a victim can be observed and catalogued, and by nature they are static, long-lived URLs. The `link` element inside each entry is parsed directly and will be downloaded if double-clicked. This applies even without MITM tampering – you are a double click away from any URL inserted into any RSS feed you follow, either by the authors or by attackers who poison the feed.

```
            else if (name == u"link")
            {
                const QString link = (xml.attributes().isEmpty()
                                ? xml.readElementText().trimmed()
                                : xml.attributes().value(u"href"_s).toString());

                if (link.startsWith(u"magnet:", Qt::CaseInsensitive))
                {
                    article[Article::KeyTorrentURL] = link; // magnet link instead of a news URL
                }
                else
                {
                    // Atom feeds can have relative links, work around this and
                    // take the stress of figuring article full URI from UI
                    // Assemble full URI
                    article[Article::KeyLink] = (m_baseUrl.isEmpty() ? link : m_baseUrl + link);
                }
            }
```

What makes this one even more damaging is [CVE-2019-13640](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2019-13640/) which allowed remote command execution via shell metacharacters in the torrent name or current tracker parameters. This combination means the authentic RSS author need not send malicious data, as a MITM attacker can also do it.

### **4. Decompression library attack surface (0-click)**

At launch, by default the program will automatically download a .gz extension binary MaxMind GeopIP database from a hardcoded URL, and then extract it. If there are any vulnerabilities in zlib decompression, such as [CVE-2022-37434 the CVSS 9.8 Critical buffer overflow from 2022](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-37434), which **does not apply here** since the `inflateGetHeader()` function is not called, an attacker can target this attack surface with an arbitrary file up to 64MB, logging and returning after any errors;

```
    ...

    bool ok = false;
    const QByteArray data = Utils::Gzip::decompress(result.data, &ok);
    if (!ok)
    {
        LogMsg(tr("Could not decompress IP geolocation database file."), Log::WARNING);
        return;
    }
```

The code which parses the binary MaxMind database after decompression is well guarded as of 2024 but used to look different, potentially providing more attack surface. There is also an interesting [commit](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/commit/7d1ac06ce215057b3340caaea1fe99aa5a634a0c) where a contributor makes adjustments to the `gzip::decompress()` function which hints at a stack overflow, as the destination buffer was changed from static allocation on the stack to dynamic allocation on the heap, though it was not exploitable due to checks before it is written to:

```
-105           char tmpBuf[BUFSIZE] = {0};
+107           std::vector<char> tmpBuf(BUFSIZE);
```
## Exploit Possibilities

Because all the Python installer exe URLs and update RSS feed URLs are hardcoded, they can be trivially enumerated and a malicious script in MITM context can attack every vulnerable version. Better, the RSS feed URLs provide a fingerprint for the software as there is no other reason to visit one of those URLs unless qBittorrent is running. This means mass surveillance programs like PRISM and equivalent can easily detect qBittorrent users via passive traffic monitoring. Then, because there is no cert validation, there is no need for expensive and complex deployments like [QUANTUM](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/10/how_the_nsa_att.html) to perform a [Man-On-The-Side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-on-the-side_attack) attack – you can just spoof the destination server.

Another aspect of the URLs being hardcoded is that an adversary can selectively intercept only requests from qBittorrent which do not verify the connection, instead of alerting a victim when his browser/other applications fails to securely connect to the internet.

Because this software is open source, it is trivial to add a backdoor to it and recompile, and therefore give a victim fully functional software, avoiding the victim’s suspicion.

Scripting possibilities, when used in conjunction with mitmproxy using `-s` to supply a python script:

* Automated replacement of all Python exes with arbitrary exe: **RCE with a single click**
* Automated replacement of all qBittorrent update URLs in RSS feed: **Browser Hijacking/RCE with moderate user interaction**
* Automated replacement of all/specific links in qBittorrent RSS viewer: **RCE until 2019, Download Hijacking**

## Mitigations

Upgrade to v5.0.1 by downloading it **manually with a browser**, not via the update prompt in-app. Or just use another client, as Deluge and Transmission etc do not have this vulnerability.

## Notes

People dismiss attacks requiring MITM access as theoretical, dangerously forgetting the lessons of recent [history](https://epic.org/documents/epic-v-doj-prism/), and present realities in non-free countries like [China](https://github.com/net4people/bbs/issues/27), [UAE](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28541117) and [Kazakhstan](https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/kazakhstan-attempts-to-mitm-itscitizens). A CVE has been issued, and I have been in contact with the maintainers of the repo, though they have not commented on whether or not they intend to release a security advisory on Github.

| ``` Currently the Python SSL module requires the full chain, including all intermediaries, to be served in order to validate a TLS connection. This isn't *wrong* however a number of folks have had issues trying to setup a custom PyPI index in pip due to missing them. The believed the problem with validation to be in pip/Python because it works in their browser.  Essentially browsers have the ability to download missing intermediate certs using an url found inside the AIA data. This is slow and isn't generally recommended that you rely on it for any particular site. However it does mean that TLS connections work in more situations.  At the least this should probably be documented, and possibly the Python library be enhanced to be more browser like in this regard. ``` | | | |

| ``` Thx!  Let's update the docs for 2.7 to 3.4 first.   For AIA intermediate cert retrieval we have to use OpenSSL's verify hook. It's a pain to implement all necessary bits and hard to use, though. :( ``` | | | |

| ``` Perhaps the simplest thing here is to add a standard verify callback that catches verification errors, and returns the parsed server certificate as an attribute of the raised exception object.  From python, the exception can be caught and then the certificate data info used to fetch the intermediate certificate, and pass it into SSLContext.load_verify_locations().  This would force an extra client connection, but be less insane than trying to fetch and return the certificate from inside the SSL_CTX_set_verify() callback IMHO.  Does that sound workable?  Any hints for a would-be drive-by patcher? ``` | | | |
| [msg293894](#msg293894) - [(view)](msg293894) | Author: April King (april) | Date: 2017-05-17 21:50 |
| ``` Browsers universally support AIA chasing/fetching, as do a number of underlying OS libraries, such as Secure Transport (macOS) and schannel (Windows).  As a result, it is becoming increasingly common for server operators to fail to include the entire certificate chain in their handshake. By some measures, anywhere from 10 to over 30% of all TLS errors(1) are caused by missing intermediate certificates.  There are a handful of ways that scanners and other tools have worked around this issue. Some, like SSL Labs, do their own AIA chasing. Others make subprocess to other tools linked to OS libraries which invisibly perform AIA chasing, such as curl on macOS. Others, like Firefox, maintain a cache of intermediate certificates.  In any case, all of these solutions are concession to the reality that TLS is really hard and that it is largely impossible to solve this particular misconfiguration issue.  I myself write a popular tool(2) that does scanning of sites for missing security configurations. Although it's not explicitly focused on TLS, some of the underlying tests rely on a verified TLS connection.  For example, the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header can only be set on valid TLS connections.  I use requests (which uses httplib underneath), but I'm unable to tell if a given certificate error is because of either:  a) the certificate validation actually failed (for example, due to being expired), or b) there was a missing intermediate certificate and that things would have worked if AIA chasing was available  As a result, I have to tell people that their HSTS header can't be set. This is often incorrect, because browsers that do AIA chasing consider the connection perfectly secure for the purposes of HSTS.  It would be really nice if Python's httplib could be updated to do transparent AIA chasing, with the optional ability to turn it off. In an ideal world, the underlying TLS libraries (such as OpenSSL) would do this for us, but unfortunately as things stand now OpenSSL leaves it up to the applications themselves to perform chasing. According to Mozilla research (3), if implemented, it would reduce TLS errors by approximately 6% were AIA chasing always performed and successful.

| ``` Err, sorry, I may have been a bit unclear.  AIA chasing is not *universal* amongst browsers.  IE, Edge, Chrome, and Safari perform AIA chasing.  Firefox maintains a cache of intermediate certificate authorities.  I noted that a bit further underneath, but my apologies if it was confusing.  That said, every browser has a some chosen some underlying method to ameliorate this common TLS error.  It would be amazing if Python could similarly resolve this issue for developers. ``` | | | |

# Struct ClientBuilderCopy item path

[Source](../src/reqwest/async_impl/client.rs.html#83-85)
```
pub struct ClientBuilder { /* private fields */ }
```
Expand description

A `ClientBuilder` can be used to create a `Client` with custom configuration.

## Implementations[§](#implementations)

[Source](../src/reqwest/async_impl/client.rs.html#189-287)[§](#impl-ClientBuilder)
### impl [ClientBuilder](struct.ClientBuilder.html "struct reqwest::ClientBuilder")

[Source](../src/reqwest/async_impl/client.rs.html#193-286)
#### pub fn [new](#method.new)() -> Self

Constructs a new `ClientBuilder`.

This is the same as `Client::builder()`.

[Source](../src/reqwest/async_impl/client.rs.html#289-2001)[§](#impl-ClientBuilder-1)
### impl [ClientBuilder](struct.ClientBuilder.html "struct reqwest::ClientBuilder")

[Source](../src/reqwest/async_impl/client.rs.html#296-823)
#### pub fn [build](#method.build)(self) -> [Result](type.Result.html "type reqwest::Result")<[Client](struct.Client.html "struct reqwest::Client")>

Returns a `Client` that uses this `ClientBuilder` configuration.

##### [§](#errors)Errors

This method fails if a TLS backend cannot be initialized, or the resolver
cannot load the system configuration.

[Source](../src/reqwest/async_impl/client.rs.html#847-861)
#### pub fn [user\_agent](#method.user_agent)<V>(self, value: V) -> [ClientBuilder](struct.ClientBuilder.html "struct reqwest::ClientBuilder")where V: [TryInto](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/convert/trait.TryInto.html "trait core::convert::TryInto")<[HeaderValue](header/struct.HeaderValue.html "struct reqwest::header::HeaderValue")>, V::[Error](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/convert/trait.TryInto.html#associatedtype.Error "type core::convert::TryInto::Error"): [Into](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/convert/trait.Into.html "trait core::convert::Into")<[Error](https://docs.rs/http/1.1.0/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/http/error/struct.Error.html "struct http::error::Error")>,

Sets the `User-Agent` header to be used by this client.

##### [§](#example)Example

```
// Name your user agent after your app?
static APP_USER_AGENT: &str = concat!(
    env!("CARGO_PKG_NAME"),
    "/",
    env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION"),
);

let client = reqwest::Client::builder()
    .user_agent(APP_USER_AGENT)
    .build()?;
let res = client.get("https://www.rust-lang.org").send().await?;
```

[Source](../src/reqwest/async_impl/client.rs.html#885-890)
#### pub fn [default\_headers](#method.default_headers)(self, headers: [HeaderMap](header/struct.HeaderMap.html "struct reqwest::header::HeaderMap")) -> [ClientBuilder](struct.ClientBuilder.html "struct reqwest::ClientBuilder")

Sets the default headers for every request.

##### [§](#example-1)Example

```
use reqwest::header;
let mut headers = header::HeaderMap::new();
headers.insert("X-MY-HEADER", header::HeaderValue::from_static("value"));

// Consider marking security-sensitive headers with `set_sensitive`.
let mut auth_value = header::HeaderValue::from_static("secret");
auth_value.set_sensitive(true);
headers.insert(header::AUTHORIZATION, auth_value);

// get a client builder
let client = reqwest::Client::builder()
    .default_headers(headers)
    .build()?;
let res = client.get("https://www.rust-lang.org").send().await?;
```

[Source](../src/reqwest/async_impl/client.rs.html#908-915)
#### pub fn [cookie\_store](#method.cookie_store)(self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> [ClientBuilder](struct.ClientBuilder.html "struct reqwest::ClientBuilder")

Available on **crate feature `cookies`** only.

Enable a persistent cookie store for the client.

Cookies received in responses will be preserved and included in
additional requests.

By default, no cookie store is used. Enabling the cookie store
with `cookie_store(true)` will set the store to a default implementation.
It is **not** necessary to call [cookie\_store(true)](struct.ClientBuilder.html#method.cookie_store "method reqwest::ClientBuilder::cookie_store") if [cookie\_provider(my\_cookie\_store)](struct.ClientBuilder.html#method.cookie_provider "method reqwest::ClientBuilder::cookie_provider")
is used; calling [cookie\_store(true)](struct.ClientBuilder.html#method.cookie_store "method reqwest::ClientBuilder::cookie_store") *after* [cookie\_provider(my\_cookie\_store)](struct.ClientBuilder.html#method.cookie_provider "method reqwest::ClientBuilder::cookie_provider") will result
in the provided `my_cookie_store` being **overridden** with a default implementation.

##### [§](#optional)Optional

This requires the optional `cookies` feature to be enabled.

[Source](../src/reqwest/async_impl/client.rs.html#932-938)
#### pub fn [cookie\_provider](#method.cookie_provider)<C: [CookieStore](cookie/trait.CookieStore.html "trait reqwest::cookie::CookieStore") + 'static>( self, cookie\_store: [Arc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/alloc/sync/struct.Arc.html "struct alloc::sync::Arc")<C>, ) -> [ClientBuilder](struct.ClientBuilder.html "struct reqwest::ClientBuilder")

Available on **crate feature `cookies`** only.

Set the persistent cookie store for the client.

Cookies received in responses will be passed to this store, and
additional requests will query this store for cookies.

By default, no cookie store is used. It is **not** necessary to also call
[cookie\_store(true)](struct.ClientBuilder.html#method.cookie_store "method reqwest::ClientBuilder::cookie_store") if [cookie\_provider(my\_cookie\_store)](struct.ClientBuilder.html#method.cookie_provider "method reqwest::ClientBuilder::cookie_provider") is used; calling
[cookie\_store(true)](struct.ClientBuilder.html#method.cookie_store "method reqwest::ClientBuilder::cookie_store") *after* [cookie\_provider(my\_cookie\_store)](struct.ClientBuilder.html#method.cookie_provider "method reqwest::ClientBuilder::cookie_provider") will result
in the provided `my_cookie_store` being **overridden** with a default implementation.

##### [§](#optional-1)Optional

This requires the optional `cookies` feature to be enabled.

[Source](../src/reqwest/async_impl/client.rs.html#958-961)
#### pub fn [gzip](#method.gzip)(self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> [ClientBuilder](struct.ClientBuilder.html "struct reqwest::ClientBuilder")

Available on **crate feature `gzip`** only.

Enable auto gzip decompression by checking the `Content-Encoding` response header.

If auto gzip decompression is turned on:

* When sending a request and if the request’s headers do not already contain
  an `Accept-Encoding` **and** `Range` values, the `Accept-Encoding` header is set to `gzip`.
  The request body is **not** automatically compressed.
* When receiving a response, if its headers contain a `Content-Encoding` value of
  `gzip`, both `Content-Encoding` and `Content-Length` are removed from the
  headers’ set. The response body is automatically decompressed.

If the `gzip` feature is turned on, the default option is enabled.

##### [§](#optional-2)Optional

This requires the optional `gzip` feature to be enabled

[Source](../src/reqwest/async_impl/client.rs.html#981-984)
#### pub fn [brotli](#method.brotli)(self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> [ClientBuilder](struct.ClientBuilder.html "struct reqwest::ClientBuilder")

Available on **crate feature `brotli`** only.

Enable auto brotli decompression by checking the `Content-Encoding` response header.

If auto brotli decompression is turned on:

* When sending a request and if the request’s headers do not already contain
  an `Accept-Encoding` **and** `Range` values, the `Accept-Encoding` header is set to `br`.
  The request body is **not** automatically compressed.
* When receiving a response, if its headers contain a `Content-Encoding` value of
  `br`, both `Content-Encoding` and `Content-Length` are removed from the
  headers’ set. The response body is automatically decompressed.

If the `brotli` feature is turned on, the default option is enabled.

##### [§](#optional-3)Optional

This requires the optional `brotli` feature to be enabled

[Source](../src/reqwest/async_impl/client.rs.html#1004-1007)
#### pub fn [zstd](#method.zstd)(self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> [ClientBuilder](struct.ClientBuilder.html "struct reqwest::ClientBuilder")

Available on **crate feature `zstd`** only.

Enable auto zstd decompression by checking the `Content-Encoding` response header.

If auto zstd decompression is turned on:

* When sending a request and if the request’s headers do not already contain
  an `Accept-Encoding` **and** `Range` values, the `Accept-Encoding` header is set to `zstd`.
  The request body is **not** automatically compressed.
* When receiving a response, if its headers contain a `Content-Encoding` value of
  `zstd`, both `Content-Encoding` and `Content-Length` are removed from the
  headers’ set. The response body is automatically decompressed.

If the `zstd` feature is turned on, the default option is enabled.

##### [§](#optional-4)Optional

#### pub fn [deflate](#method.deflate)(self, enable: [bool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.bool.html)) -> [ClientBuilder](struct.ClientBuilder.html "struct reqwest::ClientBuilder")

Available on **crate feature `deflate`** only.

Enable auto deflate decompression by checking the `Content-Encoding` response header.

If auto deflate decompression is turned on:

* When sending a request and if the request’s headers do not already contain
  an `Accept-Encoding` **and** `Range` values, the `Accept-Encoding` header is set to `deflate`.
  The request body is **not** automatically compressed.
* When receiving a response, if it’s headers contain a `Content-Encoding` value that
  equals to `deflate`, both values `Content-Encoding` and `Content-Length` are removed from the
  headers’ set. The response body is automatically decompressed.

If the `deflate` feature is turned on, the default option is enabled.

##### [§](#optional-15)Optional

This requires the optional `default-tls`, `native-tls`, or `rustls-tls(-...)`
feature to be enabled.

#### pub fn [use\_native\_tls](#method.use_native_tls)(self) -> [ClientBuilder](struct.ClientBuilder.html "struct reqwest::ClientBuilder")

Available on **crate feature `native-tls`** only.

Force using the native TLS backend.

Since multiple TLS backends can be optionally enabled, this option will
force the `native-tls` backend to be used for this `Client`.

##### [§](#optional-16)Optional

This requires the optional `native-tls` feature to be enabled.

#### pub fn [use\_rustls\_tls](#method.use_rustls_tls)(self) -> [ClientBuilder](struct.ClientBuilder.html "struct reqwest::ClientBuilder")

Available on **crate feature `rustls-tls`** only.

Force using the Rustls TLS backend.

Since multiple TLS backends can be optionally enabled, this option will
force the `rustls` backend to be used for this `Client`.

##### [§](#optional-17)Optional

#### pub fn [use\_preconfigured\_tls](#method.use_preconfigured_tls)(self, tls: impl [Any](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/any/trait.Any.html "trait core::any::Any")) -> [ClientBuilder](struct.ClientBuilder.html "struct reqwest::ClientBuilder")

Available on **crate features `native-tls` or `rustls-tls`** only.

Use a preconfigured TLS backend.

If the passed `Any` argument is not a TLS backend that reqwest
understands, the `ClientBuilder` will error when calling `build`.

##### [§](#advanced)Advanced

This is an advanced option, and can be somewhat brittle. Usage requires
keeping the preconfigured TLS argument version in sync with reqwest,
since version mismatches will result in an “unknown” TLS backend.

If possible, it’s preferable to use the methods on `ClientBuilder`
to configure reqwest’s TLS.

##### [§](#optional-18)Optional

Enables the [hickory-dns](https://docs.rs/hickory-resolver/0.24.1/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/hickory_resolver/index.html "mod hickory_resolver") async resolver instead of a default threadpool
using `getaddrinfo`.

If the `hickory-dns` feature is turned on, the default option is enabled.

##### [§](#optional-20)Optional

This requires the optional `hickory-dns` feature to be enabled

##### [§](#warning-2)Warning

The hickory resolver does not work exactly the same, or on all the platforms
that the default resolver does

Pass an `Arc` wrapping a trait object implementing `Resolve`.
Overrides for specific names passed to `resolve` and `resolve_to_addrs` will
still be applied on top of this resolver.

                     // underneath the concurrency check, so only after concurrency limit lets us through

| I want to use the undocumented property `React.__SECRET_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED` which holds some interesting insights and can be useful in some cases.  I'm developing React libraries.   1. is it safe to use in development?    for example using  `React.__SECRET_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED.ReactCurrentOwner.current.type.displayName` I could warn the user the name of the component that consumed a custom hook without wrapping it with required context. 2. is it safe to use in production? for example [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68930011/react-accessing-internal-operation-queue-of-react)  use case.   thank you. |

| No, it’s not safe to use. That’s why it has a scary name. We offer no guarantees about what will happen if you access things there. The behavior can change on any release. We strongly recommend against touching it in your library if you don’t want that library to break later.  I could warn the user the name of the component that consumed a custom hook without wrapping it with required context.  If you use `console.error` and the user has React DevTools then they should already see the component stack in development automatically. That’s the intended solution.  is it safe to use in production? for example this use case.  No, the linked answer will most definitely break. It’s not clear to me what was the original problem that the author tried to solve, but there are almost always better ways to approach it. |

| [@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon) thank you for the response, however,   1. the solution you suggested don't show the component name in my case because the error would be raise from event and not a lifecycle event. means I save the `ReactCurrentOwner` (using useRef) and if the context is not there when the event is triggered I use it. 2. I looked at some previous releases of react and it seems like the structure of \_\_SECRET\_INTERNALS\_DO\_NOT\_USE\_OR\_YOU\_WILL\_BE\_FIRED is almost identical. 3. there some really popular libraries out there using this hook internally like [wdyr](https://github.com/welldone-software/why-did-you-render). and it doesn't look like this lib releases a patch for any single release of React. if you insist prop should be accessed, how things keeps working even on different   We offer no guarantees about what will happen if you access things there.  Why don't you provide stable API for some internal state of React itself so developers could potentially do anything they want with it (without annoyingly forking and losing any feature updates)? |

| however  You asked a question (“is it safe”), I provided a response (“it’s not”). If you choose to ignore this, it’s your decision, but we provide no guarantees. I don’t know what else to say here.  Why don't you provide stable API for some internal state of React itself so developers could potentially do anything they want with it (without annoyingly forking and losing any feature updates)?  You’re welcome to ask for specific features as a public API in separate issues that describe specific use cases. You’re welcome to file RFCs for these proposals. |

# rqbit - bittorrent client in Rust

**rqbit** is a bittorrent client written in Rust. Has HTTP API and Web UI, and can be used as a library.

Also has a desktop app built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/).

## Usage quick start

### Optional - start the server

Assuming you are downloading to ~/Downloads.

```
rqbit server start ~/Downloads

```

### Download torrents

Assuming you are downloading to ~/Downloads. If the server is already started, `-o ~/Downloads` can be omitted.

```
rqbit download -o ~/Downloads 'magnet:?....' [https?://url/to/.torrent] [/path/to/local/file.torrent]

```

## Web UI

Access with <http://localhost:3030/web/>. It looks similar to Desktop app, see screenshot below.

## Desktop app

The desktop app is a [thin wrapper](https://github.com/ikatson/rqbit/blob/main/desktop/src-tauri/src/main.rs) on top of the Web UI frontend.

Download it in [Releases](https://github.com/ikatson/rqbit/releases) for OSX and Windows. For Linux, build manually with

```
cargo tauri build

```

## Streaming support

rqbit can stream torrent files and smartly block the stream until the pieces are available. The pieces getting streamed are prioritized. All of this allows you to seek and live stream videos for example.

You can also stream to e.g. VLC or other players with HTTP URLs. Supports seeking too (through various range headers).
The streaming URLs look like <http://IP:3030/torrents/><torrent\_id>/stream/<file\_id>

## Integrated UPnP Media Server

rqbit can advertise managed torrents to LAN, e.g. your TVs and stream torrents there (without transcoding). Seeking to arbitrary points in the videos is supported too.

Usage from CLI

```
rqbit --enable-upnp-server server start ...

```

## Performance

Anecdotally from a few reports, rqbit is faster than other clients they've tried, at least with their default settings.

Memory usage for the server is usually within a few tens of megabytes, which makes it great for e.g. RaspberryPI.

CPU is spent mostly on SHA1 checksumming.

## Installation

There are pre-built binaries in [Releases](https://github.com/ikatson/rqbit/releases).
If someone wants to put rqbit into e.g. homebrew, PRs welcome :)

[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/5fc95b82887a2d854c860e8b3393698927f293b42b79e6df6684278cb0070e15/68747470733a2f2f7265706f6c6f67792e6f72672f62616467652f766572746963616c2d616c6c7265706f732f72716269742e737667)](https://repology.org/project/rqbit/versions)

If you have rust toolchain installed, this should work:

```
cargo install rqbit

```

## Docker

Docker images are published at [ikatson/rqbit](https://hub.docker.com/r/ikatson/rqbit)

## Build

Just a regular Rust binary build process.

```
cargo build --release

```

The "webui" feature requires npm installed.

## Useful options

### -v

Increase verbosity. Possible values: trace, debug, info, warn, error.

### --list

Will print the contents of the torrent file or the magnet link.

### --overwrite

If you want to resume downloading a file that already exists, you'll need to add this option.

### --peer-connect-timeout=10s

This will increase the default peer connect timeout. The default one is 2 seconds, and it's sometimes not enough.

### -r / --filename-re

Use a regex here to select files by their names.

## Features and missing features

### Some supported features

* Sequential downloading (the default and only option)
* Resume downloading file(s) if they already exist on disk
* Selective downloading using a regular expression for filename
* DHT support. Allows magnet links to work, and makes more peers available.
* HTTP API
* Pausing / unpausing / deleting (with files or not) APIs
* Stateful server
* Web UI
* Streaming, with seeking
* UPNP port forwarding to your router
* UPNP Media Server
* Fastresume (no rehashing)

## HTTP API

By default it listens on <http://127.0.0.1:3030>.

```
curl -s 'http://127.0.0.1:3030/'

{
    "apis": {
        "GET /": "list all available APIs",
        "GET /dht/stats": "DHT stats",
        "GET /dht/table": "DHT routing table",
        "GET /torrents": "List torrents (default torrent is 0)",
        "GET /torrents/{id_or_infohash}": "Torrent details",
        "GET /torrents/{id_or_infohash}/haves": "The bitfield of have pieces",
        "GET /torrents/{id_or_infohash}/peer_stats": "Per peer stats",
        "GET /torrents/{id_or_infohash}/stats/v1": "Torrent stats",
        "GET /web/": "Web UI",
        "POST /rust_log": "Set RUST_LOG to this post launch (for debugging)",
        "POST /torrents": "Add a torrent here. magnet: or http:// or a local file.",
        "POST /torrents/{id_or_infohash}/delete": "Forget about the torrent, remove the files",
        "POST /torrents/{id_or_infohash}/forget": "Forget about the torrent, keep the files",
        "POST /torrents/{id_or_infohash}/pause": "Pause torrent",
        "POST /torrents/{id_or_infohash}/start": "Resume torrent",
        "POST /torrents/{id_or_infohash}/update_only_files": "Change the selection of files to download. You need to POST json of the following form {"only_files": [0, 1, 2]}"
    },
    "server": "rqbit"
}

```

### Add torrent through HTTP API

`curl -d 'magnet:?...' http://127.0.0.1:3030/torrents`

OR

`curl -d 'http://.../file.torrent' http://127.0.0.1:3030/torrents`

OR

`curl --data-binary @/tmp/xubuntu-23.04-minimal-amd64.iso.torrent http://127.0.0.1:3030/torrents`

Supported query parameters, all optional:

* overwrite=true|false
* only\_files\_regex - the regular expression string to match filenames
* output\_folder - the folder to download to. If not specified, defaults to the one that rqbit server started with
* list\_only=true|false - if you want to just list the files in the torrent instead of downloading

## Motivation

First of all, I love Rust. This project began purely out of my enjoyment of writing code in Rust. I wasn’t satisfied with my regular BitTorrent client and wanted to see how much effort it would take to build one from scratch. Starting with the bencode protocol, then the peer protocol, it gradually evolved into what it is today.

What really drives me to keep improving rqbit is seeing genuine interest from users. For example, my dad found the CLI too difficult, so I built a desktop app just for him. Later, he got into Docker Compose and now runs rqbit on his NAS, showing how user feedback and needs can inspire new features. You can find other examples of new features born from user requests in the issues/PRs.

Hearing from people who use and appreciate rqbit keeps me motivated to continue adding new features and making it even better.

## Donations and sponsorship

If you love rqbit, please consider donating through one of these methods. With enough support, I might be able to make this my full-time job one day — which would be amazing!

## [§](#rustls---a-modern-tls-library)Rustls - a modern TLS library

Rustls is a TLS library that aims to provide a good level of cryptographic security,
requires no configuration to achieve that security, and provides no unsafe features or
obsolete cryptography by default.

Rustls implements TLS1.2 and TLS1.3 for both clients and servers. See [the full
list of protocol features](manual/_04_features/index.html "mod rustls::manual::_04_features").

#### [§](#platform-support)Platform support

While Rustls itself is platform independent, by default it uses [`aws-lc-rs`](https://crates.io/crates/aws-lc-rs) for implementing
the cryptography in TLS. See [the aws-lc-rs FAQ](https://aws.github.io/aws-lc-rs/faq.html#can-i-run-aws-lc-rs-on-x-platform-or-architecture) for more details of the
platform/architecture support constraints in aws-lc-rs.

[`ring`](https://crates.io/crates/ring) is also available via the `ring` crate feature: see
[the supported `ring` target platforms](https://github.com/briansmith/ring/blob/2e8363b433fa3b3962c877d9ed2e9145612f3160/include/ring-core/target.h#L18-L64).

By providing a custom instance of the [`crypto::CryptoProvider`](crypto/struct.CryptoProvider.html "struct rustls::crypto::CryptoProvider") struct, you
can replace all cryptography dependencies of rustls. This is a route to being portable
to a wider set of architectures and environments, or compliance requirements. See the
[`crypto::CryptoProvider`](crypto/struct.CryptoProvider.html "struct rustls::crypto::CryptoProvider") documentation for more details.

Specifying `default-features = false` when depending on rustls will remove the
dependency on aws-lc-rs.

Rustls requires Rust 1.63 or later. It has an optional dependency on zlib-rs which requires 1.75 or later.

#### [§](#cryptography-providers)Cryptography providers

Since Rustls 0.22 it has been possible to choose the provider of the cryptographic primitives
that Rustls uses. This may be appealing if you have specific platform, compliance or feature
requirements that aren’t met by the default provider, [`aws-lc-rs`](https://crates.io/crates/aws-lc-rs).

Users that wish to customize the provider in use can do so when constructing `ClientConfig`
and `ServerConfig` instances using the `with_crypto_provider` method on the respective config
builder types. See the [`crypto::CryptoProvider`](crypto/struct.CryptoProvider.html "struct rustls::crypto::CryptoProvider") documentation for more details.

##### [§](#built-in-providers)Built-in providers

Rustls ships with two built-in providers controlled with associated feature flags:

* [`aws-lc-rs`](https://crates.io/crates/aws-lc-rs) - enabled by default, available with the `aws_lc_rs` feature flag enabled.
* [`ring`](https://crates.io/crates/ring) - available with the `ring` feature flag enabled.

See the documentation for [`crypto::CryptoProvider`](crypto/struct.CryptoProvider.html "struct rustls::crypto::CryptoProvider") for details on how providers are
selected.

##### [§](#third-party-providers)Third-party providers

The community has also started developing third-party providers for Rustls:

* [`rustls-mbedtls-provider`](https://github.com/fortanix/rustls-mbedtls-provider) - a provider that uses [`mbedtls`](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls) for cryptography.
* [`rustls-openssl`](https://github.com/tofay/rustls-openssl) - a provider that uses [OpenSSL](https://openssl-library.org/) for cryptography.
* [`rustls-post-quantum`](https://crates.io/crates/rustls-post-quantum): an experimental provider that adds support for post-quantum
  key exchange to the default aws-lc-rs provider.
* [`boring-rustls-provider`](https://github.com/janrueth/boring-rustls-provider) - a work-in-progress provider that uses [`boringssl`](https://github.com/google/boringssl) for
  cryptography.
* [`rustls-rustcrypto`](https://github.com/RustCrypto/rustls-rustcrypto) - an experimental provider that uses the crypto primitives
  from [`RustCrypto`](https://github.com/RustCrypto) for cryptography.
* [`rustls-symcrypt`](https://github.com/microsoft/rustls-symcrypt) - a provider that uses Microsoft’s [SymCrypt](https://github.com/microsoft/SymCrypt) library.
* [`rustls-wolfcrypt-provider`](https://github.com/wolfSSL/rustls-wolfcrypt-provider) - a work-in-progress provider that uses [`wolfCrypt`](https://www.wolfssl.com/products/wolfcrypt) for cryptography.

##### [§](#custom-provider)Custom provider

We also provide a simple example of writing your own provider in the [`custom-provider`](https://github.com/rustls/rustls/tree/main/provider-example/)
example. This example implements a minimal provider using parts of the [`RustCrypto`](https://github.com/RustCrypto)
ecosystem.

See the [Making a custom CryptoProvider](https://docs.rs/rustls/latest/rustls/crypto/struct.CryptoProvider.html#making-a-custom-cryptoprovider) section of the documentation for more information
on this topic.

### [§](#design-overview)Design overview

Rustls is a low-level library. If your goal is to make HTTPS connections you may prefer
to use a library built on top of Rustls like [hyper](https://crates.io/crates/hyper) or [ureq](https://crates.io/crates/ureq).

#### [§](#rustls-does-not-take-care-of-network-io)Rustls does not take care of network IO

It doesn’t make or accept TCP connections, or do DNS, or read or write files.

Our [examples](https://github.com/rustls/rustls/tree/main/examples) directory contains demos that show how to handle I/O using the
[`stream::Stream`](struct.Stream.html "struct rustls::Stream") helper, as well as more complex asynchronous I/O using [`mio`](https://docs.rs/mio/latest/mio/).
If you’re already using Tokio for an async runtime you may prefer to use [`tokio-rustls`](https://github.com/rustls/tokio-rustls) instead
of interacting with rustls directly.

#### [§](#rustls-provides-encrypted-pipes)Rustls provides encrypted pipes

These are the [`ServerConnection`](server/struct.ServerConnection.html "struct rustls::server::ServerConnection") and [`ClientConnection`](client/struct.ClientConnection.html "struct rustls::client::ClientConnection") types. You supply raw TLS traffic
on the left (via the [`read_tls()`](enum.Connection.html#method.read_tls "method rustls::Connection::read_tls") and [`write_tls()`](enum.Connection.html#method.read_tls "method rustls::Connection::read_tls") methods) and then read/write the
plaintext on the right:

```
         TLS                                   Plaintext
         ===                                   =========
    read_tls()      +-----------------------+      reader() as io::Read
                    |                       |
          +--------->   ClientConnection    +--------->
                    |          or           |
          <---------+   ServerConnection    <---------+
                    |                       |
    write_tls()     +-----------------------+      writer() as io::Write
```
#### [§](#rustls-takes-care-of-server-certificate-verification)Rustls takes care of server certificate verification

You do not need to provide anything other than a set of root certificates to trust.
Certificate verification cannot be turned off or disabled in the main API.

### [§](#getting-started)Getting started

This is the minimum you need to do to make a TLS client connection.

First we load some root certificates. These are used to authenticate the server.
The simplest way is to depend on the [`webpki_roots`](https://crates.io/crates/webpki-roots) crate which contains
the Mozilla set of root certificates.

```
let root_store = rustls::RootCertStore::from_iter(
    webpki_roots::TLS_SERVER_ROOTS
        .iter()
        .cloned(),
);
```

Next, we make a `ClientConfig`. You’re likely to make one of these per process,
and use it for all connections made by that process.

```
let config = rustls::ClientConfig::builder()
    .with_root_certificates(root_store)
    .with_no_client_auth();
```

Now we can make a connection. You need to provide the server’s hostname so we
know what to expect to find in the server’s certificate.

```
let rc_config = Arc::new(config);
let example_com = "example.com".try_into().unwrap();
let mut client = rustls::ClientConnection::new(rc_config, example_com);
```

Now you should do appropriate IO for the `client` object. If `client.wants_read()` yields
true, you should call `client.read_tls()` when the underlying connection has data.
Likewise, if `client.wants_write()` yields true, you should call `client.write_tls()`
when the underlying connection is able to send data. You should continue doing this
as long as the connection is valid.

The return types of `read_tls()` and `write_tls()` only tell you if the IO worked. No
parsing or processing of the TLS messages is done. After each `read_tls()` you should
therefore call `client.process_new_packets()` which parses and processes the messages.
Any error returned from `process_new_packets` is fatal to the connection, and will tell you
why. For example, if the server’s certificate is expired `process_new_packets` will
return `Err(InvalidCertificate(Expired))`. From this point on,
`process_new_packets` will not do any new work and will return that error continually.

You can extract newly received data by calling `client.reader()` (which implements the
`io::Read` trait). You can send data to the peer by calling `client.writer()` (which
implements `io::Write` trait). Note that `client.writer().write()` buffers data you
send if the TLS connection is not yet established: this is useful for writing (say) a
HTTP request, but this is buffered so avoid large amounts of data.

The following code uses a fictional socket IO API for illustration, and does not handle
errors.

```
use std::io;
use rustls::Connection;

client.writer().write(b"GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n").unwrap();
let mut socket = connect("example.com", 443);
loop {
  if client.wants_read() && socket.ready_for_read() {
    client.read_tls(&mut socket).unwrap();
    client.process_new_packets().unwrap();

    let mut plaintext = Vec::new();
    client.reader().read_to_end(&mut plaintext).unwrap();
    io::stdout().write(&plaintext).unwrap();
  }

  if client.wants_write() && socket.ready_for_write() {
    client.write_tls(&mut socket).unwrap();
  }

  socket.wait_for_something_to_happen();
}
```
## [§](#examples)Examples

You can find several client and server examples of varying complexity in the [examples](https://github.com/rustls/rustls/tree/main/examples)
directory, including [`tlsserver-mio`](https://github.com/rustls/rustls/blob/main/examples/src/bin/tlsserver-mio.rs)
and [`tlsclient-mio`](https://github.com/rustls/rustls/blob/main/examples/src/bin/tlsclient-mio.rs)
- full worked examples using [`mio`](https://docs.rs/mio/latest/mio/).

## [§](#crate-features)Crate features

Here’s a list of what features are exposed by the rustls crate and what
they mean.

* `aws_lc_rs` (enabled by default): makes the rustls crate depend on the [`aws-lc-rs`](https://crates.io/crates/aws-lc-rs) crate.
  Use `rustls::crypto::aws_lc_rs::default_provider().install_default()` to
  use it as the default `CryptoProvider`, or provide it explicitly
  when making a `ClientConfig` or `ServerConfig`.

  Note that aws-lc-rs has additional build-time dependencies like cmake.
  See [the documentation](https://aws.github.io/aws-lc-rs/requirements/index.html) for details.
* `ring`: makes the rustls crate depend on the *ring* crate for cryptography.
  Use `rustls::crypto::ring::default_provider().install_default()` to
  use it as the default `CryptoProvider`, or provide it explicitly
  when making a `ClientConfig` or `ServerConfig`.
* `fips`: enable support for FIPS140-3-approved cryptography, via the aws-lc-rs crate.
  This feature enables the `aws_lc_rs` feature, which makes the rustls crate depend
  on [aws-lc-rs](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc-rs). It also changes the default
  for [`ServerConfig::require_ems`](server/struct.ServerConfig.html#structfield.require_ems "field rustls::server::ServerConfig::require_ems") and [`ClientConfig::require_ems`](client/struct.ClientConfig.html#structfield.require_ems "field rustls::client::ClientConfig::require_ems").

  See [manual::\_06\_fips](manual/_06_fips/index.html "mod rustls::manual::_06_fips") for more details.
* `custom-provider`: disables implicit use of built-in providers (`aws-lc-rs` or `ring`). This forces
  applications to manually install one, for instance, when using a custom `CryptoProvider`.
* `tls12` (enabled by default): enable support for TLS version 1.2. Note that, due to the
  additive nature of Cargo features and because it is enabled by default, other crates
  in your dependency graph could re-enable it for your application. If you want to disable
  TLS 1.2 for security reasons, consider explicitly enabling TLS 1.3 only in the config
  builder API.
* `logging` (enabled by default): make the rustls crate depend on the `log` crate.
  rustls outputs interesting protocol-level messages at `trace!` and `debug!` level,
  and protocol-level errors at `warn!` and `error!` level. The log messages do not
  contain secret key data, and so are safe to archive without affecting session security.
* `read_buf`: when building with Rust Nightly, adds support for the unstable
  `std::io::ReadBuf` and related APIs. This reduces costs from initializing
  buffers. Will do nothing on non-Nightly releases.
* `brotli`: uses the `brotli` crate for RFC8879 certificate compression support.
* `zlib`: uses the `zlib-rs` crate for RFC8879 certificate compression support.
