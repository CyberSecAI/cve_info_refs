- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Kings Tab Slider WordPress plugin (<= 1.0) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing injection of malicious scripts into the website.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can inject arbitrary scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website. These scripts will be executed when users visit the site, potentially leading to user compromise and other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited via malicious script injection through the plugin's input fields or parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with contributor privileges can inject the malicious script.
