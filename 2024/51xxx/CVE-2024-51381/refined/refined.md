{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated administrator.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can create new admin accounts and potentially compromise the application's integrity, confidentiality, and availability.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious HTML file containing JavaScript that triggers POST requests to create a new user and then assign it admin privileges. This HTML file is uploaded to the JATOS platform, and a link to it is sent to a logged-in administrator. When the administrator visits the link, the malicious code executes and creates the new admin account.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to upload a crafted HTML file to the JATOS platform. The attacker also needs to induce a logged-in administrator to visit a link pointing to the uploaded HTML file within the JATOS application."
