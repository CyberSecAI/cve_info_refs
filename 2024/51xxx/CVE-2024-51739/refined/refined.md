  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application's password reset functionality reveals whether a user exists or not based on the message displayed after attempting a password reset.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "User enumeration vulnerability through the password reset mechanism.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthenticated attacker can enumerate valid usernames, making it easier to perform brute-force attacks on valid accounts.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network (remote attacker).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "No privileges or user interaction required. The attacker needs network access to the application."
