- **Root cause of vulnerability**: OctoPrint versions up to and including 1.10.2 allow an attacker who has gained temporary control over an authenticated user's browser session to retrieve, recreate, or delete the user's or global API key without needing to re-authenticate by re-entering the user's account password.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control; lack of re-authentication for sensitive actions (API key manipulation) within an already authenticated session.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can use a stolen API key to access OctoPrint via its API, potentially disrupting workflows or gaining unauthorized control. The attacker can also delete API keys, disrupting workflows that depend on the key.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs temporary control over an authenticated victim's OctoPrint browser session. This could be achieved through various means like session hijacking, cross-site scripting (XSS), or physical access to the user's computer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must gain temporary control of an authenticated user's browser session. This can be achieved through methods such as session hijacking. The attacker must also be on the same network/have local access (CVSS: AV:L), require low privileges (CVSS: PR:L), and requires no user interaction (CVSS: UI:N).
