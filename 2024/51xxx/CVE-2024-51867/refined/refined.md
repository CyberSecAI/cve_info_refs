Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-51867:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Simpul Events by Esotech WordPress plugin, in versions 1.8.5 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin has an XSS vulnerability, specifically an injection vulnerability (OWASP A3).

**Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could inject malicious scripts (e.g., redirects, advertisements, other HTML payloads) into the website. These scripts would then execute when other users visit the site. This could potentially lead to unauthorized actions, data theft, or further compromise.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts, likely within a user-controllable field that is not properly sanitized before being rendered on a page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the vulnerable part of the plugin. The content implies that the user needs to have at least "contributor" privileges, though this could apply to other levels of user as well.
