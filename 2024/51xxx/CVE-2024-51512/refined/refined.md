- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the lack of parameter type verification in the WantAgent module.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation of parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect the availability of the service.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is in the WantAgent module, which could be triggered by sending specific inputs with invalid parameter types.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to be able to interact with the WantAgent module with the ability to supply input that violates type expectations.
