- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Pdf Embedder Fay plugin for WordPress, in versions 1.10.1 and below, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This is due to insufficient sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input before it's rendered in the web page, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts (such as redirects, advertisements, or other HTML payloads) into the website. When a user visits the compromised page, the injected script will execute in their browser.
- **Attack vectors:** By injecting malicious scripts via user-controlled input, which is not properly sanitized by the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to provide input to the vulnerable plugin, which can be achieved by contributing content to the WordPress site. The required privilege is at least 'Contributor'.
