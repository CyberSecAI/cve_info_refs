- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The NVMe driver queue processing in the bhyve hypervisor is vulnerable to guest-induced infinite loops.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The NVMe driver queue processing logic allows a malicious guest to manipulate the queue in a way that results in an infinite loop within the bhyve process.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious guest can trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the bhyve host by causing an infinite loop, which can render the host unresponsive.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a malicious guest VM that utilizes the vulnerable NVMe driver functionality to manipulate the queue.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have control of a guest VM running on a vulnerable bhyve hypervisor. They need to be able to interact with the NVMe device driver to send commands that will trigger the vulnerability.
