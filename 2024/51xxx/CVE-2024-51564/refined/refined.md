- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A guest can trigger an infinite loop in the hda audio driver.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The hda audio driver has a flaw that allows a guest to cause an infinite loop.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious guest virtual machine can perform a denial of service (DoS) of the bhyve host.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious guest virtual machine can trigger the infinite loop within the hda audio driver.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to control a guest virtual machine running on the vulnerable hypervisor.
