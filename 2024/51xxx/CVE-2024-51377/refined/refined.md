Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Stored HTML Injection

**Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the subject, identifier, and description fields of a Problem within the Servicedesk module.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Lack of input sanitization: The application accepts HTML code within user-controlled fields without proper encoding or sanitization.
- Stored XSS: Malicious HTML is stored in the database and executed when other users view the affected content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary script execution: An attacker can inject malicious HTML code, which may lead to actions including, but not limited to:
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Stealing session cookies
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user
    - Defacement of the application

**Attack Vectors:**
- Input fields: The vulnerable fields are within the "Problem" creation form of the Servicedesk module (subject, identifier, and description).
- Storage: The malicious HTML payload is stored in the database.
- Execution: The stored HTML is executed when a user views the problem record.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Access to the Faveo Helpdesk & Servicedesk application: The attacker needs an account to create a problem record.
- Basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript: To craft the malicious payload.

**Additional Details:**
- The report indicates the vulnerability is present in Faveo Version 9.2.0, in both the On-Premise and Cloud versions.
- The issue was reported by Asad Iqbal.
- A PDF document ([Stored.HTML-Injection.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17242536/Stored.HTML-Injection.pdf)) with details was also mentioned, but is not directly accessible from the provided context.
- The attacker injects the HTML payload into the "Problem" creation form. This payload is then executed when users view the saved "Problem" record.
