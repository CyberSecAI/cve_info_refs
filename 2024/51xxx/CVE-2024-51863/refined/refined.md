- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The PF Timer WordPress plugin, versions 1.0.0 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to an XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts into the website. These scripts can be used to redirect users, display advertisements, or execute other HTML payloads when guests visit the site.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor can inject scripts through a user-supplied input within the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to insert malicious scripts into the plugin's input fields, and requires Contributor-level privileges.
