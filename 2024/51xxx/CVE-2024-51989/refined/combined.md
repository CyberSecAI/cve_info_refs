# Cross-site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability

High

[pglombardo](/pglombardo)
published
GHSA-5chg-cq29-gfqf
Nov 7, 2024

## Package

Password Pusher Application

## Affected versions

>v1.41.1 && <=v1.48.0

## Patched versions

v1.48.1

## Description

### Summary

A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the PasswordPusher application, affecting versions `v1.41.1` through `v.1.48.0`.

The issue arises from an un-sanitized parameter which could allow attackers to inject malicious JavaScript into the application.

### Impact

Users who self-host and have the login system enabled are affected. Exploitation of this vulnerability could expose user data, access to user sessions or take unintended actions on behalf of users.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to convince a user to click a malicious account confirmation link. If exploited, data in the target user's account alone could potentially be at risk.

As of the date of this advisory, there have not been any reports of this vulnerability being exploited.

It is highly recommended to update to version `v1.48.1` or later to mitigate this risk.

### Solution

Update to version `v1.48.1` or later where input sanitization has been applied to the account confirmation process.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
