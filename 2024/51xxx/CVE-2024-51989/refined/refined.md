- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An un-sanitized parameter in the PasswordPusher application allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation could expose user data, grant access to user sessions, or allow unintended actions to be performed on behalf of users. Specifically, an attacker could potentially compromise the data within the target user's account.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a malicious account confirmation link that the attacker must convince the user to click.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to craft a malicious link and convince a user to click it. This requires some form of social engineering. The attacker does not need any special privileges, and the attack can be performed remotely over the network.
