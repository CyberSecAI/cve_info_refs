# Failure to check for packets from the broadcast address allows potential DDoS amplification attack

## Description

### Summary

The Meshtastic firmware does not check for packets claiming to be from the special broadcast address (0xFFFFFFFF) which could result in unexpected behavior and potential for DDoS attacks on the network. A malicious actor could craft a packet to be from that address which would result in an amplification of this one message into every node on the network sending multiple messages. Such an attack could result in degraded network performance for all users as the available bandwidth is consumed.

### Details

When a Meshtastic node hears from an address which has not previously been seen the standard behavior is to send a request to that node for information about it. Therefore if a node hears a message from the broadcast address, it will send a message back to the broadcast address requesting information about it. However, sending such a request to the broadcast address has special meaning in Meshtastic. Such a message is normally sent when a node first joins the network and indicates that every other node should send their node information to the sender.

Therefore a malicious actor could send one packet which results in every node which receives it requesting that every other node tell them who they are. The impact of the malicious message would also spread beyond the original number of hops because each receiving node would request to all nodes within their range. Such an attack in traditional networks could be called an amplification attack because of the exponential increase in traffic. This scenario could result in an effective DDoS which degrades the available bandwidth of the network.

The firmware does contain certain protections against amplification, such as only allowing node information to be sent every so often or not when the channel utilization is too high. However, these protections being activated would also prevent non-malicious nodes from discovering each other and degrade the overall service.

I believe the most immediate solution is to update the firmware to drop any messages coming from the broadcast address. However, I am not familiar with all of the inter workings of the firmware so there may be other potential scenarios in which the special behavior associated with the broadcast address could be exploited. It should be analyzed if any other related vulnerabilities also exist.

### PoC

The following logs demonstrates the behavior that a message is received from the broadcast address and it is treated as an unknown node which should be discovered. This node then receives from another node requesting node info because it also received the malicious message. This test was only done with a few nodes so it does not show the potential impact on a large network of nodes.

### Impact

I do not know when this behavior was introduced, but any node running firmware older than 2.5.6 is probably affected. No user interaction or privileges are required to execute such an attack. The only impact is to availability. There is no impact to scope, confidentiality, or integrity.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
