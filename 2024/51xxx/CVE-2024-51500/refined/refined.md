- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Meshtastic firmware does not properly handle packets claiming to originate from the broadcast address (0xFFFFFFFF). It treats these packets as if they came from a new node, triggering a node discovery process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Lack of input validation or filtering for packets with the broadcast address as the source.
    - Improper handling of broadcast address within the node discovery mechanism leading to amplification.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Potential for a DDoS amplification attack: A single crafted packet from the broadcast address can cause each receiving node to initiate a node discovery request, resulting in a large volume of messages and potentially saturating network bandwidth.
    - Degraded network performance for all users.
    - Could prevent legitimate nodes from discovering each other.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Maliciously crafted packets with the source address set to the broadcast address (0xFFFFFFFF).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - An attacker needs to be within radio range of the Meshtastic network.
    - No special privileges or user interaction is needed.
