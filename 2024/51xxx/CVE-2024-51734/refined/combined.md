When you try to access `/acl_users/data/clear` via HTTP without any privileges, `collections.UserDict.clear()` method is started.

This deletes all users in User Folder.

I tried to change User Folder security, but I did not change cleaning effect.

It seems that we have no restrictions on the access to the UserFolder.data attribute (PersistentMapping -> UserDict)

There are any activities to prevent this?
