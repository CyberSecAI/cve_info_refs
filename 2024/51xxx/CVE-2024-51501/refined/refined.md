{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `HttpHeaders.TryAddWithoutValidation` method, used by Refit to add headers to HTTP requests, does not check for CRLF characters in the header value.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "CRLF injection vulnerability in the `Header`, `HeaderCollection`, and `Authorize` attributes of Refit. This allows injecting arbitrary headers and smuggling HTTP requests.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject additional HTTP headers or smuggle whole HTTP requests. This can lead to request splitting and Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) if user-controlled values are passed to headers.",
  "Attack vectors": "By injecting CRLF characters into a user-controlled value that is subsequently used in a Refit header attribute (Header, HeaderCollection, or Authorize).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control or influence a value that is used to populate an HTTP header via Refit attributes. This might involve user input or manipulation of data that ends up in a header."
