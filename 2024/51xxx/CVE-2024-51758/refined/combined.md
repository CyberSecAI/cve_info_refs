Prebuilt Actions

# Export action

## [#](#overview)Overview

Filament v3.2 introduced a prebuilt action that is able to export rows to a CSV or XLSX file. When the trigger button is clicked, a modal asks for the columns that they want to export, and what they should be labeled. This feature uses [job batches](https://laravel.com/docs/queues#job-batching) and [database notifications](../../notifications/database-notifications#overview), so you need to publish those migrations from Laravel. Also, you need to publish the migrations for tables that Filament uses to store information about exports:

```
# Laravel 11 and higherphp artisan make:queue-batches-tablephp artisan make:notifications-table # Laravel 10php artisan queue:batches-tablephp artisan notifications:table# Laravel 11 and higher
php artisan make:queue-batches-table
php artisan make:notifications-table

# Laravel 10
php artisan queue:batches-table
php artisan notifications:table

```
```
# All appsphp artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-actions-migrationsphp artisan migrate# All apps
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-actions-migrations
php artisan migrate

```
> If you're using PostgreSQL, make sure that the `data` column in the notifications migration is using `json()`: `$table->json('data')`.

> If you're using UUIDs for your `User` model, make sure that your `notifiable` column in the notifications migration is using `uuidMorphs()`: `$table->uuidMorphs('notifiable')`.

You may use the `ExportAction` like so:

```
use App\Filament\Exports\ProductExporter;use Filament\Actions\ExportAction; ExportAction::make()    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)use App\Filament\Exports\ProductExporter;
use Filament\Actions\ExportAction;

ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)

```

If you want to add this action to the header of a table instead, you can use `Filament\Tables\Actions\ExportAction`:

```
use App\Filament\Exports\ProductExporter;use Filament\Tables\Actions\ExportAction;use Filament\Tables\Table; public function table(Table $table): Table{    return $table        ->headerActions([            ExportAction::make()                ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)        ]);}use App\Filament\Exports\ProductExporter;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\ExportAction;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->headerActions([
            ExportAction::make()
                ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
        ]);
}

```

Or if you want to add it as a table bulk action, so that the user can choose which rows to export, they can use `Filament\Tables\Actions\ExportBulkAction`:

```
use App\Filament\Exports\ProductExporter;use Filament\Tables\Actions\ExportBulkAction;use Filament\Tables\Table; public function table(Table $table): Table{    return $table        ->bulkActions([            ExportBulkAction::make()                ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)        ]);}use App\Filament\Exports\ProductExporter;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\ExportBulkAction;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->bulkActions([
            ExportBulkAction::make()
                ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
        ]);
}

```

The ["exporter" class needs to be created](#creating-an-exporter) to tell Filament how to export each row.

## [#](#creating-an-exporter)Creating an exporter

To create an exporter class for a model, you may use the `make:filament-exporter` command, passing the name of a model:

```
php artisan make:filament-exporter Productphp artisan make:filament-exporter Product

```

This will create a new class in the `app/Filament/Exports` directory. You now need to define the [columns](#defining-exporter-columns) that can be exported.

### [#](#automatically-generating-exporter-columns)Automatically generating exporter columns

If you'd like to save time, Filament can automatically generate the [columns](#defining-exporter-columns) for you, based on your model's database columns, using `--generate`:

```
php artisan make:filament-exporter Product --generatephp artisan make:filament-exporter Product --generate

```
## [#](#defining-exporter-columns)Defining exporter columns

To define the columns that can be exported, you need to override the `getColumns()` method on your exporter class, returning an array of `ExportColumn` objects:

```
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn; public static function getColumns(): array{    return [        ExportColumn::make('name'),        ExportColumn::make('sku')            ->label('SKU'),        ExportColumn::make('price'),    ];}use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

public static function getColumns(): array
{
    return [
        ExportColumn::make('name'),
        ExportColumn::make('sku')
            ->label('SKU'),
        ExportColumn::make('price'),
    ];
}

```
### [#](#customizing-the-label-of-an-export-column)Customizing the label of an export column

The label for each column will be generated automatically from its name, but you can override it by calling the `label()` method:

```
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn; ExportColumn::make('sku')    ->label('SKU')use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('sku')
    ->label('SKU')

```
### [#](#configuring-the-default-column-selection)Configuring the default column selection

By default, all columns will be selected when the user is asked which columns they would like to export. You can customize the default selection state for a column with the `enabledByDefault()` method:

```
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn; ExportColumn::make('description')    ->enabledByDefault(false)use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('description')
    ->enabledByDefault(false)

```
### [#](#disabling-column-selection)Disabling column selection

By default, user will be asked which columns they would like to export. You can disable this functionality using `columnMapping(false)`:

```
use App\Filament\Exports\ProductExporter; ExportAction::make()    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)    ->columnMapping(false)use App\Filament\Exports\ProductExporter;

ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
    ->columnMapping(false)

```
### [#](#calculated-export-column-state)Calculated export column state

Sometimes you need to calculate the state of a column, instead of directly reading it from a database column.

By passing a callback function to the `state()` method, you can customize the returned state for that column based on the `$record`:

```
use App\Models\Order;use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn; ExportColumn::make('amount_including_vat')    ->state(function (Order $record): float {        return $record->amount * (1 + $record->vat_rate);    })use App\Models\Order;
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('amount_including_vat')
    ->state(function (Order $record): float {
        return $record->amount * (1 + $record->vat_rate);
    })

```
### [#](#formatting-the-value-of-an-export-column)Formatting the value of an export column

You may instead pass a custom formatting callback to `formatStateUsing()`, which accepts the `$state` of the cell, and optionally the Eloquent `$record`:

```
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn; ExportColumn::make('status')    ->formatStateUsing(fn (string $state): string => __("statuses.{$state}"))use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('status')
    ->formatStateUsing(fn (string $state): string => __("statuses.{$state}"))

```

If there are [multiple values](#exporting-multiple-values-in-a-cell) in the column, the function will be called for each value.

#### [#](#limiting-text-length)Limiting text length

You may `limit()` the length of the cell's value:

```
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn; ExportColumn::make('description')    ->limit(50)use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('description')
    ->limit(50)

```
#### [#](#limiting-word-count)Limiting word count

You may limit the number of `words()` displayed in the cell:

```
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn; ExportColumn::make('description')    ->words(10)use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('description')
    ->words(10)

```
#### [#](#adding-a-prefix-or-suffix)Adding a prefix or suffix

You may add a `prefix()` or `suffix()` to the cell's value:

```
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn; ExportColumn::make('domain')    ->prefix('https://')    ->suffix('.com')use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('domain')
    ->prefix('https://')
    ->suffix('.com')

```
### [#](#exporting-multiple-values-in-a-cell)Exporting multiple values in a cell

By default, if there are multiple values in the column, they will be comma-separated. You may use the `listAsJson()` method to list them as a JSON array instead:

```
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn; ExportColumn::make('tags')    ->listAsJson()use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('tags')
    ->listAsJson()

```
### [#](#displaying-data-from-relationships)Displaying data from relationships

You may use "dot notation" to access columns within relationships. The name of the relationship comes first, followed by a period, followed by the name of the column to display:

```
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn; ExportColumn::make('author.name')use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('author.name')

```
### [#](#counting-relationships)Counting relationships

If you wish to count the number of related records in a column, you may use the `counts()` method:

```
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn; ExportColumn::make('users_count')->counts('users')use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('users_count')->counts('users')

```

In this example, `users` is the name of the relationship to count from. The name of the column must be `users_count`, as this is the convention that [Laravel uses](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-relationships#counting-related-models) for storing the result.

If you'd like to scope the relationship before calculating, you can pass an array to the method, where the key is the relationship name and the value is the function to scope the Eloquent query with:

```
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder; ExportColumn::make('users_count')->counts([    'users' => fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_active', true),])use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

ExportColumn::make('users_count')->counts([
    'users' => fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_active', true),
])

```
### [#](#determining-relationship-existence)Determining relationship existence

If you simply wish to indicate whether related records exist in a column, you may use the `exists()` method:

```
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn; ExportColumn::make('users_exists')->exists('users')use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('users_exists')->exists('users')

```

In this example, `users` is the name of the relationship to check for existence. The name of the column must be `users_exists`, as this is the convention that [Laravel uses](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-relationships#other-aggregate-functions) for storing the result.

If you'd like to scope the relationship before calculating, you can pass an array to the method, where the key is the relationship name and the value is the function to scope the Eloquent query with:

```
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder; ExportColumn::make('users_exists')->exists([    'users' => fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_active', true),])use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

ExportColumn::make('users_exists')->exists([
    'users' => fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_active', true),
])

```
### [#](#aggregating-relationships)Aggregating relationships

Filament provides several methods for aggregating a relationship field, including `avg()`, `max()`, `min()` and `sum()`. For instance, if you wish to show the average of a field on all related records in a column, you may use the `avg()` method:

```
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn; ExportColumn::make('users_avg_age')->avg('users', 'age')use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('users_avg_age')->avg('users', 'age')

```

In this example, `users` is the name of the relationship, while `age` is the field that is being averaged. The name of the column must be `users_avg_age`, as this is the convention that [Laravel uses](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-relationships#other-aggregate-functions) for storing the result.

If you'd like to scope the relationship before calculating, you can pass an array to the method, where the key is the relationship name and the value is the function to scope the Eloquent query with:

```
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder; ExportColumn::make('users_avg_age')->avg([    'users' => fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_active', true),], 'age')use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

ExportColumn::make('users_avg_age')->avg([
    'users' => fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_active', true),
], 'age')

```
## [#](#configuring-the-export-formats)Configuring the export formats

By default, the export action will allow the user to choose between both CSV and XLSX formats. You can use the `ExportFormat` enum to customize this, by passing an array of formats to the `formats()` method on the action:

```
use App\Filament\Exports\ProductExporter;use Filament\Actions\Exports\Enums\ExportFormat; ExportAction::make()    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)    ->formats([        ExportFormat::Csv,    ])    // or    ->formats([        ExportFormat::Xlsx,    ])    // or    ->formats([        ExportFormat::Xlsx,        ExportFormat::Csv,    ])use App\Filament\Exports\ProductExporter;
use Filament\Actions\Exports\Enums\ExportFormat;

ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
    ->formats([
        ExportFormat::Csv,
    ])
    // or
    ->formats([
        ExportFormat::Xlsx,
    ])
    // or
    ->formats([
        ExportFormat::Xlsx,
        ExportFormat::Csv,
    ])

```

Alternatively, you can override the `getFormats()` method on the exporter class, which will set the default formats for all actions that use that exporter:

```
use Filament\Actions\Exports\Enums\ExportFormat; public function getFormats(): array{    return [        ExportFormat::Csv,    ];}use Filament\Actions\Exports\Enums\ExportFormat;

public function getFormats(): array
{
    return [
        ExportFormat::Csv,
    ];
}

```
## [#](#modifying-the-export-query)Modifying the export query

By default, if you are using the `ExportAction` with a table, the action will use the table's currently filtered and sorted query to export the data. If you don't have a table, it will use the model's default query. To modify the query builder before exporting, you can use the `modifyQueryUsing()` method on the action:

```
use App\Filament\Exports\ProductExporter;use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder; ExportAction::make()    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)    ->modifyQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_active', true))use App\Filament\Exports\ProductExporter;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
    ->modifyQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_active', true))

```

You may inject the `$options` argument into the function, which is an array of [options](#using-export-options) for that export:

```
use App\Filament\Exports\ProductExporter;use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder; ExportAction::make()    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)    ->modifyQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query, array $options) => $query->where('is_active', $options['isActive'] ?? true))use App\Filament\Exports\ProductExporter;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
    ->modifyQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query, array $options) => $query->where('is_active', $options['isActive'] ?? true))

```

Alternatively, you can override the `modifyQuery()` method on the exporter class, which will modify the query for all actions that use that exporter:

```
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\MorphTo; public static function modifyQuery(Builder $query): Builder{    return $query->with([        'purchasable' => fn (MorphTo $morphTo) => $morphTo->morphWith([            ProductPurchase::class => ['product'],            ServicePurchase::class => ['service'],            Subscription::class => ['plan'],        ]),    ]);}use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\MorphTo;

public static function modifyQuery(Builder $query): Builder
{
    return $query->with([
        'purchasable' => fn (MorphTo $morphTo) => $morphTo->morphWith([
            ProductPurchase::class => ['product'],
            ServicePurchase::class => ['service'],
            Subscription::class => ['plan'],
        ]),
    ]);
}

```
## [#](#configuring-the-export-filesystem)Configuring the export filesystem

### [#](#customizing-the-storage-disk)Customizing the storage disk

By default, exported files will be uploaded to the storage disk defined in the [configuration file](../installation#publishing-configuration), which is `public` by default. You can set the `FILAMENT_FILESYSTEM_DISK` environment variable to change this.

While using the `public` disk a good default for many parts of Filament, using it for exports would result in exported files being stored in a public location. As such, if the default filesystem disk is `public` and a `local` disk exists in your `config/filesystems.php`, Filament will use the `local` disk for exports instead. If you override the disk to be `public` for an `ExportAction` or inside an exporter class, Filament will use that.

In production, you should use a disk such as `s3` with a private access policy, to prevent unauthorized access to the exported files.

If you want to use a different disk for a specific export, you can pass the disk name to the `disk()` method on the action:

```
ExportAction::make()    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)    ->fileDisk('s3')ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
    ->fileDisk('s3')

```

You may set the disk for all export actions at once in the `boot()` method of a service provider such as `AppServiceProvider`:

```
use Filament\Actions\ExportAction; ExportAction::configureUsing(fn (ExportAction $action) => $action->fileDisk('s3'));use Filament\Actions\ExportAction;

ExportAction::configureUsing(fn (ExportAction $action) => $action->fileDisk('s3'));

```

Alternatively, you can override the `getFileDisk()` method on the exporter class, returning the name of the disk:

```
public function getFileDisk(): string{    return 's3';}public function getFileDisk(): string
{
    return 's3';
}

```

Export files that are created are the developer's responsibility to delete if they wish. Filament does not delete these files in case the exports need to be downloaded again at a later date.

### [#](#configuring-the-export-file-names)Configuring the export file names

By default, exported files will have a name generated based on the ID and type of the export. You can also use the `fileName()` method on the action to customize the file name:

```
use Filament\Actions\Exports\Models\Export; ExportAction::make()    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)    ->fileName(fn (Export $export): string => "products-{$export->getKey()}.csv")use Filament\Actions\Exports\Models\Export;

ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
    ->fileName(fn (Export $export): string => "products-{$export->getKey()}.csv")

```

Alternatively, you can override the `getFileName()` method on the exporter class, returning a string:

```
 use Filament\Actions\Exports\Models\Export; public function getFileName(Export $export): string{    return "products-{$export->getKey()}.csv";}use Filament\Actions\Exports\Models\Export;

public function getFileName(Export $export): string
{
    return "products-{$export->getKey()}.csv";
}

```
## [#](#using-export-options)Using export options

The export action can render extra form components that the user can interact with when exporting a CSV. This can be useful to allow the user to customize the behavior of the exporter. For instance, you might want a user to be able to choose the format of specific columns when exporting. To do this, you can return options form components from the `getOptionsFormComponents()` method on your exporter class:

```
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput; public static function getOptionsFormComponents(): array{    return [        TextInput::make('descriptionLimit')            ->label('Limit the length of the description column content')            ->integer(),    ];}use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

public static function getOptionsFormComponents(): array
{
    return [
        TextInput::make('descriptionLimit')
            ->label('Limit the length of the description column content')
            ->integer(),
    ];
}

```

Alternatively, you can pass a set of static options to the exporter through the `options()` method on the action:

```
ExportAction::make()    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)    ->options([        'descriptionLimit' => 250,    ])ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
    ->options([
        'descriptionLimit' => 250,
    ])

```

Now, you can access the data from these options inside the exporter class, by injecting the `$options` argument into any closure function. For example, you might want to use it inside `formatStateUsing()` to [format a column's value](#formatting-the-value-of-an-export-column):

```
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn; ExportColumn::make('description')    ->formatStateUsing(function (string $state, array $options): string {        return (string) str($state)->limit($options['descriptionLimit'] ?? 100);    })use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('description')
    ->formatStateUsing(function (string $state, array $options): string {
        return (string) str($state)->limit($options['descriptionLimit'] ?? 100);
    })

```

Alternatively, since the `$options` argument is passed to all closure functions, you can access it inside `limit()`:

```
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn; ExportColumn::make('description')    ->limit(fn (array $options): int => $options['descriptionLimit'] ?? 100)use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('description')
    ->limit(fn (array $options): int => $options['descriptionLimit'] ?? 100)

```
## [#](#using-a-custom-user-model)Using a custom user model

By default, the `exports` table has a `user_id` column. That column is constrained to the `users` table:

```
$table->foreignId('user_id')->constrained()->cascadeOnDelete();$table->foreignId('user_id')->constrained()->cascadeOnDelete();

```

In the `Export` model, the `user()` relationship is defined as a `BelongsTo` relationship to the `App\Models\User` model. If the `App\Models\User` model does not exist, or you want to use a different one, you can bind a new `Authenticatable` model to the container in a service provider's `register()` method:

```
use App\Models\Admin;use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\Authenticatable; $this->app->bind(Authenticatable::class, Admin::class);use App\Models\Admin;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\Authenticatable;

$this->app->bind(Authenticatable::class, Admin::class);

```

If your authenticatable model uses a different table to `users`, you should pass that table name to `constrained()`:

```
$table->foreignId('user_id')->constrained('admins')->cascadeOnDelete();$table->foreignId('user_id')->constrained('admins')->cascadeOnDelete();

```
### [#](#using-a-polymorphic-user-relationship)Using a polymorphic user relationship

If you want to associate exports with multiple user models, you can use a polymorphic `MorphTo` relationship instead. To do this, you need to replace the `user_id` column in the `exports` table:

```
$table->morphs('user');$table->morphs('user');

```

Then, in a service provider's `boot()` method, you should call `Export::polymorphicUserRelationship()` to swap the `user()` relationship on the `Export` model to a `MorphTo` relationship:

```
use Filament\Actions\Exports\Models\Export; Export::polymorphicUserRelationship();use Filament\Actions\Exports\Models\Export;

Export::polymorphicUserRelationship();

```
## [#](#limiting-the-maximum-number-of-rows-that-can-be-exported)Limiting the maximum number of rows that can be exported

To prevent server overload, you may wish to limit the maximum number of rows that can be exported from one CSV file. You can do this by calling the `maxRows()` method on the action:

```
ExportAction::make()    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)    ->maxRows(100000)ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
    ->maxRows(100000)

```
## [#](#changing-the-export-chunk-size)Changing the export chunk size

Filament will chunk the CSV, and process each chunk in a different queued job. By default, chunks are 100 rows at a time. You can change this by calling the `chunkSize()` method on the action:

```
ExportAction::make()    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)    ->chunkSize(250)ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
    ->chunkSize(250)

```

If you are encountering memory or timeout issues when exporting large CSV files, you may wish to reduce the chunk size.

## [#](#changing-the-csv-delimiter)Changing the CSV delimiter

The default delimiter for CSVs is the comma (`,`). If you want to export using a different delimiter, you may override the `getCsvDelimiter()` method on the exporter class, returning a new one:

```
public static function getCsvDelimiter(): string{    return ';';}public static function getCsvDelimiter(): string
{
    return ';';
}

```

You can only specify a single character, otherwise an exception will be thrown.

## [#](#styling-xlsx-cells)Styling XLSX cells

If you want to style the cells of the XLSX file, you may override the `getXlsxCellStyle()` method on the exporter class, returning an [OpenSpout `Style` object](https://github.com/openspout/openspout/blob/4.x/docs/documentation.md#styling):

```
use OpenSpout\Common\Entity\Style\Style; public function getXlsxCellStyle(): ?Style{    return (new Style())        ->setFontSize(12)        ->setFontName('Consolas');}use OpenSpout\Common\Entity\Style\Style;

public function getXlsxCellStyle(): ?Style
{
    return (new Style())
        ->setFontSize(12)
        ->setFontName('Consolas');
}

```

If you want to use a different style for the header cells of the XLSX file only, you may override the `getXlsxHeaderCellStyle()` method on the exporter class, returning an [OpenSpout `Style` object](https://github.com/openspout/openspout/blob/4.x/docs/documentation.md#styling):

```
use OpenSpout\Common\Entity\Style\CellAlignment;use OpenSpout\Common\Entity\Style\CellVerticalAlignment;use OpenSpout\Common\Entity\Style\Color;use OpenSpout\Common\Entity\Style\Style; public function getXlsxHeaderCellStyle(): ?Style{    return (new Style())        ->setFontBold()        ->setFontItalic()        ->setFontSize(14)        ->setFontName('Consolas')        ->setFontColor(Color::rgb(255, 255, 77))        ->setBackgroundColor(Color::rgb(0, 0, 0))        ->setCellAlignment(CellAlignment::CENTER)        ->setCellVerticalAlignment(CellVerticalAlignment::CENTER);}use OpenSpout\Common\Entity\Style\CellAlignment;
use OpenSpout\Common\Entity\Style\CellVerticalAlignment;
use OpenSpout\Common\Entity\Style\Color;
use OpenSpout\Common\Entity\Style\Style;

public function getXlsxHeaderCellStyle(): ?Style
{
    return (new Style())
        ->setFontBold()
        ->setFontItalic()
        ->setFontSize(14)
        ->setFontName('Consolas')
        ->setFontColor(Color::rgb(255, 255, 77))
        ->setBackgroundColor(Color::rgb(0, 0, 0))
        ->setCellAlignment(CellAlignment::CENTER)
        ->setCellVerticalAlignment(CellVerticalAlignment::CENTER);
}

```
## [#](#customizing-the-export-job)Customizing the export job

The default job for processing exports is `Filament\Actions\Exports\Jobs\PrepareCsvExport`. If you want to extend this class and override any of its methods, you may replace the original class in the `register()` method of a service provider:

```
use App\Jobs\PrepareCsvExport;use Filament\Actions\Exports\Jobs\PrepareCsvExport as BasePrepareCsvExport; $this->app->bind(BasePrepareCsvExport::class, PrepareCsvExport::class);use App\Jobs\PrepareCsvExport;
use Filament\Actions\Exports\Jobs\PrepareCsvExport as BasePrepareCsvExport;

$this->app->bind(BasePrepareCsvExport::class, PrepareCsvExport::class);

```

Or, you can pass the new job class to the `job()` method on the action, to customize the job for a specific export:

```
use App\Jobs\PrepareCsvExport; ExportAction::make()    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)    ->job(PrepareCsvExport::class)use App\Jobs\PrepareCsvExport;

ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
    ->job(PrepareCsvExport::class)

```
### [#](#customizing-the-export-queue-and-connection)Customizing the export queue and connection

By default, the export system will use the default queue and connection. If you'd like to customize the queue used for jobs of a certain exporter, you may override the `getJobQueue()` method in your exporter class:

```
public function getJobQueue(): ?string{    return 'exports';}public function getJobQueue(): ?string
{
    return 'exports';
}

```

You can also customize the connection used for jobs of a certain exporter, by overriding the `getJobConnection()` method in your exporter class:

```
public function getJobConnection(): ?string{    return 'sqs';}public function getJobConnection(): ?string
{
    return 'sqs';
}

```
### [#](#customizing-the-export-job-middleware)Customizing the export job middleware

By default, the export system will only process one job at a time from each export. This is to prevent the server from being overloaded, and other jobs from being delayed by large exports. That functionality is defined in the `WithoutOverlapping` middleware on the exporter class:

```
public function getJobMiddleware(): array{    return [        (new WithoutOverlapping("export{$this->export->getKey()}"))->expireAfter(600),    ];}public function getJobMiddleware(): array
{
    return [
        (new WithoutOverlapping("export{$this->export->getKey()}"))->expireAfter(600),
    ];
}

```

If you'd like to customize the middleware that is applied to jobs of a certain exporter, you may override this method in your exporter class. You can read more about job middleware in the [Laravel docs](https://laravel.com/docs/queues#job-middleware).

### [#](#customizing-the-export-job-retries)Customizing the export job retries

By default, the export system will retry a job for 24 hours. This is to allow for temporary issues, such as the database being unavailable, to be resolved. That functionality is defined in the `getJobRetryUntil()` method on the exporter class:

```
use Carbon\CarbonInterface; public function getJobRetryUntil(): ?CarbonInterface{    return now()->addDay();}use Carbon\CarbonInterface;

public function getJobRetryUntil(): ?CarbonInterface
{
    return now()->addDay();
}

```

If you'd like to customize the retry time for jobs of a certain exporter, you may override this method in your exporter class. You can read more about job retries in the [Laravel docs](https://laravel.com/docs/queues#time-based-attempts).

### [#](#customizing-the-export-job-tags)Customizing the export job tags

By default, the export system will tag each job with the ID of the export. This is to allow you to easily find all jobs related to a certain export. That functionality is defined in the `getJobTags()` method on the exporter class:

```
public function getJobTags(): array{    return ["export{$this->export->getKey()}"];}public function getJobTags(): array
{
    return ["export{$this->export->getKey()}"];
}

```

If you'd like to customize the tags that are applied to jobs of a certain exporter, you may override this method in your exporter class.

### [#](#customizing-the-export-job-batch-name)Customizing the export job batch name

By default, the export system doesn't define any name for the job batches. If you'd like to customize the name that is applied to job batches of a certain exporter, you may override the `getJobBatchName()` method in your exporter class:

```
public function getJobBatchName(): ?string{    return 'product-export';}public function getJobBatchName(): ?string
{
    return 'product-export';
}

```
## [#](#authorization)Authorization

By default, only the user who started the export may download files that get generated. If you'd like to customize the authorization logic, you may create an `ExportPolicy` class, and [register it in your `AuthServiceProvider`](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/authorization#registering-policies):

```
use App\Policies\ExportPolicy;use Filament\Actions\Exports\Models\Export; protected $policies = [    Export::class => ExportPolicy::class,];use App\Policies\ExportPolicy;
use Filament\Actions\Exports\Models\Export;

protected $policies = [
    Export::class => ExportPolicy::class,
];

```

The `view()` method of the policy will be used to authorize access to the downloads.

Please note that if you define a policy, the existing logic of ensuring only the user who started the export can access it will be removed. You will need to add that logic to your policy if you want to keep it:

```
use App\Models\User;use Filament\Actions\Exports\Models\Export; public function view(User $user, Export $export): bool{    return $export->user()->is($user);}use App\Models\User;
use Filament\Actions\Exports\Models\Export;

public function view(User $user, Export $export): bool
{
    return $export->user()->is($user);
}

(PHP)

## Patched versions

>= 3.2.123

## Description

### Summary

All Filament features that interact with storage use the `default_filesystem_disk` config option. This allows the user to easily swap their storage driver to something production-ready like `s3` when deploying their app, without having to touch multiple configuration options and potentially forgetting about some.

The default disk is set to `public` when you first install Filament, since this allows users to quickly get started developing with a functional disk that allows features such as file upload previews locally without the need to set up an S3 disk with temporary URL support.

However, some features of Filament such as exports also rely on storage, and the files that are stored contain data that should often not be public. This is not an issue for the many deployed applications, since many use a secure default disk such as S3 in production. However, [CWE-1188](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1188.html) suggests that having the `public` disk as the default disk in Filament is a security vulnerability itself:

> Developers often choose default values that leave the product as open and easy to use as possible out-of-the-box, under the assumption that the administrator can (or should) change the default value. However, this ease-of-use comes at a cost when the default is insecure and the administrator does not change it.

As such, we have implemented a measure to protect users whereby if the `public` disk is set as the default disk, the exports feature will automatically swap it out for the `local` disk, if that exists. Users who set the default disk to `local` or `s3` already are not affected. If a user wants to continue to use the `public` disk for exports, they can by [setting the export disk](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/actions/prebuilt-actions/export#customizing-the-storage-disk) deliberately.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
