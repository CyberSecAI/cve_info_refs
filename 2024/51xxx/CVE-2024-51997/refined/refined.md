- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Attestation Results Token (ART), generated by the AS, can be manipulated by a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacker. Specifically, the 'jwk' field within the token's payload can be replaced with the attacker's public key. The attacker can then sign the modified ART token using their corresponding private key. The verifier, like KBS, fails to detect this replacement due to the current code implementation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Lack of proper verification of the 'jwk' field in the ART token.
    - Vulnerability to MITM attacks.
    - Inability to detect modifications to the ART token's payload, specifically the 'jwk'.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    -  Compromised integrity of the ART token, allowing arbitrary modifications to its payload without detection.
    - Potential compromise of confidentiality if the "tee-pubkey" field is used to encrypt other secrets or wrap other keys, potentially compromising secure channels between TEE/enclave and relying parties.
    - Further consequences depending on how the payload fields are used after successful authentication of the ART token.
- **Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be positioned as a MITM, capable of intercepting the ART token.
    - The attacker needs to be able to replace the 'jwk' field within the token with their own public key.
    - The attacker needs to possess the corresponding private key to sign the modified ART token.
