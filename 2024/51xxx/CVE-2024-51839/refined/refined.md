- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Utech Spinning Earth Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can inject scripts that redirect users, display advertisements, or execute arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code when a user visits the website, potentially leading to website compromise or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by injecting malicious scripts into the website, which are executed when a user visits the page where the vulnerable input is displayed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to inject the malicious script, which may require the ability to contribute content or modify data used by the plugin. The information available suggests a "Contributor" privilege level is needed.
