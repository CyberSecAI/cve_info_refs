phpMyFAQ is an open source FAQ web application. Prior to version 3.2.10, a vulnerability exists in the FAQ Record component where a privileged attacker can trigger a file download on a victim's machine upon page visit by embedding it in an <iframe> element without user interaction or explicit consent. Version 3.2.10 fixes the issue.
