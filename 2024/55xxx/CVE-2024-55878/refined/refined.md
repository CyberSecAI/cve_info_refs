Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-55878

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled input when processing specific attributes within the Excel file. Specifically, the `SimpleXLSXEx::readXfs` and `SimpleXLSX::toHTMLEx` methods do not properly sanitize data, leading to potential cross-site scripting. The commit diff highlights multiple instances where `htmlspecialchars()` was added to sanitize data extracted from the XLSX file, including font names, underline styles, fill patterns, and border styles.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is XSS, where malicious script can be injected via the Excel file and executed when the data is rendered via the `toHTMLEx` method.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The code was not properly sanitizing data read from the XLSX file, specifically when processing styles.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser.
- Potential for Malicious Actions:  This could lead to various malicious actions such as session hijacking, defacement of web pages, or stealing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted XLSX file: An attacker would need to create a specially crafted Excel file that contains malicious content within the attributes of the styling elements.
- User interaction: A victim must open or import this specially crafted Excel file via vulnerable functions, and the `toHTMLEx` method must be called to trigger the XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create a malicious XLSX file with crafted styles.
- Ability to convince a user to open/import the crafted XLSX file and render it via `toHTMLEx` method.
- The attacker does not need high privileges, a low privileged user can trigger the vulnerability if they can provide the malicious Excel file as input.
