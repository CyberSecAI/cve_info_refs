# Remote Code Execution via Unprotected Query Method

Moderate

[taylorotwell](/taylorotwell)
published
GHSA-8vwh-pr89-4mw2
Dec 13, 2024

## Package

composer

laravel/pulse
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

<1.3.1

## Patched versions

1.3.1

## Description

A vulnerability has been discovered in Laravel Pulse that could allow remote code execution through the public `remember()` method in the `Laravel\Pulse\Livewire\Concerns\RemembersQueries` trait. This method is accessible via Livewire components and can be exploited to call arbitrary callables within the application.

### Impact

An authenticated user with access to Laravel Pulse dashboard can execute arbitrary code by calling any function or static method that meets the following criteria:

* The callable is a function or static method
* The callable has no parameters or no strict parameter types

### Vulnerable Components

* The `remember(callable $query, string $key = '')` method in `Laravel\Pulse\Livewire\Concerns\RemembersQueries`
* Affects all Pulse card components that use this trait

### Attack Vectors

The vulnerability can be exploited through Livewire component interactions, for example:

```
wire:click="remember('\\Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\Config::all', 'config')"
```
### Credit

Thank you to Jeremy Angele for reporting this vulnerability.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-55661

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
