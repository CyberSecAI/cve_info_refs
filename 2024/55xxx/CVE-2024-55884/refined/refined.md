      "cve_id": "CVE-2024-55884",
      "relevance": "RELATED",
      "root_cause": "The content discusses a security audit of the Mullvad VPN application, which revealed several vulnerabilities, including a race condition and temporal safety violations in the signal handler code.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Race conditions and temporal safety violations leading to memory corruption issues in the signal handler code.",
        "Information leakage about the user's identity to network-adjacent attackers.",
        "Side channel attacks that could reveal which site a client is accessing.",
        "Insufficient signal handler stack size and usage of non-async-safe functions.",
        "Virtual IP address of the tunnel device leaking to network-adjacent participants.",
        "Deanonymization through NAT and MTU."

      ],
       "impact": "Memory corruption, information leakage, side-channel attacks leading to deanonymization.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Triggering signals via other faults to exploit signal handler code.",
        "Network-adjacent attackers can obtain information about the user's identity.",
        "Side channel attacks via network traffic analysis can reveal the accessed site.",
        "Network adjacent participants can observe the virtual IP address of the tunnel device.",
        "NAT and MTU based attacks can be used for deanonymization."
      ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to trigger a signal to exploit the signal handler code, be on the same network to obtain information about the user's identity, or be able to perform network traffic analysis for side channel attacks.",
      "additional_details": "The report mentions that while the exploitation of the signal handler code seems possible once triggered, the fact that an attacker needs to trigger a signal via another fault reduces the severity of the issue. The report also notes that the side channel attacks are mitigated in most parts except for protocol level attacks, which are not within Mullvad's control."
