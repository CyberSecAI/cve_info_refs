They lean on "DAITA" aka Defence against AI Traffic Analysis pretty heavily, which I don't fully understand yet, but is probably worth some further reading. <https://mullvad.net/en/vpn/daita> | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [ratorx](user?id=ratorx) [34 days ago](item?id=42392353)   | [parent](#42391699) | [next](#42392315) [–]  Safe signal handling has so many footguns that it seems worth re-considering the entire API. Even OpenSSH has had issues with it [1]. It seems very difficult to build good abstractions for it in any programming language, without introducing some function colouring mechanism explicitly for this. Maybe a pure language like Haskell could do it. [1]: [https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2024...](https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2024/07/01/regresshion-remote-unauthenticated-code-execution-vulnerability-in-openssh-server) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kccqzy](user?id=kccqzy) [34 days ago](item?id=42393314)   | [root](#42391699) | [parent](#42392353) | [next](#42395055) [–]  Haskell's runtime is so complex that I don't think you can write signal handling functions in Haskell. The best you can do is to mark a sigatomic boolean inside the real signal handler and arrange the runtime for check for that boolean outside the signal handler. Yup: see [https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-internal-9.1001.0/do...](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-internal-9.1001.0/docs/src/GHC.Internal.Conc.Signal.html) where it is clear that setting a handler simply writes to an array inside an MVar. And when the signal handler is run, the runtime starts a green thread to run it, which means user Haskell code does not need to worry about signal handler safe functions at all, since from the OS perspective the signal handler has returned. The user handler function simply runs as a new green thread independent of other threads. But I like the fact that you brought up this idea. Haskell can't do it but in a parallel universe if there were another language with no runtime but with monads, we can actually solve this. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nine\_k](user?id=nine_k) [33 days ago](item?id=42399415)   | [root](#42391699) | [parent](#42393314) | [next](#42395055) [–]  Why can't e.g. Rust have monads, Haskell-style? It has tailcall elimination, so endless application of functions should be doable. Monads being ergonomic is another question, but probably solvable. What am I missing? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Lvl999Noob](user?id=Lvl999Noob) [33 days ago](item?id=42399506)   | [root](#42391699) | [parent](#42399415) | [next](#42395055) [–]  I am not sure but I think rust already allows safe signal handlers? The borrow checker makes you write thread safe code even without any active threading and signals are just emergency threads with some extra limitations... right? I don't understand this too deeply so I could be wrong here. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [monocasa](user?id=monocasa) [33 days ago](item?id=42400706)   | [root](#42391699) | [parent](#42399506) | [next](#42400543) [–]  Rust does allow for safe signal handling, but it's sort of the same way that it allows for safe and correct interrupt handlers for people writing os kernels (signals are basically interrupts, just from kernel->user instead of hardware->kernel). You're basically constrained to no\_std and have to be very careful about communications with the rest of the system using lock free mechanisms. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ratorx](user?id=ratorx) [33 days ago](item?id=42400543)   | [root](#42391699) | [parent](#42399506) | [prev](#42400706) | [next](#42395055) [–]  It wouldn’t be as bad if it was that simple :) If handling a signal was equivalent to handling concurrency then it wouldn’t be as much of a problem. IIRC a signal can take over execution of a running thread, so it will completely invalidate any critical sections etc. You cannot access any shared resource easily, cannot allocate memory and a lot more restrictions of this form. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Lvl999Noob](user?id=Lvl999Noob) [33 days ago](item?id=42404206)   | [root](#42391699) | [parent](#42400543) | [next](#42395055) [–]  Yes but the signal handling code acts as if it is on a different thread. So it cannot access the critical sections or mess up any existing state on the thread anyways. Sure the other parts need to be managed manually but just that should still go a long way. ...Right? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ratorx](user?id=ratorx) [33 days ago](item?id=42404560)   | [root](#42391699) | [parent](#42404206) | [next](#42404415) [–]  Not quite, by default the signal handler hijacks an existing thread. It is possible to keep a dedicated thread around that solely waits for signals, but that’s a workaround and you end up needing to also mask all signals from all other threads for correctness. And then there are also synchronous signals, which can’t be handled this way (eg. segfaults) Imagine a scenario where the original thread state is in a critical section, in the middle of allocating memory (which may need a mutex for non-thread local allocations) etc. The code within the signal handler can’t guarantee access to any shared resource, because the previous execution of the thread may have been in the middle of the critical section. With normal concurrency, the thread that doesn’t hold the mutex can just suspend itself and wait. However, because the thread has been hijacked by the signal handler, the original critical section cannot complete until the signal has been handled, and the signal handling cannot yield to the original code because it is not suspendable. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Veserv](user?id=Veserv) [33 days ago](item?id=42404415)   | [root](#42391699) | [parent](#42404206) | [prev](#42404560) | [next](#42395055) [–]  Signal handling is distinct from a different thread because it blocks the execution of the “preempted thread” until the signal handler completes. As a example, if the preempted code grabs a lock for a resource, then signal handler completion can not depend on grabbing that lock because that lock will never be released until the preempted code runs again and the preempted code can never run again until the signal handler completes. A correct signal handler can never wait for a resource held by regular code. This precludes coordination or sharing via normal locks or critical sections. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [IgorPartola](user?id=IgorPartola) [34 days ago](item?id=42395055)   | [root](#42391699) | [parent](#42392353) | [prev](#42393314) | [next](#42394017) [–]  The best thing you can do is set a global variable value and that’s it. Let your main even loop mind the value and proceed from there. Only do this in a single thread and block singles in all others as the first thing you do. Threads and signals do not mix otherwise. Another option is to use a proper OS that includes the ability to receive signals as a part of your main event loops: <https://man.openbsd.org/kqueue.2#EVFILT_SIGNAL> I believe you can also do something similar with epoll() on Linux but not sure the semantics are quite as nice as kqueue. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [o11c](user?id=o11c) [34 days ago](item?id=42395940)   | [root](#42391699) | [parent](#42395055) | [next](#42395919) [–]  You want signalfd, which may optionally fed to epoll or any of the other multiplexing syscalls. Signalfd can mostly be implemented on any platform using a pipe (if you don't have to mix 32-bit and 64-bit processes, or if you don't need the siginfo payload, or if you read your kernel's documentation enough to figure out which "layout" of the union members is active - this is really hairy). Note however the major caveat of running out of pipe buffer. A more-reliable alternative is to use an async-signal-safe allocator (e.g. an `mmap` wrapper) to atomically store the payloads, and only use a pipe as a flag for whether there's something to look for. Of course, *none* of these mechanisms are useful for naturally synchronous signals, such as the `SIGSEGV` from dereferencing an invalid pointer, so the function-coloring approach still needs to be used. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [rstuart4133](user?id=rstuart4133) [34 days ago](item?id=42395919)   | [root](#42391699) | [parent](#42395055) | [prev](#42395940) | [next](#42398589) [–]  > Another option is to use a proper OS that includes the ability to receive signals as a part of your main event loops Every 'nix can do that. Your signal handler just writes a byte to a pipe and your main loop reads the pipe or fifo. The pipe/fifo is your event queue, which your main loop reads. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [immibis](user?id=immibis) [33 days ago](item?id=42398589)   | [root](#42391699) | [parent](#42395055) | [prev](#42395919) | [next](#42400842) [–]  on Linux you are talking about signalfd. Block all signals and then reading from a signalfd returns one pending blocked signal. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [michaelt](user?id=michaelt) [33 days ago](item?id=42400842)   | [root](#42391699) | [parent](#42395055) | [prev](#42398589) | [next](#42394017) [–]  *> The best thing you can do is set a global variable value and that’s it.* Seems kinda limiting. If I've got a slow file download going on in one thread, and my program gets a Ctrl+C signal, waiting for the download to complete before I exit ain't exactly a great user experience. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [IgorPartola](user?id=IgorPartola) [32 days ago](item?id=42408115)   | [root](#42391699) | [parent](#42400842) | [next](#42405847) [–]  Use select() or epoll() or kqueue() to see if your socket is ready for reading. That way you can monitor your global variable too. That’s the correct way to do it. If you have multiple threads, you start one just to mind signals. Signal handlers are extremely limited in what they can do, that’s the point. They are analogous to hardware interrupt handlers. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [acuozzo](user?id=acuozzo) [33 days ago](item?id=42405847)   | [root](#42391699) | [parent](#42400842) | [prev](#42408115) | [next](#42394017) [–]  Why would you not periodically check the value between calls to read() or select()? Just make sure it's non-blocking or with a relatively short timeout. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ComputerGuru](user?id=ComputerGuru) [34 days ago](item?id=42394017)   | [root](#42391699) | [parent](#42392353) | [prev](#42395055) | [next](#42392923) [–]  In fish-shell we have to forego using the niceties of the rust standard library and make very carefully measured calls to libc posix functions directly, with extra care taken to make sure so memory used (eg for formatting errors or strings) was allocated beforehand. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jandrese](user?id=jandrese) [34 days ago](item?id=42392923)   | [root](#42391699) | [parent](#42392353) | [prev](#42394017) | [next](#42392315) [–]  Or it's nearly impossible for a pure functional language if the result of the async signal means you need to mutate some state elsewhere in the program to deal with the issue. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ratorx](user?id=ratorx) [34 days ago](item?id=42393018)   | [root](#42391699) | [parent](#42392923) | [next](#42392315) [–]  I think that’s slightly orthogonal. It would still be safe, because you’d design around this restriction from the start, rather than accidentally call or mutate something you were not supposed to. The problem with safe signal handling is that you need to verify that your entire signal handler call stack is async safe. Assuming purity is a stronger property, signal handling is a safe API without any more work. The inflexibility due to the purity might cause other issues but that’s more a language level concern. If the signal handling API is safe and inflexible, it still seems better for a lot of use cases than an unsafe by default one. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [o11c](user?id=o11c) [34 days ago](item?id=42395792)   | [root](#42391699) | [parent](#42393018) | [next](#42392315) [–]  The real problem is that the compiler doesn't provide arbitrary function-colorings, only the a handful of builtins: `pure`, `const`, `noreturn`. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [s-zeng](user?id=s-zeng) [33 days ago](item?id=42397855)   | [root](#42391699) | [parent](#42395792) | [next](#42392315) [–]  Monads can be thought of as arbitrary function colourings, hence the prior mention of Haskell potentially being a good fit. Of course monads are implementable in almost any other language, but few have as much syntax sugar or general library support as Haskell does, except maybe Ocaml | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jandrese](user?id=jandrese) [33 days ago](item?id=42399157)   | [root](#42391699) | [parent](#42397855) | [next](#42392315) [–]  Yeah, but how do you design a Monad that does the "tell this other thread to unblock and unwind its state because an external error has triggered?

Even without a signal handler, if you want to write an application which handles async input, you have to handle the case of processing the input to do something useful (eg. let’s say you are writing an HTTP server and want to have a network endpoint for safely killing the thing). I think the generally recommended way to represent 2) in a pure way is to model the signal as a state machine input and handle it like all other communication. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [daghamm](user?id=daghamm) [34 days ago](item?id=42392315)   | [parent](#42391699) | [prev](#42392353) | [next](#42400677) [–]  I think the paper is easier to follow <https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3603216.3624953> | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [barbegal](user?id=barbegal) [33 days ago](item?id=42400677)   | [parent](#42391699) | [prev](#42392315) | [next](#42394408) [–]  Stack too small - there's no proof the 8k allocated is too small, is it really exploitable? Non async functions - pretty common problem but difficult to actually exploit. Every developer who has worked with signal handlers has probably made this mistake at some point because the issues it causes are extremely difficult to reproduce (some incredibly unlucky timing is required) Arp leaking addresses - Not really a Mullvad issue and only exploitable on the local network Deanonymization attacks - these work against all VPNs and you can always anonymize traffic more but it has a cost to do this. Sideloading - Yeah this is probably the worst one but is not exploitable on it's own. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tptacek](user?id=tptacek) [34 days ago](item?id=42394408)   | [prev](#42391699) | [next](#42392906) [–]  I was going to go on a little rant about public audit reports that say stuff like "this company is very secure and is doing things great and this audit confirms that" --- not at all an x41-specific complaint, virtually all assessment firms are guilty of it, some much more than x41. But: they found a triggerable heap corruption vulnerability in a Rust program, which is a nice catch.

The dedicated threat model section is something that a lot of auditing outfits skip over in their reports.

On top of that there is a reasonable limit in terms of time/money/staff/resources that can be spent on these kinds of audits, etc. For example, if you're using a cloud provider it's not like you're going to pay them infinity money to compromise GCP over the course of 9 months through a background operator compromise or some nation-state attack. You're not going to pay them to spend all day finding 0days in OpenSSL when your business runs a Django app. You're going to set baseline rules like "You need to compromise our account under some approaches, like social engineering of our own employees, or elevating privileges by attacking the software and pivoting." It's mostly just a matter of having a defined scope. They could of course say "You can only attack this one exact thing" that makes them look good, but this is true of many things. Defining the threat model is standard in the infosec auditing/pentest world, FWIW. > If Mullvad dictated how to do things or imposed limits on the reach of the testing, the results are worthless anyway That's only true if your threat model is "literally every possible thing that could ever happen", which is so broad to be meaningless and impossible to test anyway. Computer programmers also do not typically design their programs under the assumption that someone stuffed newspaper between their CPU and heatsink and it caught on fire. They work on the assumption the computer is not on fire. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [palata](user?id=palata) [34 days ago](item?id=42393299)   | [root](#42392906) | [parent](#42393217) | [prev](#42393417) | [next](#42393395) [–]  Say I manufacture door locks, and I ask you to audit the security of my system. Wouldn't it make sense to agree with you that stuff like lockpicking is fine, but going around the building, breaking a window and entering the room doesn't count as "breaking the lock security"?

In which case, having the threat model detailed explicitly is already valuable to you. For example, this X41's threat model only supposes that an attacker could execute code on the system as a different, unprivileged user. They don't consider the situation where an attacker might have an administrative account on the system. For my personal devices today, this matches my threat model. If an attacker has an administrative account on my machine, I assume that my VPN isn't going to be able to protect my traffic from them. There's no need to worry about laying out all the ways this could impact Mullvad's client. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [dsp\_person](user?id=dsp_person) [33 days ago](item?id=42401654)   | [root](#42392906) | [parent](#42393217) | [prev](#42393395) | [next](#42397287) [–]  An example where auditors not having the threat model did not help the audit: <https://defuse.ca/audits/gocryptfs.htm> > We believe the reason these vulnerabilities exist is because gocryptfs doesn’t have a clearly spelled-out threat model.

If I ask a person to do a audit I will tell them what the scope of their audit is, e.g. check the physical security measures of our server rooms. Otherwise they would have to take literally everything into consideration (what if the accountant is a malicous actor, what if the server rooms are attacked by a military, what if our hardware is swapped out during delivery, what if..) and they would never be able to stop.

That is how audits work. In security, that will typically be a standard (or set of standards) alongside a threat model. In finances, you audit against what is legal in the areas you operate. >*[...] zero idea what the auditor would be doing?* That's a practical impossibility. From the client side you want to be able to evaluate quotes, stay within a budget, etc. You don't want to pay good money (audits are really expensive!) for areas that you are works-in-progress, or non-applicable threat models (e.g. lots of security software explicitly does not protect against nation-state actors, so they don't do audits from the perspective of a nation-state actor). From the auditor side, you want to know what staff to assign (according to their expertise), how to schedule your staff, etc. >*If Mullvad dictated how to do things or imposed limits on the reach of the testing, the results are worthless anyway* Not at all. The company says "This is the set of standards we are auditing against and our threat model. This is how we performed". The results are useful for everything covered by those standards and threat model. By explicitly stating the threat model, you as a consumer can compare your threat model to the one that was audited and make an informed decision. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ylk](user?id=ylk) [34 days ago](item?id=42390787)   | [prev](#42392906) | [next](#42391301) [–]  Link to Mullvad's blog post: [https://mullvad.net/en/blog/the-report-for-the-2024-security...](https://mullvad.net/en/blog/the-report-for-the-2024-security-audit-of-the-app-is-now-available) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [LeoPanthera](user?id=LeoPanthera) [34 days ago](item?id=42391301)   | [prev](#42390787) | [next](#42394551) [–]  The Mullvad VPN *app*.

Movies and series don't exist if they're not on Netflix (or your chosen streaming platform).

There are no central repositories as to the location of arbitrary banknote serial numbers. Lets assume, for the sake of argument, that a cash-paying user were to make the mistake of paying every single time to renew the same suspicious Mullvad account using cash which was *always* newly withdrawn from cash machines from a banking institution which meticulously tracks them and is able to report from which location they originated (maybe even the card which withdrew them!). In that case, if Mullvad were to be compromised (or if the targeted user was such an absolute threat to humankind that Mullvad were to agree to collaborate in his or her capture), it would only be possible if Mullvad's mail receivers were to either *a)* actively keep track of either banknote serial number and link it to a customer, or *b)* be fully aware of the requirement to make a note of it only of received to renew the target account. Anything short of that and even the perfectly traceable banknote serial number just becomes one of hundreds? thousands? deposited by Mullvad in their bank accounts — assuming they don't even use some of them as petty cash if needed. If a user of Mullvad were to reach that level of a threat model I would argue they would be much more likely to be caught by tracking of their sent mail, in the style of Ted Kaczyński. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [mmooss](user?id=mmooss) [33 days ago](item?id=42403921)   | [root](#42392976) | [parent](#42399287) | [next](#42398351) [–]  > There are no central repositories as to the location of arbitrary banknote serial numbers. Why do you say that? All that's needed is banks tracking serial numbers and associated persons as cash leaves the bank and enters it. The serial numbers on American cash seem machine readable, and on each bill they are printed in two places near opposite corners - as if they are designed for automated reading. It doesn't have to be perfect, logically infallible, alibi-proof evidence.

I'm not trying to hide the fact that I occasionally use a VPN. The ISP sees the tunnel, the websites I visit see the VPN IP, netflow logs the time, duration, bytes transferred, etc. It's no secret that I am using a VPN. IMO, most VPN users are normal people, like me, who just want privacy from online advertisers and data aggregators. I do not want or expect privacy from the VPN provider. After all, I connect to their VPN service from my home ISP (which has an IP) that has an account in my name too. No matter how you try to hide your payment for the VPN service, they know who you are. IMO, technical people often 'go too far' and become unreasonable about these things (especially security people). They have lost touch with real-world threat models and use cases.

By connecting via Tor, they don't know what you're connecting to, and if they go through the trouble of attacking Tor for you, they'll still land at Mullvad and they probably have to get a warrant for them to start keeping logs on all Tor users until they eventually can tie activities to an ISP subscriber So I can see the reasoning, though anyone who considers this: I've heard years ago that they're not sure whether VPN-in-Tor or vice versa improves or degrades the anonymity, there are apparently reasons for either way, please read up on it before you feel safe using whatever solution in a regime without freedom of speech or something | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nexoft](user?id=nexoft) [34 days ago](item?id=42393808)   | [root](#42392976) | [parent](#42393737) | [prev](#42394766) | [next](#42405594) [–]  not if he is using his neighors maybe he is using tor on top of it who knows | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [btmiller](user?id=btmiller) [34 days ago](item?id=42393895)   | [root](#42392976) | [parent](#42393808) | [next](#42405594) [–]  I’ve never understood the neighbor approach.

The implementation will be super simple. Set up your local IP address or IP address range (if you are on a dynamic IP address connection). Consistently call 'ipinfo.io/ip' every 5 seconds to check if the IP address is changing from your home IP address. You will get an alert if the IP address changes. So, when you turn on your VPN, this notification should alert you that your IP address has changed. I would recommend using the 'ipinfo.io/ip' with a public IP address-based implementation as you can get a virtually infinite amount of queries. With just an 'ipinfo.io' query which gets you the location information as well, you get 1,000 queries without a token. This could work if you reduce the API call rate to a higher interval (not at a second level but only at a minute-level interval). But you do get the location information, which validates the VPN's location information. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bjoli](user?id=bjoli) [33 days ago](item?id=42397677)   | [parent](#42397298) | [prev](#42399030) | [next](#42396690) [–]  I am a happy mullvad customer since about 5 years.

I am pretty convinced the aggressive blocking is not because of abuse, but because VPNs *actually* have become a problem for tracking and data mining. I have the suspicion the IP blocking is somewhat coordinated between Youtube and Reddit, to maximize annoyance and discourage VPN usage, since I frequently find exit server working for either one of them, but not both. Disrupting the ping pong of social media for VPN users, seems like an effective strategy to influence their behavior. And since they are natural monopolies respectively, they hardly risk alienating anyone doing so. Similar to how cookie banners are abused to modify people's sentiment on privacy regulations in favor of data mining. Even many tech people believe annoying cookie banners are the EU's fault, when common practice is either malicious compliance, unwarranted or straight illegal. That said, it *is* actually fucking annoying. Then again, just a nuance in the greater enshittification and rapidly growing dissatisfaction with the web overall for me. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [shiroiushi](user?id=shiroiushi) [33 days ago](item?id=42405236)   | [root](#42396690) | [parent](#42399985) | [next](#42397377) [–]  >Youtube and Reddit are the worst.

So if the tunnel over SSH technique is common, and they detect a SSH connection that behaves in a specific way, for example because of fixed-size handshake packets, they can guess it is tunneling a VPN. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [meowfly](user?id=meowfly) [33 days ago](item?id=42399463)   | [root](#42393230) | [parent](#42399053) | [next](#42396784) [–]  That was my experience. When I was in China I would use my own VPN using ec2 and the now defunct Streisand (which uses stunnel). First few requests were always fast but as you use more bandwidth your requests would start to slow down considerably. Oddly a foreign sim gets uncensored internet, so that's what I've recommended to travelers, but haven't been back since COVID so that might be outdated info. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [EVa5I7bHFq9mnYK](user?id=EVa5I7bHFq9mnYK) [34 days ago](item?id=42396784)   | [root](#42393230) | [parent](#42396658) | [prev](#42399053) | [next](#42393323) [–]  do you mean, xray to a vps and install mullvad on that vps?

They stated that they see specifically a lot of Mullvad ads. Not general VPN ads. That is what makes is sound malicious. Mullvad is not even close to being in the group of biggest marketing spenders. You need a minute on their website to see that they have a very simple approach to funding their business. No "life time subscription" exclusive offers, no BS privacy claims... Also this is HN, not a comment section on something like Yahoo news, really hard to consider people commenting here as being detached from tech trends and news. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [shiroiushi](user?id=shiroiushi) [33 days ago](item?id=42405282)   | [root](#42393230) | [parent](#42397395) | [next](#42397414) [–]  >They stated that they see specifically a lot of Mullvad ads. Not general VPN ads. I've only seen VPN ads from one company actually plastered in metro stations and inside subway cars: Mullvad. I've never seen physical ads for any other VPN provider. I've seen lots of horribly annoying ads (or "sponsor segments") from various other VPNs, and I'm sure I've blocked orders of magnitude more of them by using SponsorBlock. But for real, in-person ads? Only Mullvad. I'm not criticizing Mullvad here. In fact, this is probably a smart strategy on their part: if you're too clueless to use an ad-blocker online, you're not going to see other VPN providers' ads very much. But if you're highly privacy-focused, you'll already be using an ad-blocker and probably SponsorBlock too if you watch YouTube videos, so you really won't see other companies online ads much. But you can't miss physical ads on your subway ride. Their ads are also cute and clever, pointing out that a piece of paper stuck to the wall isn't tracking you the way most internet advertising does. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [defrost](user?id=defrost) [33 days ago](item?id=42397414)   | [root](#42393230) | [parent](#42397395) | [prev](#42405282) | [next](#42414046) [–]  Mullvad has a small number of well targeted ads in my experience. If the person above frequents certain torrent trackers, reads *Torrent Freak*, or travels in other small VPN adjacent circles then it's no stretch to imagine they have seen Mullvad mentioned a great deal, both through ads and through unsponsered forum members ranking Mullvad high on their HOWTO safely do {X} guides. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [piaste](user?id=piaste) [33 days ago](item?id=42397596)   | [root](#42393230) | [parent](#42397414) | [next](#42414046) [–]  Surprising!

Easy of software, number of countries, GFC, circumvent geoblocking, it is one of the best, if not the best, but it comes with a big price tag attached. I think 300 USD/2 years if I remember correctly. If you don't need the best, AirVPN has often deals for 50USD/2 years. But the servers are very "spammy" (tons of captchas for you to solve). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Black616Angel](user?id=Black616Angel) [33 days ago](item?id=42398697)   | [parent](#42398343) | [next](#42398479) [–]  Please don't give recommendations. Mullvad has had multiple public audits and even contributed to other security-related open source projects. You don't have to create an account and they even take cash by mail. It can't be more anonymous than that. Astrill on the other hand has had no public audits, and costs more than twice as much. It is not worth the price, since their security can't be checked by normal users. Also they require an account. Furthermore even in their FAQ they don't say that they wouldn't give the data to a court. They ask the question, but don't really answer it. I would never buy a VPN from a company like that. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Beijinger](user?id=Beijinger) [33 days ago](item?id=42401680)   | [root](#42398343) | [parent](#42398697) | [next](#42398479) [–]  Please don't give judgements if you dont have an idea what are you talking about. Just use the best programming language. Ups? For what application? Yes, everything depends on the application. Honestly, I doubt that many VPNs are better then Astrill if it comes to the GFC. I mentioned, it comes at a price. But if you are price sensitive, Mullvad is still nearly double the price of AirVPN.... "Mullvad has had multiple public audits and even contributed to other security-related open source projects." Well, airvpn has also interesting roots. <https://airvpn.org/aboutus/> "You don't have to create an account, and they even take cash by mail. It can't be more" Well, I dont think any of my recommendations takes cash by mail, but that may take bitcoin. And for the applications you are hinting at, it is much more important that you connect via Tor to your VPN. One thing gives anonymity, the other privacy. "Furthermore even in their FAQ they don't say that they wouldn't give the data to a court." ROTFL. Every company will give data, or the data they have, to a court. At least in their own jurisdiction. Yet, there are (or were) VPNs that were cyberspace only. No corporation, just a website. A business that is not incorporated and only exits in cyberspace may indeed have a lot of leverage. At this point, you may ask yourself what you are doing. But if it is really so important, I would start setting up my own servers and selling my own VPNs. A tree you can hide best in a Forrest. "I would never buy a VPN from a company like that." If everything you have is a hammer, every problem becomes a nail. Everything depends on your application and what you want to achieve. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [phartenfeller](user?id=phartenfeller) [33 days ago](item?id=42398479)   | [parent](#42398343) | [prev](#42398697) | [next](#42407420) [–]  Why do you think Astrill is one of the best?

Works reliable in China, is often NOT detected as a VPN (geo-blocking, Banks, captchas). They even offer fixed IP addresses, if desired. If you ask why would you have a fixed ip address and if this does not contradict the idea of a VPN you may have little international experience and don't understand the different applications of a VPN. Hey, there may be people that give a f... about the privacy it offers because they have totally different applications. If you want a Mercedes of VPNs, likely Astrill is the choice. If privacy is your main concern, there are many options. Dont mistake privacy for anonymity. If in doubt, pay with Bitcoin and use TOR to connect to your VPN. For my current application, AirVPN is more than enough. Two years: are 79 €, if they have a special, it is 49 euro. If you are cost sensitive, Mullvad is double the price already, but at least only less than half of the Astrill price. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [akimbostrawman](user?id=akimbostrawman) [32 days ago](item?id=42406877)   | [root](#42398343) | [parent](#42401745) | [next](#42407420) [–]  >If privacy is your main concern, there are many options.

# Review of Mullvad VPN

X41 performed a white box penetration test with source code access against the [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net) VPN Application. The efforts included formulating a light threat model.

The targets of this test were challenging for the team because of its size, the fact that they run on five different platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS), and the regular audits performed by Mullvad VPN. The fact that new vulnerabilities were found in existing code shows that the efforts taken regularly by Mullvad are justified and appropriate for product of such complexity.

It also shows that in mature targets the findings tend to move into domains not under direct control or in direct focus of the application development as can be seen in the findings rooting from specifics of the operating systemâs behavior or the interplay of different network layers and protocols.

This is what keeps security audits and tests of mature and hard targets interesting for the team at X41 as well.

## Results

A total of six vulnerabilities were discovered during the test by X41.

Overall, the Mullvad VPN Applications appear to have a high security level and are well positioned to protect from the threat model proposed in our report. The use of safe coding and design patterns in combination with regular audits and penetration tests led to a very hardened environment.

The most serious vulnerabilities are considered to be race conditions and temporal safety violations leading to memory corruption issues in the signal handler code. While exploitation of the signal handler code once triggered seems not unlikely, the fact that an attacker first needs to trigger a signal via another fault reduces the severity of the issues. Other vulnerabilities allow leaking information about the identity of a user by network adjacent attackers and to perform side channel attacks that could in specific circumstances reveal which site a client is currently accessing.

The aspect of side channel attacks is mitigated in most parts, except for protocol level attacks that are not within the control of Mullvad VPN AB because they root from a combination of different technologies such as NAT and modern variants of the HTTP protocol. The introduction of obfuscation technologies and proxy services within the protected VPN is an option for users with higher security and privacy demands.

In conclusion, the client applications exposed a limited number of relevant vulnerabilities. Mullvad VPN AB addressed them swiftly and the fixes were audited to be working properly.

X41 would like to thank Mullvad VPN AB for the nice collaboration and smooth communication throughout the audit!
