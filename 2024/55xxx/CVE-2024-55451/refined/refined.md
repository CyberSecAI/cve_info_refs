Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-55451

**Description:** The provided content includes a detailed write-up for a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in UJCMS version 9.6.3.

**Root Cause:**
* The application does not properly sanitize SVG file contents, particularly attributes like `onload`, allowing the execution of embedded JavaScript.
* Sensitive cookies, such as `jwt-access-token`, lack the `HttpOnly` flag, making them accessible to JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Stored XSS (CWE-79):** Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the application through SVG file uploads and executed in the context of other users' browsers.
* **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The absence of the `HttpOnly` flag on sensitive cookies allows JavaScript to access and potentially exfiltrate them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser when they view a malicious SVG file.
* **JWT Theft:** Sensitive tokens, such as `jwt-access-token`, can be stolen by malicious JavaScript code, enabling attackers to impersonate victims and gain unauthorized access to their accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **File Upload:** Attackers upload a maliciously crafted SVG file via the `/cp/#/file/web-file-upload/` endpoint.
* **Viewing Malicious Content:** Other authenticated backend users trigger the vulnerability when viewing the uploaded malicious SVG file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated backend user to upload the malicious SVG file.
* **Knowledge of Target:** The attacker needs to know the target application uses a file upload feature, and be aware of the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
* The vulnerability is specifically located in the SVG file upload functionality of UJCMS 9.6.3.
* The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) SVG file uses the `onload` attribute to execute JavaScript that fetches and exfiltrates the `document.cookie` to an attacker-controlled server.
* The attack leverages the lack of sanitization of the SVG file, specifically the `onload` attribute.

**Mitigation Recommendations:**
* **SVG File Sanitization:** Use a robust library like DOMPurify to sanitize SVG files during upload to remove or escape malicious attributes.
* **Secure Cookie Attributes:** Set the `HttpOnly` flag on sensitive cookies to prevent JavaScript access, and the `Secure` flag to restrict cookies to HTTPS connections.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a CSP to limit the execution of inline JavaScript.
* **Strict Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all inputs, especially for file uploads.
* **Restrict SVG Rendering:** Disable direct rendering of uploaded SVGs and convert them to safer formats before displaying.
* **Token Revocation and Rotation:** Regularly rotate sensitive tokens and implement revocation mechanisms.

This vulnerability allows for a Stored XSS attack, leading to potential JWT theft through maliciously crafted SVG file uploads, which impacts backend users of the UJCMS application. The lack of sanitization, and insecure cookie handling are the main contributing factors.
