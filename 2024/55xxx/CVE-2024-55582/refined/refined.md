- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ZFS datasets containing the Oxide Control Plane datastores (CockroachDB, ClickHouse, Crucible file systems) were not configured with encryption prior to version 6 of the Oxide software. This was due to incorrect placement of the persistent datasets outside of the encrypted hierarchy in the ZFS file system.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unencrypted ZFS datasets containing sensitive control plane data. This includes the CockroachDB database containing user device tokens, rack configurations, VM instance and disk metadata, and the encryption keys for virtual disks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with physical access to the Oxide Rack can remove disks, access the unencrypted datasets, and potentially:
    - Steal user device tokens and impersonate users to access their VM instances.
    - Decrypt virtual disk data using the retrieved encryption keys.
    - View and modify system data.
    - Gain unauthorized access to VM instances and sensitive data stored on disks.
- **Attack vectors:** Physical access to the Oxide Rack and removal of physical disks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Physical access to the Oxide Rack.
    - Knowledge of the location and structure of the control plane databases.
    - Ability to parse the raw data of the CockroachDB datasets.
