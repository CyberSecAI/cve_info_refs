- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it on the `/user/certificate-form.php` page, leading to a stored HTML Injection vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored HTML Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary HTML code on the client-side. This can result in data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker injects malicious HTML code into the `Full Name` parameter of the `/user/certificate-form.php` page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application.
