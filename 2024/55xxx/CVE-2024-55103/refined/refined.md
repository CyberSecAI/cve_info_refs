  "cve": "CVE-2024-55103",
  "extracted_info": {
    "summary": "Online Nurse Hiring System V1.0 is susceptible to SQL injection due to insufficient protection on the 'fullname' parameter in the profile.php file, potentially leading to unauthorized database access and sensitive information extraction.",
    "root_cause": "Lack of proper input validation and sanitization on the 'fullname' parameter in the profile.php file.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthorized access and extraction of sensitive information from the database.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the vulnerable `/admin/profile.php` endpoint with a malicious SQL query injected into the `fullname` parameter"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server. No authentication is required as the vulnerability allows for bypassing authentication mechanisms.",
        "additional_details": "The PoC utilizes `sqlmap` to identify and exploit the SQL injection vulnerability. The provided HTTP request shows how a time-based blind SQL injection can be triggered by crafting a malicious payload in the `fullname` field of a POST request to `/admin/profile.php`"
