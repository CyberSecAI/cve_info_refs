# Security Advisory - IXSA-20241204-01

| Advisory ID | IXSA-20241204-01 |
| --- | --- |
| Version | 1.1 |
| Last updated | 17.12.2024 |
| Published | 04.12.2024 |
| Status | Resolved |
| CVEs | CVE-2024-55554 |
| Summary | User-defined porlets on portal pages are susceptible to the execution of Java Script code in HTML (âCross-Site-Scriptingâ). |
| Type/Severity | High |
| Description | On Intrexx portal pages, portlets of the type âUser-definedâ can be created with user-defined HTML input. Java script code inserted in this portlet can be executed unnoticed in the portal when the portlet is output in the same or another user context and can lead to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. With Intrexx version 12.0.2, this vulnerability will be closed. With this release, three configuration options are available in the portal properties to influence the behavior of the output of the user-defined portlet and thus secure it. |
| Solution | Please install Intrexx version 12.0.2 and check the new configuration options in the portal properties under âSecurityâ immediately after completing the update. |
| Affected Products | * Intrexx Portal Server <= 12.0.1 |
| Fixes | * Intrexx Version 12.0.2 (12.0.2.20241204.1), Released on 04.12.2024 |
| References | * Changelog: <https://help.intrexx.com/intrexx/steady/de-de/Content/OH/news-changelogs-steady.html> |
