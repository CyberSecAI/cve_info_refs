- **Root cause of vulnerability**: User-defined portlets on portal pages allow user-defined HTML input, which can be exploited to inject and execute JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Malicious JavaScript code can be executed in the context of other users, leading to potential unauthorized actions or data breaches.
- **Attack vectors**: By creating a "User-defined" portlet with malicious JavaScript code within the HTML input.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Ability to create user-defined portlets within the Intrexx portal.
