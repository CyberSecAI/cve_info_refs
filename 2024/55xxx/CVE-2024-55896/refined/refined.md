- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The PowerHA Web Interface is vulnerable to hijacking the clicking action of users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows for the hijacking of user's clicking actions. This is likely a clickjacking or UI redressing vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially manipulate a user's clicks on the PowerHA Web Interface, leading to unintended actions or data modification.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is likely conducted through a malicious website or content embedding the vulnerable PowerHA Web Interface in an iframe or similar technique, tricking the user into clicking on elements controlled by the attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to lure the victim to a malicious site or deliver malicious content that includes the vulnerable web interface, or leverage an existing vulnerability to inject malicious content. The attacker must understand how the PowerHA Web Interface is structured to effectively manipulate user clicks.
