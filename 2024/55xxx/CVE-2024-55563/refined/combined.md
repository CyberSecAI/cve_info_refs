=== Content from ariard.github.io_b4f4a454_20250114_203326.html ===
This report is to disclose a new transaction-relay jamming attack

affecting bitcoin time-sensitive contracting protocols by exploiting the transaction

selection, announcement and propagation mechanisms of base-layer full-nodes.

Back in 2020, amid numerous technical conversations among bitcoin protocol developers

about how bip125 replace-by-fee rules could be abused by a lightning channel counterparty

with a competing interest (a.k.a pinning attack, see BIP431's motivation for more), it

was thought that few other components of the bitcoin tx-relay p2p stack could be also

adversarially exploited [0] (In the lack of familiarity with lightning / contracting

protocol security risks, go to read the old post pointed by footnote).

Mid-2023, I did privately message a group of long-term bitcoin and lightning

developers detailing those new "transaction-relay throughput attacks" concerns,

especially the different exploitations and the technical feasibility of such attack.

While this attack was deemed worthy of more investigations and practical testing, it

was relatively put in the background due to more severe security issues affecting

lightning at the time (i.e 2023). Recent conversations this year (i.e 2024) about

free relay attacks of full-node bandwidths made me think to reconsider the practical

cost of transaction-relay throughput attacks, and as such proceeds to a full disclosure.

Since my personal awareness in 2020 of this potential vector of attack enabling to

steal funds from lightning channel funds, I've not seen exploitations in the wild or

corresponding hints that could reveal such new transaction-relay jamming attack

being practically used.

In this report, 2 variations of those new "transaction-relay throughput attacks"

are presented, i.e respectively the "high overflow" and the "low overflow" variant.

There is a proof-of-concept available for the "high overflow" variation tested on

bitcoin core v27.0. The "high overflow" variation has been tested under few topological

configurations, though no under real-world workload. Coming with a proof-of-concept

to demonstrate the feasibility of the 2nd variation stays an open subject of investigation.

(see corresponding subsection for more).

After conversation with few lightning maintainers, it arises as a main conclusion

that currently deployed random rebroadcast of time-sensitive transactions was probably

one of the most effective mitigation that could be solely deployed by lightning

implementation themselves. In this report, 2 variations of those new "transaction-relay

throughput attacks" are presented, i.e respectively the "high overflow" and "low overflow"

variants.

At the time of writing, the "high overflow" attack cost is evaluated to be around

$80k to target real-world lightning channels with safety timelocks in the the order

of four dozen of blocks.

In my reasonable opinion, I believe this new transaction-relay jamming attack can

be as much severe than already known state of the art non-mitigated attacks against

lightning channels while minding the junk transaction traffic cost. However more

investigations of this transaction-relay throughput attack vector can be very valuable.

This new off-chain protocol attack vector is tracked by the CVE-2024-55563,

under a single identifier for a "multiple software, same protocol / attack vector".

#### ## Background: Transaction-Relay Selection, Announcement & Propagation

At the protocol-level, summarily the transaction relay flow works in the following way.

On initially broadcasting a transaction, the full-node will issue an INV(inventory\_set)

to all its connected peers. Considering strictly transaction-relay messages, this inventory

set is composed of either MSG\_TX (non-wtxidrelay peers) or MSG\_WTX (bip339 wtxidrelay peers),

up to the inventory set limit (if the full-node implements any such inventory set limit).

For all the transaction identifiers announced in the inventory set, that are not normally

not already present in the peer inventory or caches at large, the peer will reply to the

node with a GETDATA(requested\_set(MSG\_TX)) or GETDATA(requested\_set(MSG\_WTX)) message. For

each element in the requested set of transactions, the node can forward an individual final

TX message to the peer.

The background description is realized using bitcoin core v28.0rc1 - commit 88f0419c1,

and it assumed to be run similarly by the node and it's connected transaction-relay peers.

At the implementation-level, bitcoin core presents a number of interfaces to natively

relay a transaction in the peer-to-peer network, though I'll only give the background

for 2 of them. Both those interfaces jointly drop transactions identifiers in the same

buffer, i.e the "forward transaction inventory" (`m\_tx\_inventory\_to\_send`).

The 1st) interface examined is the RPC method `sendrawtransaction()`, where a raw

transaction is shared for broadcast by the node (e.g by the wallet). The `BroadcastTransaction()`

is called and within this method correspondingly the logic to accept the single

message with a TX message (`ProcessTransaction()` / `AcceptToMemoryPool()`) and the

logic to relay the transasction over the peer-to-peer network (`RelayTransaction()`).

The second part, i.e the transaction relay logic is the one inserting the transaction

identifier in the forward transaction inventory of each connected transaction-relay peer.

The 2nd) interface examined is the TX message reception (`NetMsgType::TX`), where

a raw transaction is received from any connected peer. The transaction should be processed

by the mempool logic (`ProcessTransaction()`) and if it is accepted it's going to

be propagated to the remainder of the network (`ProcessValidTx()` / RelayTransaction()`),

by inserting the transaction identifier in the "forward transaction inventory".

Come after the transaction selection phase that yield the set of transactions

to be the object of an INV message to the connected transaction-relay peers. This

phase is modulated for each connected peer and happens at periodic ticks (`m\_next\_inv\_send\_time`).

During this transaction selection phase, the transactions are topologically ordered

and fee-rate sorted out from the peer's "forward transaction inventory" (`m\_tx\_inventory\_to\_send`).

This sorted inventory set is then drained up until reaching the INVENTORY\_BROADCAST\_MAX

limit (at max: 1000 transactions), and the transaction identifiers are assembled in

an INV message (either using MSG\_TX or MSG\_WTX) to be then communicated to the connected

transaction-relay peers.

After this selection phase, comes the announcement phase on the side of the node's peer.

At reception of an INV message, the inventory\_set received is sorted out, and if the

inventory element is a transaction (`IsGenTxMsg()`), the transaction identifier is

processed (`AddTxAnnouncement()`), and if the MAX\_PEER\_TX\_ANNOUNCEMENTS limit is not

reached, the transaction is queued by the transaction requester (`TxRequestTracker`).

If the transaction has been uniquely announced by the node, the peer should issue

a GETDATA download in the future time, driven by the requester logic (`GetRequestable()`).

If the transactions are announced by the node, faster than the peer can fetch and

download them, the MAX\_PEER\_TX\_ANNOUNCEMENTS limit provokes transaction to be dropped

on the floor.

The two limits INVENTORY\_BROADCAST\_MAX and MAX\_PEER\_TX\_ANNOUNCEMENTS are the targeted

components by "transaction-throughput overflow attacks" and there will be further analyzed.

#### ## Problem: Pre-Signed Time-Sensitive Transactions and Bounded Transaction-Relay Throughput

There are 2 variations of transaction-relay throughput overflow attacks identified so far,

respectively a "high overflow" attack and a "low overflow" attack. The explanation is started

by a "high overflow" attack.

##### ### "High-Overflow" Transaction-Relay Throughput Attack

In a "high overflow" attack, the goal of the adversary is to leverage the fee-rate sort

of the "forward transaction inventory" and the INVENTORY\_BROADCAST\_MAX to artificially

stuck down a subset of received transactions in the "forward transaction inventory".

The attack works in the following fashion against a Lightning routing node:

- there is the Mallet, Alice, Mallory channel topology

- Mallet routes a 0.5 BTC HTLC to Mallory through Alice with an interval timelock

- Alice and Mallory pre-signs the commitment + HTLC 2nd stage transaction at 5 sat / vbytes

- at the base-layer level, Alice full-node is connected by 45 inbound peers controlled by Malicia

- at the base-layer level, Alice is connected with a honest transaction-relay peer Bob

- Malicia injects 2300 small-size transactions at 10 sat / vbytes for each of the 45 inbound peers

- at time of the outbound HTLC expiration, Mallory breaks the channel with Alice, commitment + HTLC 2nd stage transactions are broadcast by Alice

- the constantly injected transaction traffic prevents lightning channel transactions to propagate on the Alice-Bob link

- after the interval timelock of blocks have been swallowed, the inbound HTLC is timeout by Mallet, the outbound HTLC is claimed by Mallory

Independently of transaction rebroadcast done by Alice lightning node, as long as it's done

at the same feerate, it still falls under the feerate threshold in the "forward transaction

inventory" generated by the throughput overflow traffic.

There is a simplified proof-of-concept of the high overflow of the feerate sorting

of an alice node's "forward transaction inventory" available here. Tested on a v27.0

bitcoin core software - commit d822839:

https://github.com/ariard/bitcoin/commit/8fc559a4bcd0a2ef8bb4c50aa540a5c4c61a310a

Note, in this example the feerate parameters are different ('effective-feerate'), i.e

"0.00010416" for the jammed transaction target and "0.00002083" and for the junk traffic

originating from the feedeer connection nodes. Running the test for a few attempt, yield

around ~2000 transactions, which is consistent with the INVENTORY\_BROADCAST\_PER\_SECOND limit

of 7 transactions second, or i.e 4200 transactions per average block.

Let's assume safety targeted timelocks are around 40 blocks (which is done by default by

some lightning network implementations), and the time-sensitive transactions are pre-signed

at 5 sat / virtual byte. If the individual transaction are of size 100 bytes, the throughput

overflow traffic is pre-signed at 10 sat / virtual byte, the attack liquidity cost is

estimated to be at 2\_100\_000 or $2k per block of delay. For a duration of 40 blocks, the

cost is estimated to be at 840\_00\_000 satoshis or $80\_000.

There are 3 observations to be made on this attack liquidity cost.

Firstly, the adversary can partition the victim's full-node mempool from the rest

of the peer-to-peer network to avoid the throughput overflow transaction traffic to

be effectively burned as on-chain miners fees. All the overflow transaction traffic

can be children junk that have a parent in the victim's people (Alice), but not in

its connected transaction-relay peers (Bob).

Secondly, the adversary can batch the liquidity cost to target a concurrent number

of lightning channels as lightning routing nodes are operating channels dissociately

in the lightning network. The throughput overflow limits, if bitcoin core is run

by default as a full-nodes, can be reached with a single contingent of junk transactions

originating from a unique UTXO set.

Thirdly, the adversary could recycle the traffic of junk children transactions

to lower the liquidity cost of the overall attack to few blocks of buffer, by

periodically spending the parent in the partitioned mempool to a new confirmed

UTXO, and re-generate a layout of junk children transactions.

##### ### "Low-Overflow" Transaction-Relay Throughput Attack

In a "low overflow" attack, the goal of the adversary is to leverage the

MAX\_PEER\_TX\_ANNOUCEMENTS limit until the inbound transactions received by

the peer from a node overflows this limit and subsequently provokes a drop

of the ulterior inbound transaction traffic.

This attack has been tested under few topological configurations of the

transaction-relay peer-to-peer network, where the MAX\_PEER\_TX\_ANNOUNCEMENTS

inbound limit of a target transaction-relay link is attempted to be overflowed.

Let's consider the following transaction-relay network topology: Alice <---> Bob.

Alice and Bob are 2 transaction-relay peers and both of them are running v28.0rc1.

It is assumed there are supporting wtxidrelay on their connections and that Alice

opened the connection to Bob (from Alice's node viewpoint Bob is an outbound peer

or an OUTBOUND\_FULL\_RELAY).

The name of the game for a "low-overflow" adversary is to open many inbound connections

to Alice node, and inject a high-number of junk transactions to reach Alice's "ingress"

limit of MAX\_PEER\_TX\_ANNOUNCEMENTS on each of those inbound connections. As such trying

to attain Bob's own MAX\_PEER\_TX\_ANNOUNCEMENTS's limit on Alice and Bob link.

Reconsidering the Alice and Bob's topology, let's enrich it with a number of

puppets nodes, and there will be the following topology:

- Mallet <---> Alice

- Mallory <---> Alice

- Malicia <---> Alice

All those 3 puppets inbound nodes are supporting wtxidrelay on theirs connections

and they are the ones opening connections to Alice (from Alice's node viewpoint

Mallet, Mallory and Malicia are all inbound peers, from Bob's node viewpoint they

are completely unrelated peers an ADDR message might not even exist for them).

Each of this peer can announce and transaction-relay up to 5000 unique and

new transactions to Alice so an "ingress" total of 15k transactions, while

the "egress" on the Alice-Bob link is still only 5000 transactions.

Repeating the trick in the 1st observation about partitoning full-node mempools,

all the transactions might not connect on Bob's mempool, as such the only way

for Bob to "discover" it is through announcements on the Alice-Bob link.

This network topology configuration has been tested, while none so far

triggering the MAX\_PEER\_TX\_ANNOUNCEMENT limit on the Alice - Bob connection.

This network topology configuration was initialized with 20 inbound peers

connected to Alice, with each a stock of 4600 transactions to announce to

Alice and the configuration ran for 1 hour. Bob's mempool was accusing

a deficit of ~10k of transactions at the end of the test.

At the 33th minute, the internal buffer of the `TxRequesterTracker` tracking

the number of announced transactions reached the max size of 1252, with an

initial size of 0 (minute 0 ) and a size of 780, at the end of the 60th minute.

https://github.com/ariard/bitcoin/commit/c958f22e4cb7c193378ad7cd1c05b2c331ad6bd5

This network topology configuration had only one link to be processed by

Bob i.e the Alice-Bob transaction-relay link. More advanced experimental

tests of a "low-overflow throughput" attack could be, e.g (non-exhaustive):

- Bob's node being opened up to `DEFAULT\_MAX\_PEER\_CONNECTIONS` with average tx traffic

- Bob's node receiving a valid block every 10 min

All those elements are busying the CPUs ressources available to the Bob node,

and as such it should diminish processing threads available to process the

"egress" traffic received from Alice, let's say on modern x86\_64 chips.

In my reasonable belief, this "low overflow", if it's practical feasibility

can be demonstrated, is indeed more severe than the "high overflow" variant,

as there is no external feerate to meet to thwart the propagation of a

target transaction (e.g a lightning time-sensitive justice transaction).

The liquidity cost is no more linear on the current value of the

MAX\_PEER\_TX\_ANNOUNCEMENT limit and the mininal valid transaction size.

#### ## Solutions

On the pure lightning-side / contracting protocol implementations and node

operators, there are 4 mitigations that can be envisioned. I believe the

mitigation d) can be the more efficient, namely deploying more full-nodes

singly connected to the transaction-relay initiating node to absorb the

overflow of transactions.

a) Random transaction rebroadcast: for "low-overflow", a lightning node

could more aggressively re-sign and rebroadcast time-sensitive transactions,

probabilistically diminishing the odds of the overflow reaching

MAX\_PEER\_TX\_ANNOUNCEMENTS.

b) Aggressive fee-rebroadcasting: for "high-overflow" dyamic fee-rebroadcasting

can asymetrically increase the attack cost. On the other hand, this is increasing

surface to miner harvesting attacks, where a miner could inject junk children

traffic to trigger a lightning node to fee-bump time-sensitive transactions [1].

c) Limitation of "Identical Finality" Time-Sensitive Transactions: for "low-overflow",

a lightning routing hop could limit the number of transactions with the "identical

finality" (i.e absolute or relative timelock being final at the same chain tip) to

limit the worst-case flow of time-sensitive transactions that have to propagate on

the network, at the same chain-defined time period.

d) Over-provisioning transaction-relay throughput with adjacent full-nodes: both

for "high-overflow" and "low-overflow", the initial transaction-relay node can

be made no listening for peers connections and block-relay-only. All the

transaction-relay connections can be opened to adjacent "trusted" full-nodes,

that can swallow more of the overflow traffic. Those adjacent full-nodes can

be regularly connected to the bitcoin network.

Mitigations at the base-layer directly in the transaction-relay stack were not

seriously considered during the embargo period. In my personal opinion, a

a robust mitigation against transaction-relay throughput attacks could be

more efficient at the base-layer, rather than at the lightning / contracting

protocols levels.

#### ## Timeline

- 2024-12-03: CVE ID Request shared to the MITRE

#### ## Conclusion

In this report, a new transaction-relay jamming attack against off-chain protocols

was introduced by exploiting the throughput limits of a full-node transaction-relay

selection, announcement and propagation algorithms. This attack appears to be

plausible against lightning channel funds under real-world scenario, while it

deserves indeed more investigationg and experiment.

Two variations of the attacks have been presented, a "high-oveflow" variant,

exploiting the transaction announcement fee-rate sorting algorithm on the

sender-side, and a "low-overflow" variant, exploiting the announcement processing

limits on the receiver-side. The first variant is presented with a minimal

proof-of-concept, while the second variant is left open for future research.

All mistakes and opinions are my own and please verify any information reported.

[0] "...should be always evaluated with regards to base layer network topology,

\*tx-relay propagation rules\*, mempools behaviors, consistent policy applied by majority

an incentive to tweak them to steal from you..."

On July 28 2010, two bugs were discovered and demonstrated on the test network. One caused bitcoin to crash on some machines when processing a transaction containing an OP\_LSHIFT. This was never exploited on the main network, and was fixed by Bitcoin version 0.3.5.

After these bugs were discovered, many currently-unused script words were disabled for safety.

On July 29 2010, it was discovered that block [71036](http://blockexplorer.com/block/00000000000997f9fd2fe1ee376293ef8c42ad09193a5d2086dddf8e5c426b56) contained several transactions with a ton of OP\_CHECKSIG commands. There should only ever be one such command. This caused every node to do extra unnecessary work, and it could have been used as a denial-of-service attack. A new version of Bitcoin was quickly released. The new version did not cause a fork on the main network, though it did cause one on the test network (where someone had played around with the attack more).

On August 15 2010, it was [discovered](http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=822.0) that block 74638 contained a transaction that created over 184 billion bitcoins for two different addresses. This was possible because the code used for checking transactions before including them in a block didn't account for the case of outputs so large that they overflowed when summed. A new version was published within a few hours of the discovery. The block chain had to be forked. Although many unpatched nodes continued to build on the "bad" block chain, the "good" block chain overtook it at a block height of 74691. The bad transaction no longer exists for people using the longest chain.

The block and transaction:

Around September 29, 2010, people started [reporting](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1306.0) that their sent transactions would not confirm. This happened because people modified Bitcoin to send sub-0.01 transactions without any fees. A 0.01 fee was at that time required by the network for such transactions (essentially prohibiting them), so the transactions remained at 0 confirmations forever. This became a more serious issue because Bitcoin would send transactions using bitcoins gotten from transactions with 0 confirmations, and these resulting transactions would also never confirm. Because Bitcoin tends to prefer sending smaller coins, these invalid transactions quickly multiplied, contaminating the wallets of everyone who received them.

Bitcoin was changed to only select coins with at least 1 confirmation. The remaining sub-0.01 transactions were cleared by generators who modified their version of Bitcoin to not require the micropayment fee. It took a while for everything to get cleared, though, because many of the intermediate transactions had been forgotten by the network by this point and had to be rebroadcast by the original senders.

## CVE-2012-2459

```
Date: 2012-05-14
Summary: Block hash collision (via merkle tree)
Fix Deployment: 100%

```

| Affected | | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bitcoin-Qtbitcoind | \* - 0.4.6rc10.5.0rc1 - 0.5.5rc10.6.0rc1 - 0.6.0.7rc10.6.1rc1 - 0.6.1rc1 | 0.4.60.5.50.6.0.70.6.1rc2 |

Block hash collisions can easily be made by duplicating transactions in the merkle tree.
Such a collision is invalid, but if recorded (as Bitcoin-Qt and bitcoind prior to 0.6.1 did) would prevent acceptance of the legitimate block with the same hash.
This could be used to fork the blockchain, including deep double-spend attacks.

Hi all,

I'm writing a report to disclose a new transaction-relay jamming attack
affecting bitcoin time-sensitive contracting protocols by exploiting the
transaction
selection, announcement and propagation mechanisms of base-layer full-nodes.

Back in 2020, amid numerous technical conversations among bitcoin protocol
developers
about how bip125 replace-by-fee rules could be abused by a lightning
channel counterparty
with a competing interest (a.k.a pinning attack, see BIP431's motivation
for more), it
was thought that few other components of the bitcoin tx-relay p2p stack
could be also
adversarially exploited [0] (In the lack of familiarity with lightning /
contracting
protocol security risks, go to read the old post pointed by footnote).

Mid-2023, I did privately message a group of long-term bitcoin and lightning
developers detailing those new "transaction-relay throughput attacks"
concerns,
especially the different exploitations and the technical feasibility of
such attack.

While this attack was deemed worthy of more investigations and practical
testing, it
was relatively put in the background due to more severe security issues
affecting
lightning at the time (i.e 2023). Recent conversations this year (i.e 2024)
about
free relay attacks of full-node bandwidths made me think to reconsider the
practical
cost of transaction-relay throughput attacks, and as such proceeds to a
full disclosure.

Since my personal awareness in 2020 of this potential vector of attack
enabling to
steal funds from lightning channel funds, I've not seen exploitations in
the wild or
corresponding hints that could reveal such new transaction-relay jamming
attack
being practically used.

In this report, 2 variations of those new "transaction-relay throughput
attacks"
are presented, i.e respectively the "high overflow" and the "low overflow"
variant.
There is a proof-of-concept available for the "high overflow" variation
tested on
bitcoin core v27.0. The "high overflow" variation has been tested under few
topological
configurations, though no under real-world workload. Coming with a
proof-of-concept
to demonstrate the feasibility of the 2nd variation stays an open subject
of investigation.
(see corresponding subsection for more).

After conversation with few lightning maintainers, it arises as a main
conclusion
that currently deployed random rebroadcast of time-sensitive transactions
was probably
one of the most effective mitigation that could be solely deployed by
lightning
implementation themselves. In this report, 2 variations of those new
"transaction-relay
throughput attacks" are presented, i.e respectively the "high overflow" and
"low overflow"
variants.

At the time of writing, the "high overflow" attack cost is evaluated to be
around
$80k to target real-world lightning channels with safety timelocks in the
the order
of four dozen of blocks.

In my reasonable opinion, I believe this new transaction-relay jamming
attack can
be as much severe than already known state of the art non-mitigated attacks
against
lightning channels while minding the junk transaction traffic cost. However
more
investigations of this transaction-relay throughput attack vector can be
very valuable.

This new off-chain protocol attack vector is currently tracked by the CVE
Request 1780258 shared to the MITRE, under a single identifier for a
"multiple
software, same protocol / attack vector". Report should be updated when a
stable
identifier is definitely assigned.

## Background: Transaction-Relay Selection, Announcement & Propagation

At the protocol-level, summarily the transaction relay flow works in the
following way.
On initially broadcasting a transaction, the full-node will issue an
INV(inventory_set)
to all its connected peers. Considering strictly transaction-relay
messages, this inventory
set is composed of either MSG_TX (non-wtxidrelay peers) or MSG_WTX (bip339
wtxidrelay peers),
up to the inventory set limit (if the full-node implements any such
inventory set limit).

For all the transaction identifiers announced in the inventory set, that
are not normally
not already present in the peer inventory or caches at large, the peer will
reply to the
node with a GETDATA(requested_set(MSG_TX)) or
GETDATA(requested_set(MSG_WTX)) message. For
each element in the requested set of transactions, the node can forward an
individual final
TX message to the peer.

The background description is realized using bitcoin core v28.0rc1 - commit
88f0419c1,
and it is assumed to be run similarly by the node and it's connected
transaction-relay peers.

At the implementation-level, bitcoin core presents a number of interfaces
to natively
relay a transaction in the peer-to-peer network, though I'll only give the
background
for 2 of them. Both those interfaces jointly drop transactions identifiers
in the same
buffer, i.e the "forward transaction inventory" (`m_tx_inventory_to_send`).

The 1st) interface examined is the RPC method `sendrawtransaction()`, where
a raw
transaction is shared for broadcast by the node (e.g by the wallet). The
`BroadcastTransaction()`
is called and within this method correspondingly the logic to accept the
single
message with a TX message (`ProcessTransaction()` / `AcceptToMemoryPool()`)
and the
logic to relay the transaction over the peer-to-peer network
(`RelayTransaction()`).
The second part, i.e the transaction relay logic is the one inserting the
transaction
identifier in the forward transaction inventory of each connected
transaction-relay peer.

The 2nd) interface examined is the TX message reception (`NetMsgType::TX`),
where
a raw transaction is received from any connected peer. The transaction
should be processed
by the mempool logic (`ProcessTransaction()`) and if it is accepted it's
going to
be propagated to the remainder of the network (`ProcessValidTx()` /
RelayTransaction()`),
by inserting the transaction identifier in the "forward transaction
inventory".

Come after the transaction selection phase that yield the set of
transactions
to be the object of an INV message to the connected transaction-relay
peers. This
phase is modulated for each connected peer and happens at periodic ticks
(`m_next_inv_send_time`).
During this transaction selection phase, the transactions are topologically
ordered
and fee-rate sorted out from the peer's "forward transaction inventory"
(`m_tx_inventory_to_send`).

This sorted inventory set is then drained up until reaching the
INVENTORY_BROADCAST_MAX
limit (at max: 1000 transactions), and the transaction identifiers are
assembled in
an INV message (either using MSG_TX or MSG_WTX) to be then communicated to
the connected
transaction-relay peers.

After this selection phase, comes the announcement phase on the side of the
node's peer.
At reception of an INV message, the inventory_set received is sorted out,
and if the
inventory element is a transaction (`IsGenTxMsg()`), the transaction
identifier is
processed (`AddTxAnnouncement()`), and if the MAX_PEER_TX_ANNOUNCEMENTS
limit is not
reached, the transaction is queued by the transaction requester
(`TxRequestTracker`).

If the transaction has been uniquely announced by the node, the peer should
issue
a GETDATA download in the future time, driven by the requester logic
(`GetRequestable()`).
If the transactions are announced by the node, faster than the peer can
fetch and
download them, the MAX_PEER_TX_ANNOUNCEMENTS limit provokes transaction to
be dropped
on the floor.

The two limits INVENTORY_BROADCAST_MAX and MAX_PEER_TX_ANNOUNCEMENTS are
the targeted
components by "transaction-throughput overflow attacks" and there will be
further analyzed.

## Problem: Pre-Signed Time-Sensitive Transactions and Bounded
Transaction-Relay Throughput

There are 2 variations of transaction-relay throughput overflow attacks
identified so far,
respectively a "high overflow" attack and a "low overflow" attack. The
explanation is started
by a "high overflow" attack.

### "High-Overflow" Transaction-Relay Throughput Attack

In a "high overflow" attack, the goal of the adversary is to leverage the
fee-rate sort
of the "forward transaction inventory" and the INVENTORY_BROADCAST_MAX to
artificially
stuck down a subset of received transactions in the "forward transaction
inventory".

The attack works in the following fashion against a Lightning routing node:
- there is the Mallet, Alice, Mallory channel topology
- Mallet routes a 0.5 BTC HTLC to Mallory through Alice with an interval
timelock
- Alice and Mallory pre-signs the commitment + HTLC 2nd stage transaction
at 5 sat / vbytes
- at the base-layer level, Alice full-node is connected by 45 inbound peers
controlled by Malicia
- at the base-layer level, Alice is connected with a honest
transaction-relay peer Bob
- Malicia injects 2300 small-size transactions at 10 sat / vbytes for each
of the 45 inbound peers
- at time of the outbound HTLC expiration, Mallory breaks the channel with
Alice, commitment + HTLC 2nd stage transactions are broadcast by Alice
- the constantly injected transaction traffic prevents lightning channel
transactions to propagate on the Alice-Bob link
- after the interval timelock of blocks have been swallowed, the inbound
HTLC is timeout by Mallet, the outbound HTLC is claimed by Mallory

Independently of transaction rebroadcast done by Alice lightning node, as
long as it's done
at the same feerate, it still falls under the feerate threshold in the
"forward transaction
inventory" generated by the throughput overflow traffic.

There is a simplified proof-of-concept of the high overflow of the feerate
sorting
of an alice node's "forward transaction inventory" available here. Tested
on a v27.0
bitcoin core software - commit d822839:

<https://github.com/ariard/bitcoin/commit/8fc559a4bcd0a2ef8bb4c50aa540a5c4c61a310a>

Note, in this example the feerate parameters are different
('effective-feerate'), i.e
"0.00010416" for the jammed transaction target and "0.00002083" and for the
junk traffic
originating from the feeder connection nodes. Running the test for a few
attempt, yield
around ~2000 transactions, which is consistent with the
INVENTORY_BROADCAST_PER_SECOND limit
of 7 transactions second, or i.e 4200 transactions per average block.

Let's assume safety targeted timelocks are around 40 blocks (which is done
by default by
some lightning network implementations), and the time-sensitive
transactions are pre-signed
at 5 sat / virtual byte. If the individual transaction are of size 100
bytes, the throughput
overflow traffic is pre-signed at 10 sat / virtual byte, the attack
liquidity cost is
estimated to be at 2_100_000 or $2k per block of delay. For a duration of
40 blocks, the
cost is estimated to be at 840_00_000 satoshis or $80_000.

There are 3 observations to be made on this attack liquidity cost.

Firstly, the adversary can partition the victim's full-node mempool from
the rest
of the peer-to-peer network to avoid the throughput overflow transaction
traffic to
be effectively burned as on-chain miners fees. All the overflow transaction
traffic
can be children junk that have a parent in the victim's people (Alice), but
not in
its connected transaction-relay peers (Bob).

Secondly, the adversary can batch the liquidity cost to target a concurrent
number
of lightning channels as lightning routing nodes are operating channels
dissociately
in the lightning network. The throughput overflow limits, if bitcoin core
is run
by default as a full-nodes, can be reached with a single contingent of junk
transactions
originating from a unique UTXO set.

Thirdly, the adversary could recycle the traffic of junk children
transactions
to lower the liquidity cost of the overall attack to few blocks of buffer,
by
periodically spending the parent in the partitioned mempool to a new
confirmed
UTXO, and re-generate a layout of junk children transactions.

### "Low-Overflow" Transaction-Relay Throughput Attack

In a "low overflow" attack, the goal of the adversary is to leverage the
MAX_PEER_TX_ANNOUCEMENTS limit until the inbound transactions received by
the peer from a node overflows this limit and subsequently provokes a drop
of the ulterior inbound transaction traffic.

This attack has been tested under few topological configurations of the
transaction-relay peer-to-peer network, where the MAX_PEER_TX_ANNOUNCEMENTS
inbound limit of a target transaction-relay link is attempted to be
overflowed.

Let's consider the following transaction-relay network topology: Alice
<---> Bob.

Alice and Bob are 2 transaction-relay peers and both of them are running
v28.0rc1.
It is assumed there are supporting wtxidrelay on their connections and that
Alice
opened the connection to Bob (from Alice's node viewpoint Bob is an
outbound peer
or an OUTBOUND_FULL_RELAY).

The name of the game for a "low-overflow" adversary is to open many inbound
connections
to Alice node, and inject a high-number of junk transactions to reach
Alice's "ingress"
limit of MAX_PEER_TX_ANNOUNCEMENTS on each of those inbound connections. As
such trying
to attain Bob's own MAX_PEER_TX_ANNOUNCEMENTS's limit on Alice and Bob link.

Reconsidering the Alice and Bob's topology, let's enrich it with a number of
puppets nodes, and there will be the following topology:
- Mallet <---> Alice
- Mallory <---> Alice
- Malicia <---> Alice

All those 3 puppets inbound nodes are supporting wtxidrelay on theirs
connections
and they are the ones opening connections to Alice (from Alice's node
viewpoint
Mallet, Mallory and Malicia are all inbound peers, from Bob's node
viewpoint they
are completely unrelated peers an ADDR message might not even exist for
them).

Each of this peer can announce and transaction-relay up to 5000 unique and
new transactions to Alice so an "ingress" total of 15k transactions, while
the "egress" on the Alice-Bob link is still only 5000 transactions.

Repeating the trick in the 1st observation about partitioning full-node
mempools,
all the transactions might not connect on Bob's mempool, as such the only
way
for Bob to "discover" it is through announcements on the Alice-Bob link.

This network topology configuration has been tested, while none so far
triggering the MAX_PEER_TX_ANNOUNCEMENT limit on the Alice - Bob connection.

This network topology configuration was initialized with 20 inbound peers
connected to Alice, with each a stock of 4600 transactions to announce to
Alice and the configuration ran for 1 hour. Bob's mempool was accusing
a deficit of ~10k of transactions at the end of the test.

At the 33th minute, the internal buffer of the `TxRequesterTracker` tracking
the number of announced transactions reached the max size of 1252, with an
initial size of 0 (minute 0 ) and a size of 780, at the end of the 60th
minute.

<https://github.com/ariard/bitcoin/commit/c958f22e4cb7c193378ad7cd1c05b2c331ad6bd5>

This network topology configuration had only one link to be processed by
Bob i.e the Alice-Bob transaction-relay link. More advanced experimental
tests of a "low-overflow throughput" attack could be, e.g (non-exhaustive):
- Bob's node being opened up to `DEFAULT_MAX_PEER_CONNECTIONS` with average
tx traffic
- Bob's node receiving a valid block every 10 min

All those elements are busying the CPUs resources available to the Bob node,
and as such it should diminish processing threads available to process the
"egress" traffic received from Alice, let's say on modern x86_64 chips.

In my reasonable belief, this "low overflow", if it's practical feasibility
can be demonstrated, is indeed more severe than the "high overflow" variant,
as there is no external feerate to meet to thwart the propagation of a
target transaction (e.g a lightning time-sensitive justice transaction).
The liquidity cost is no more linear on the current value of the
MAX_PEER_TX_ANNOUNCEMENT limit and the minimal valid transaction size.

## Solutions

On the pure lightning-side / contracting protocol implementations and node
operators, there are 4 mitigations that can be envisioned. I believe the
mitigation d) can be the more efficient, namely deploying more full-nodes
singly connected to the transaction-relay initiating node to absorb the
overflow of transactions.

a) Random transaction rebroadcast: for "low-overflow", a lightning node
could more aggressively re-sign and rebroadcast time-sensitive transactions,
probabilistically diminishing the odds of the overflow reaching
MAX_PEER_TX_ANNOUNCEMENTS.

b) Aggressive fee-rebroadcasting: for "high-overflow" dynamic
fee-rebroadcasting
can asymmetrically increase the attack cost. On the other hand, this is
increasing
surface to miner harvesting attacks, where a miner could inject junk
children
traffic to trigger a lightning node to fee-bump time-sensitive transactions
[1].

c) Limitation of "Identical Finality" Time-Sensitive Transactions: for
"low-overflow",
a lightning routing hop could limit the number of transactions with the
"identical
finality" (i.e absolute or relative timelock being final at the same chain
tip) to
limit the worst-case flow of time-sensitive transactions that have to
propagate on
the network, at the same chain-defined time period.

d) Over-provisioning transaction-relay throughput with adjacent full-nodes:
both
for "high-overflow" and "low-overflow", the initial transaction-relay node
can
be made no listening for peers connections and block-relay-only. All the
transaction-relay connections can be opened to adjacent "trusted"
full-nodes,
that can swallow more of the overflow traffic. Those adjacent full-nodes can
be regularly connected to the bitcoin network.

Mitigations at the base-layer directly in the transaction-relay stack were
not
seriously considered during the embargo period. In my personal opinion, a
a robust mitigation against transaction-relay throughput attacks could be
more efficient at the base-layer, rather than at the lightning / contracting
protocols levels.

## Conclusion

In this report, a new transaction-relay jamming attack against off-chain
protocols
was introduced by exploiting the throughput limits of a full-node
transaction-relay
selection, announcement and propagation algorithms. This attack appears to
be
plausible against lightning channel funds under real-world scenario, while
it
deserves indeed more investigation and experiment.

Two variations of the attacks have been presented, a "high-overflow"
variant,
exploiting the transaction announcement fee-rate sorting algorithm on the
sender-side, and a "low-overflow" variant, exploiting the announcement
processing
limits on the receiver-side. The first variant is presented with a minimal
proof-of-concept, while the second variant is left open for future research.

All mistakes and opinions are my own and please verify any information
