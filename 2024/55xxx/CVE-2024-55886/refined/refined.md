- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the OpenTelemetry Logs source in Data Prepper using custom authentication plugins that implement `getHttpAuthenticationService()` instead of `getAuthenticationInterceptor()`. This bypasses authentication for those plugins.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper authentication handling in custom plugins for the OpenTelemetry Logs source. Specifically, the use of `getHttpAuthenticationService()` instead of `getAuthenticationInterceptor()`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized users can ingest OpenTelemetry Logs data. This allows unauthorized access to write to the OpenTelemetry Logs source endpoint leading to data integrity issues.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access to the OpenTelemetry Logs source endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access and the system needs to be configured with a custom authentication provider using the vulnerable implementation. The attack has a high complexity and requires user interaction.
