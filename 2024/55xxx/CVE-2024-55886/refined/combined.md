# OpenTelemetry Logs source may lack authentication with some custom plugins

Moderate

[cwperks](/cwperks)
published
GHSA-725p-63vv-v948
Dec 12, 2024

## Package

docker

opensearchproject/data-prepper
([Docker](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Adocker))

## Affected versions

>= 2.1.0, < 2.10.2

## Patched versions

2.10.2

## Description

### Description

A vulnerability exists in the OpenTelemetry Logs source in Data Prepper where some custom authentication plugins will not perform authentication. This allows unauthorized users to ingest OpenTelemetry Logs data under certain conditions.

This vulnerability does not affect the built-in `http_basic` authentication provider in Data Prepper. Pipelines which use the `http_basic` authentication provider continue to require authentication.

The vulnerability exists only for custom implementations of Data Prepper’s `GrpcAuthenticationProvider` authentication plugin which implement the `getHttpAuthenticationService()` method instead of `getAuthenticationInterceptor()`.

### Impact

This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to write to the OpenTelemetry Logs source endpoint. It only impacts environments which use a custom authentication provider. In this situation the OpenTelemetry Logs source may accept data from unauthorized sources.

### Patches

Data Prepper 2.10.2 contains a fix for this issue.

### Workarounds

For those unable to upgrade, consider the following mitigations:

* Use the built-in `http_basic` authentication provider in Data Prepper.
* Add an authentication proxy in front of your Data Prepper instances running the OpenTelemetry Logs source.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
