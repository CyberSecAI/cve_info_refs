Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-55603:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content directly addresses CVE-2024-55603, as the GitHub security advisory `GHSA-gv5c-8pxr-p484` explicitly states that it is associated with the CVE ID. The advisory details an "Insufficient session invalidation" vulnerability in Kanboard, which matches the CVE description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies within the custom session handler implementation (`app/Core/Session/SessionHandler.php`) in Kanboard. Specifically, the `read()` method did not check if the session had expired before retrieving session data from the database. While the `gc()` function would eventually remove expired sessions, it's not called on every request. The `gc()` function is called based on a probability defined in php.ini, and thus, expired sessions could still be retrieved.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Session Invalidation:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation of session expiration in the `read()` method.
*   **Reliance on Probabilistic Garbage Collection:** The system's dependence on PHP's garbage collector for expiring sessions, which only runs based on a configurable probability, leaves a window of opportunity for attackers to exploit.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Indefinite Session Usage:** An attacker who obtains a valid session ID can continue using that session even after its intended lifetime has passed. This allows for persistent access.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker could use an existing session ID (obtained via a stolen cookie, for example) well after the session should have expired to bypass authentication.
*   The attack vector is network based and is of low complexity. No privileges or user interaction are needed.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs a valid session ID. This could be obtained through eavesdropping on network traffic, cookie theft, or other means.
*   The attacker can be remote (network based).

**7. Additional Technical Details (from provided content):**

*   The vulnerability was found by Deutsche Telekom Security GmbH.
*   The fix was introduced in Kanboard version 1.2.43.
*   The fix involves adding a condition `->gt('expire_at', time())` to the database query in the `read()` function, ensuring that only non-expired sessions are loaded.
*   The `session.gc_probability` and `session.gc_divisor` settings were also modified to increase the probability of garbage collection in the official docker image.

**CVSS Metrics:**

The advisory also provides a CVSS v3 score:
`CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N`

*   Attack Vector: Network (N)
*   Attack Complexity: Low (L)
*   Privileges Required: None (N)
*   User Interaction: None (N)
*   Scope: Unchanged (U)
*   Confidentiality: Low (L)
*   Integrity: Low (L)
*   Availability: None (N)

**CWE:**

*   CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration

In summary, CVE-2024-55603 is caused by a failure to properly validate session expiration in Kanboard's custom session handler. This allowed an attacker with a valid session ID to bypass authentication, as the session is still considered valid even after its expiration time. The fix involves a simple change to the `read()` function, and some changes in the garbage collection settings.
