# Oqtane Framework

[![Oqtane](https://github.com/oqtane/framework/raw/master/oqtane.png?raw=true "Oqtane")](https://github.com/oqtane/framework/blob/master/oqtane.png?raw=true)

Oqtane is an open source Content Management System (CMS) and Application Framework that provides advanced functionality for developing web, mobile, and desktop applications on modern .NET.

Oqtane allows you to "Build Applications, Not Infrastructure" which means that you can focus your investment on solving your unique business challenges rather than wasting time and effort on building general infrastructure.

Oqtane is "Rocket Fuel for Blazor" as it provides powerful capabilities to accelerate your Blazor development experience, providing scalable services and a composable UI which can be hosted on Static Blazor, Blazor Server, Blazor WebAssembly, or Blazor Hybrid (via .NET MAUI).

Oqtane is being developed based on some fundamental principles which are outlined in the [Oqtane Philosophy](https://www.oqtane.org/blog/%21/20/oqtane-philosophy). This project is an official member of the .NET Foundation and is governed by the **[.NET Foundation Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://dotnetfoundation.org/code-of-conduct)**

# Getting Started (Version 6.x)

**Installing using source code from the Dev/Master branch:**

* Install **[.NET 9.0.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)**.
* Install the latest edition (v17.12 or higher) of [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads) with the **ASP.NET and web development** workload enabled. Oqtane works with ALL editions of Visual Studio from Community to Enterprise. If you wish to use LocalDB for development ( not a requirement as Oqtane supports SQLite, mySQL, and PostgreSQL ) you must also install the **Data storage and processing**.
* Clone (or download) the Oqtane Master or Dev branch source code to your local system.
* Open the **Oqtane.sln** solution file.
* **Important:** Rebuild the entire solution before running it (ie. Build / Rebuild Solution).
* Make sure you specify Oqtane.Server as the Startup Project.
* Run the application... an Installation Wizard screen will be displayed which will allow you to configure your preferred database and create a host user account.

**Developing a custom module:**

* follow the instructions for installing using source code outlined above
* login as the host user
* navigate to Control Panel (gear icon at top-right of page), Admin Dashboard, Module Management
* select Create Module
* enter information corresponding to the module you wish to create and then select the Create button
* make note of the Location where the code was generated and open the solution file in Visual Studio
* Build / Rebuild Solution, ensure the Oqtane.Server is set as the Startup Project, and hit F5 to run the solution

**Installing an official release:**

* all official releases of Oqtane are distributed on [GitHub](https://github.com/oqtane/oqtane.framework/releases). Releases include an Install.zip package for new installations and an Upgrade.zip for existing installations.
* A detailed set of instructions for installing Oqtane on Azure is located here: [Installing Oqtane on Azure](https://blazorhelpwebsite.com/ViewBlogPost/1)
* A detailed set of instructions for installing Oqtane on IIS is located here: [Installing Oqtane on IIS](https://www.oqtane.org/Resources/Blog/PostId/542/installing-oqtane-on-iis)
* Instructions for upgrading Oqtane are located here: [Upgrading Oqtane](https://www.oqtane.org/Resources/Blog/PostId/543/upgrading-oqtane)

**Additional Instructions**

* If you have already installed a previous version of Oqtane and you wish to do a clean database install, simply reset the DefaultConnection value in the Oqtane.Server\appsettings.json file to "". This will trigger a re-install when you run the application which will execute the database installation.
* If you want to submit pull requests make sure you install the [Github Extension For Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.github.com/). It is recommended you ignore any local changes you have made to the appsettings.json file before you submit a pull request. To automate this activity, open a command prompt and navigate to the /Oqtane.Server/ folder and enter the command "git update-index --skip-worktree appsettings.json"

**Video Series**

* If you are getting started with Oqtane, a [series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPfUZPlRRCE&list=PLYhXmd7yV0elLNLfQwZBUlM7ZSMYPTZ_f) are available which explain how to install the product, interact with the user interface, and develop custom modules.

# Introduction

Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerabilities are among the most common and impactful issues listed in the [**OWASP Top 10**](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)under the category of **Broken Access Control (A01:2021)**. [**CVE-2024–55471**](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-55471)highlights such a flaw in the [Oqtane framework](https://github.com/oqtane/oqtane.framework), specifically in the `Oqtane.Controllers.UserController.Get` endpoint. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to access sensitive information of other accounts by manipulating API request parameters. In this blog, we will dissect the vulnerability, its impact, and how such issues can be mitigated in alignment with OWASP-recommended best practices.

# Summary

[**CVE-2024–5547**](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-55471)1 is an IDOR vulnerability identified in the `Oqtane.Controllers.UserController.Get` endpoint. By modifying the User ID parameter in API requests, attackers can bypass access controls and retrieve sensitive data of other users. This issue is a prime example of the risks outlined in the [**OWASP Top 10**](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/), particularly under Broken Access Control. The lack of robust server-side validation compromises user privacy, application integrity, and overall security.

# Technical Details

![]()

The vulnerability lies in the way the API endpoint processes requests:

* **Incriminated Endpoint:**
  `http://localhost:5000/api/User/{id}?siteid=1`
* **Affected Component:**
  `Oqtane.Controllers.UserController.Get`
* **Vulnerability Description:**
  The endpoint does not enforce adequate authorization checks to verify whether the requesting user is entitled to access the data for a specific `id`. As a result, an attacker can tamper with the `id` parameter and retrieve sensitive information belonging to other users.
* **Exploitation Example:**
  An attacker sends an API request to the vulnerable endpoint:

```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/User/1001?siteid=1
```

* By changing the `id` parameter (e.g., `1001` to `1002`), they can retrieve the data of another user without any restrictions.

# **Impact**

![]()

The risks associated with [CVE-2024–55471](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-55471) include:

1. **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can view sensitive user information.
2. **Privacy Breach:** User privacy is compromised when unauthorized parties access personal data.
3. **Application Integrity Risks:** The vulnerability undermines the trustworthiness of the application.
4. **Potential for Further Exploitation:** This flaw could act as a stepping stone for other attacks, such as privilege escalation or account takeover.

# **Remediation**

![]()

To mitigate the risks associated with this vulnerability, consider the following best practices:

1. **Implement Robust Authorization Checks:** Ensure the server verifies that the requesting user is authorized to access or modify the data associated with a specific `id`.
2. **Use Indirect References:** Replace direct object references like user IDs with indirect references (e.g., tokens or hashes).
3. **Secure API Development:** Follow secure API development practices, including proper input validation and authentication mechanisms.
4. **Regular Security Testing:** Conduct regular penetration tests to identify and address vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them.
5. **Patch Management:** Ensure that security patches addressing vulnerabilities are promptly applied.

# **Conclusion**

[CVE-2024–55471](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-55471) highlights how a single oversight in access control mechanisms can jeopardize user privacy and application security. By addressing IDOR vulnerabilities through secure coding practices, robust authorization mechanisms, and proactive security measures, organizations can safeguard their systems and user data.

If you’re using Oqtane Version 6.0.0 or an earlier release, it’s essential to update and apply fixes immediately to protect against this vulnerability.
