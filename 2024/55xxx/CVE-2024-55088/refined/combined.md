Making GetSimple CMS great again!

## What is GetSimple CMS CE?

GetSimple CE is an XML based, stand-a-alone, fully independent and lite Content Management System. To go along with its best-in-class user interface, it is loaded with features that every website needs, but with nothing it doesn't.

**GetSimple CE** truly is the simplest way to manage a small-business website. **Now supporting php7.4-8.x.**

### Support for the Latest PHP

The original version ended its support with version 7.4. Many web hosts require a newer version
of PHP. Fortunately, the CE version has full support for the latest versions.

### Updated Plugin Library

Many plugins still have trouble working with newer versions of PHP. We decided to sit down on
this issue and prepare the work of other developers for action.

### So Many Possibilities

Many years of work have allowed us to create a solution that adds a lot of improvements to the
original version with the help of the Massive Admin plugin. Including changing the default
admin panel theme. You can even write your own!

Icon
### Everything is ready

With a built-in plugins download system inside the dashboard, you'll be able to install them faster than ever.
Making sure they will work with the CE version

Icon
### Finally Responsive!

GetSimple CMS was created quite a long time ago. The creators did not think about mobile
devices at that time. Fortunately, many of these issues have been fixed. And with the new
default ResponsiveCE theme, you can easily create a modern website.

### Questions?

If you have any questions, we will be happy to answer on Discord or Github dedicated to
GetSimple CMS CE. Are you missing any solutions? Have you encountered an error? Some plugin
is not in the CE repository? We also look forward to hearing from you!
