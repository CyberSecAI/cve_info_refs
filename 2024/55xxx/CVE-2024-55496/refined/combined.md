| NAME OF AFFECTED PRODUCT(S)  * Bookstore Management System PHP MySQL Project  Vendor Homepage  * <https://1000projects.org/bookstore-management-system-php-mysql-project.html>  AFFECTED AND/OR FIXED VERSION(S)  * submitter   蓝翔技校王主任 * Vulnerable File   add\_company.php * VERSION(S)   V1.0 * Software Link   <https://1000projects.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Bookstore-Management-System.7z>  PROBLEM TYPE  * Vulnerability Type   SQL injection * Root Cause   A SQL injection vulnerability was found in the 'add\_company.php' file of the 'Bookstore Management System PHP MySQL Project' project. The reason for this issue is that attackers inject malicious code from the parameter 'delete' and use it directly in SQL queries without the need for appropriate cleaning or validation. This allows attackers to forge input values, thereby manipulating SQL queries and performing unauthorized operations. * Impact   Attackers can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to achieve unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption, posing a serious threat to system security and business continuity.  DESCRIPTION  * During the security review of "Bookstore Management System PHP MySQL Project", 蓝翔技校王主任 discovered a critical SQL injection vulnerability in the "add\_company.php" file. This vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation of the 'delete' parameter, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL queries. Therefore, attackers can gain unauthorized access to databases, modify or delete data, and access sensitive information. Immediate remedial measures are needed to ensure system security and protect data integrity.  No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerabilityVulnerability details and POC  * Vulnerability type   time-based blind * Vulnerability location   'delete' parameter * Payload  ``` Parameter: delete (GET)     Type: time-based blind     Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)     Payload: delete=1') AND (SELECT 5107 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))ZUWU) AND ('zzFj'='zzFj  ```  * The following are screenshots of some specific information obtained from testing and running with the sqlmap tool    `python .\sqlmap.py -u "http://127.0.0.1/Placement/add_company.php?delete=1" --dbs`   [image](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/75243477/395937280-0e4d1325-1efa-4ffa-b92e-aef1cf42b541.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.QPyv9C61QxXxgemTvcX1q-68PWZff6vau8tVcwOV5TI)  Suggested repair  1. Use prepared statements and parameter binding:    Preparing statements can prevent SQL injection as they separate SQL code from user input data. When using prepare statements, the value entered by the user is treated as pure data and will not be interpreted as SQL code. 2. Input validation and filtering:    Strictly validate and filter user input data to ensure it conforms to the expected format. 3. Minimize database user permissions:    Ensure that the account used to connect to the database has the minimum necessary permissions. Avoid using accounts with advanced permissions (such as' root 'or' admin ') for daily operations. 4. Regular security audits:    Regularly conduct code and system security audits to promptly identify and fix potential security vulnerabilities. |

* At first look, we can say that Bookstore Management System is a perfect system but it has many limitations that are as follow :
* This is also used to list the category and books also manage the customer and books of the Bookstore.
* The Bookstore Management System is used to give information about the Books to the customer.
* We faced problems like Database creation, the Flow of our system, designing front-end and back-end tools, coding, etc.
* Only a single user can use a system at a time.
* In this system, we cannot add a service module.
* We learned new languages like jQuery, PHP, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, etc.

# Limitation of system
