- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This lack of proper access control allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control. The plugin does not properly restrict access to certain functions or actions, leading to the potential for unauthorized execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user can execute certain higher privileged actions. The specific impact will vary depending on the vulnerable function within the plugin.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker does not need any authentication or special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
