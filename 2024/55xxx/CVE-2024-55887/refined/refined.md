- **Root cause of vulnerability:** XML parsing performed by the `UcumEssenceService` is vulnerable to XML external entity (XXE) injections.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** XXE vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious XML file with a DTD tag can be processed, allowing the retrieval of data from the host system. This impacts scenarios where `ucum` is used within a host where external clients can submit XML data.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable by submitting a malicious XML file to the `UcumEssenceService`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to submit arbitrary XML to the application.

The provided content is a security advisory for the `ucum-java` library, detailing an XXE vulnerability. It includes CVSS v3 base metrics with a high severity score.
