Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-55104

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization on the 'gender' and 'emailid' parameters within the `add-nurse.php` file of the Online Nurse Hiring System v1.0. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, specifically on the `gender` and `emailid` parameters of the `add-nurse.php` script. This occurs because user-supplied data is directly incorporated into a SQL query without sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can bypass authentication mechanisms by injecting malicious SQL, gaining unauthorized access to the database.
- **Sensitive Information Extraction:** Through SQL injection, an attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the database, such as usernames, passwords, personal information of nurses and users.
- **Data Modification or Deletion:** Depending on database permissions, an attacker might modify or delete data within the database.
- **Arbitrary SQL execution:** The attacker can execute any arbitrary sql commands on the database server by leveraging sql injection.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `/onhs/admin/add-nurse.php` file. The payload containing the SQL injection is injected within the `gender` parameter's value, using multi-part form data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- No specific user privileges are required beyond the ability to send HTTP requests.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates a SQL injection using a `load_file` function to verify the presence of the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The system uses MD5 encryption method for passwords. However, this is not the vulnerability itself.
- The application is written in PHP and uses MySQL database.

This analysis is based on the provided content, which includes the vulnerability description, a PoC and also includes details about the application the vulnerability is found in.
