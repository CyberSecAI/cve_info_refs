- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute a higher-privileged action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken access control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user can execute actions intended for higher-privileged users. The specific impact will vary depending on the context.
- **Attack vectors:** Not explicitly defined, but it involves exploiting a function that lacks proper access control mechanisms.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a "Subscriber" level user or lower.
