- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `id` parameter in the `delete.php` component before using it in an SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `delete.php` component due to the lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to data leakage, privilege escalation, or complete database compromise, potentially resulting in privilege escalation or arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `id` parameter in the `delete.php` component, by sending a crafted HTTP request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable `delete.php` endpoint, which is available at `http://localhost/admin/delete.php`.
