|  |  |
|  | ## \*\*Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) Vulnerability\*\* |
|  |  |
|  | --- |
|  |  |
|  | ### \*\*Description\*\* |
|  | An \*\*Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)\*\* vulnerability was discovered in the application, version \*\*6.0.0\*\*, that allows a logged-in user to access the inbox messages of other users by manipulating the \*\*notification\_id\*\* parameter in the request URL. This issue arises due to insufficient authorization checks, enabling attackers to view sensitive mail details belonging to other users, resulting in unauthorized information disclosure and privacy violations. |
|  |  |
|  | --- |
|  |  |
|  | ### \*\*Details\*\* |
|  | The `/api/Notification/<notification\_id>` endpoint fails to validate user authorization properly, allowing users to modify the \*\*notification\_id\*\* parameter and access the messages of other users. This results in unauthorized access to private data by changing the notification ID in the request URL, potentially exposing confidential information. |
|  |  |
|  | - \*\*Affected Version:\*\* |
|  | Application Version \*\*6.0.0\*\* |
|  |  |
|  | - \*\*Affected Endpoint:\*\* |
|  | `/api/Notification/<notification\_id>` |
|  |  |
|  | - \*\*Vulnerable Parameter:\*\* |
|  | `notification\_id` |
|  |  |
|  | By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can bypass authorization checks and view messages of other users, compromising user privacy and confidentiality. |
|  |  |
|  | --- |
|  |  |
|  | ### \*\*Steps to Reproduce\*\* |
|  |  |
|  | 1. \*\*Log in as a Normal User\*\* |
|  | Log in as any valid user and navigate to your profile. |
|  |  |
|  | 2. \*\*Navigate to the "Notification" Section\*\* |
|  | Go to the "Notification" section of your account. |
|  |  |
|  | 3. \*\*View a Notification\*\* |
|  | Click on a notification to view its details. The request URL will look like this: |
|  |  |
|  | Use the following example to fetch user's notification detail (e.g., User Bob's data): |
|  | ```http |
|  | GET http://localhost:5000/api/Notification/124 |
|  |  |
|  | 4. \*\*Modify the `notification\_id` Parameter\*\* |
|  | Change the `notification\_id` parameter in the URL to access other users' notifications: |
|  |  |
|  | Use the following example to fetch another user's notification detail (e.g., User Alice's data): |
|  | ```http |
|  | GET http://localhost:5000/api/Notification/12 |
|  |  |
|  | 5. \*\*Observe the Server Response\*\* |
|  | The modified URLs return mail details of other users, despite not having the proper authorization. |
|  |  |
|  | --- |
|  |  |
|  | ### \*\*Impact\*\* |
|  | - \*\*Impact on Users:\*\* |
|  | Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive mail information of other users. |
|  |  |
|  | - \*\*Impact on the Application:\*\* |
|  | - Privacy violations leading to potential data breaches. |
|  | - Increased risk of information exposure. |
|  | - Possible damage to user trust and reputational harm. |
|  | - Potential regulatory non-compliance issues due to unauthorized access to sensitive data. |
|  |  |
|  | --- |
|  |  |
|  | ### \*\*Recommendations\*\* |
|  |  |
|  | - \*\*Enforce Robust Authorization Checks:\*\* |
|  | Implement proper server-side validation to ensure that users can only access their own data, preventing unauthorized access based on URL manipulation. |
|  |  |
|  | - \*\*Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):\*\* |
|  | Ensure that only users with the appropriate permissions can view certain notifications or other users' data. |
|  |  |
|  | - \*\*Sanitize and Validate Input Parameters:\*\* |
|  | Always validate and sanitize parameters like `notification\_id` to ensure they correspond to the logged-in user's data. |
|  |  |
|  | - \*\*Audit Logs and Monitoring:\*\* |
|  | Implement logging mechanisms to track unauthorized access attempts and enable real-time detection of suspicious activities. |
|  |  |
|  | For more details about securing access controls, refer to: |
|  | [OWASP: Broken Access Control](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Broken\_Access\_Control) |
|  |  |
|  | --- |
|  |  |
|  | This vulnerability falls under \*\*Broken Access Control (A01:2021)\*\* in the \*\*OWASP Top 10\*\*. |
