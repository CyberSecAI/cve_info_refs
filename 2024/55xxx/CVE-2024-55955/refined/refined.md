- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An incorrect permissions assignment vulnerability in Trend Micro Deep Security 20.0 agents. Specifically, an uncontrolled search path element (CWE-427).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect permissions assignment leading to a local privilege escalation vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker can escalate privileges on affected installations.
- **Attack vectors**: Local attacker needs to be able to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system. The attacker also needs to have access (physical or remote) to a vulnerable machine.
