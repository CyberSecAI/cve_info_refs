### @CSIRTTrizna **[CSIRTTrizna](/CSIRTTrizna)** commented [Dec 10, 2024](#issue-2729883738)

## Description

The `ZipFile` `extract` and `extractall` methods in `libarchive` are vulnerable to a directory traversal attack, allowing files to be written anywhere on disk, regardless of the intended target path.

This vulnerability stems from line 107 in `libarchive/zip.py`:

```
return self.readpath(name, os.path.join(path, name))
```

Here, `os.path.join` combines unsanitized user input (`name`) with the intended extraction path, making the method susceptible to malicious input.

Our fork addresses this issue by implementing the `sanitize_filename` method, which incorporates logic from the `pyzipper` project, a well-tested and secure solution.

Additionally, we have added docstrings to enhance code readability and maintainability.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Descritpion The `extract` and `extractall` methods in the `ZipFile` class are vulnerable to directory traversal attacks, allowing files to be written anywhere on disk, regardless of the target path specified by the developer. Detailed description of the vulnerability is available on our webpage: Proof of Concept If we create zip archive with following code:  ``` import pyzipper import time  with pyzipper.ZipFile("exploit.zip", 'w', compression=pyzipper.ZIP_LZMA) as zf:     zip_info = zf.zipinfo_cls(filename="/tmp/vulnerable.txt", date_time=time.localtime(time.time())[:6])     zf.writestr(zip_info, "vulnerable") ```  Then we can extract the created archive using extractall method:  ``` from libarchive.zip import ZipFile  with ZipFile("exploit.zip",  mode="r") as archive:     archive.extractall(path="./") ```  After extracting the archive using the `extractall` method, the `vulnerable.txt` file will be created in the `/tmp` directory with the contents "vulnerable". Possible Impact This vulnerability can be exploited, for example, to overwrite the `authorized_keys` file in a user's home directory, enabling an attacker to connect to the affected server via SSH. Summary Fix for this vulnerability is available in pull request [#41](https://github.com/smartfile/python-libarchive/pull/41) , containing additional filename sanitization. |
