- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute higher privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unprivileged users can execute actions that are intended for higher privileged users. The specific impact varies depending on the specific function being targeted by the exploit.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a malicious request to a vulnerable function in the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
