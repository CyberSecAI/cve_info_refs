Great plug in. Light weight, simple, easy to use, does a lot but doesn’t try to do too much. It knows what it’s for and it does it’s job extremely well. After trying a bunch of these, I settled on this, and so far, so good.

As for the use of the plugin, I already loved … It’s simple but also very complete !! But unfortunately for me the possibility to export and import the settings, thus making it easier to migrate to other sites or backup.

Hi All,

WordPress Plugin “My WP Customize Admin/Frontend” updated to 1.24.1. 🙂

This update includes security updates so I recommend update to it.

## Update overview

* Updated: For WordPress 6.7.
* Changed: How to get the wp version and offset seconds.
* Changed: Late include the JS and CSS on admin and frontend and login.
* Fixed: Escape and sanitize the some values.

### Updated: For WordPress 6.7.

In WordPress 6.7, it was not possible to customize the image of the login screen, so I have fixed this.

### Changed: How to get the wp version and offset seconds.

The method of obtaining [get the WordPress version](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_get_wp_version/) and time calculation(gmt\_offset) has changed since WordPress 6.7, so the method of obtaining the version has been changed.

### Changed: Late include the JS and CSS on admin and frontend and login.

Late include the JS and CSS priority (to 9999) for other plugins and themes customization.

### Fixed: Escape and sanitize the some values.

Some items had an XSS vulnerability, so I fixed it.
