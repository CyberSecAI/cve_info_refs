Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `select` filter within the `report-filters.js` file. This filter allows accessing arbitrary properties of an object, including its prototype properties. Specifically, it doesn't restrict access to "own properties" and allows access to the `constructor` property, leading to access to the `Function` constructor. This allows execution of arbitrary code by crafting a malicious template.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** The primary weakness is the ability to inject malicious code into the template processing logic via the `select` filter.
*   **Insecure Property Access:** The `select` filter in `report-filters.js` is not restricted to only accessing "own properties" of an object. It can access prototype properties and allows access to `constructor`.
*   **JavaScript Sandbox Escape:** By accessing the `Function` constructor, the attacker can escape the intended JavaScript sandbox and execute arbitrary code.
*   **Missing input validation:** The vulnerability is also exacerbated by a lack of sufficient validation of the template extension, which could allow to bypass other security measures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the pwndoc application. This could allow for complete system compromise.
*   **Data Confidentiality and Integrity Breach:** Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to access and modify sensitive data stored on the server.
*   **Service Disruption:** The attacker may also be able to disrupt the availability of the pwndoc service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Document Templates:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious document (e.g. docx) template that includes the vulnerable expression in the template.
*   **Template Upload:** The attacker needs to upload the malicious template through the pwndoc interface. This is done through the `/data/templates` endpoint, which is only available to admin users by default, but could be made available to other roles in an insecure configuration.
*   **Template Rendering:** When a report is generated using this malicious template, the injected code will be executed by the server during the rendering process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Admin access:** To upload or modify templates, an attacker would require, by default, admin privileges on the Pwndoc application.
*   **Template Creation Knowledge:** The attacker must be aware of the template engine, the way filters work and how to write malicious expressions to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the pwndoc server to upload the malicious template and trigger the exploitation.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to craft a malicious template that executes the `id` command on the server.
*   The vulnerability is tracked as **CVE-2024-55652** and **GHSA-jw5r-6927-hwpc**.
*   The fix includes changes to validate the file extension upon upload/modification, as can be seen in the provided commit, which mitigates an additional attack vector but does not address the root cause.
