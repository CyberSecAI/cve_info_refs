Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-55662:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the `Extension Repository Application` of XWiki. Specifically, user-provided content within the description, summary, and installation instructions fields of extension objects was not properly escaped before being rendered. This allowed the injection of malicious code through XWiki scripting macros (like `{{groovy}}`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Unsanitized input allows execution of arbitrary code on the server by injecting and executing XWiki scripting macros.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization/Escaping:** The core issue is the lack of proper sanitization or escaping of user-supplied data in multiple fields related to extension objects, including description, summary, and installation instructions.
*   **Privilege Escalation**: Normal users without `script` or `programming` rights were able to execute code requiring such rights.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Full Server Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the XWiki server process. This can lead to complete control over the server, including data theft, modification, and denial of service.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The CVSS score indicates high impact to confidentiality, integrity and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
*   **Web Interface:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability through the web interface of the XWiki application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker only needs a user account on the vulnerable XWiki instance, without special permissions such as `script` or `programming` rights.
*   **Access to Extension Repository Application:** The `Extension Repository Application` must be installed and enabled on the XWiki instance.
*   **Ability to add an object of type `ExtensionCode.ExtensionClass`**: An attacker needs to be able to create/edit extension objects and fill in the vulnerable fields.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by inserting malicious XWiki scripting code like `{{async}}{{groovy}}println("Hello from Description"){{/groovy}}{{/async}}` into fields such as description, summary and installation instructions.
*   The fix involves escaping user-provided content using `$services.rendering.escape($value, 'xwiki/2.1')` before rendering it.
*   The vulnerable code is present in `ExtensionCode.ExtensionSheet` and `ExtensionCode.ExtensionAuthorsDisplayer` pages.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in XWiki versions 15.10.9 and 16.3.0.

**CWEs:**

*   **CWE-96:** Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Generated Code ('Dynamic Code Injection')
*   **CWE-863:** Incorrect Authorization

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes commit diffs which show the specific code changes to address the vulnerability which involves using the `$services.rendering.escape` to escape user provided content before rendering in the UI.
*   The issue was tracked in XWiki's Jira as XWIKI-21890.
