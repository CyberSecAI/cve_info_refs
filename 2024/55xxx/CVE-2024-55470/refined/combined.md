[**Authentication Bypass Vulnerability.md**](#file-authentication-bypass-vulnerability-md)

# Authentication Bypass Vulnerability

---

## Description

An **Authentication Bypass** vulnerability was discovered in the **Oqtane Framework**, version **6.0.0**. The vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive user information by exploiting the **entityid** parameter in the `/api/Setting` endpoint. This issue arises due to insufficient server-side validation of authentication and authorization, enabling attackers to retrieve sensitive user details or escalate privileges.

---

## Details

The `/api/Setting` endpoint fails to enforce adequate access control mechanisms. Specifically, it does not validate user authentication and authorization, allowing attackers to manipulate the **entityid** parameter to access restricted data or perform unauthorized actions.

* **Affected Version**:

  Oqtane Framework Version **6.0.0**
* **Affected Endpoint**:

  `/api/Setting?entityname=User&entityid=<ID>`
* **Vulnerable Parameter**:

  `entityid`

By exploiting this vulnerability, attackers can bypass authentication, retrieve sensitive data of any user, and escalate their privileges. This is due to the application's reliance on client-side data for authentication instead of enforcing robust server-side validation.

---

## **Steps to Reproduce**

1. **Start the Application**

   Launch the application and log in as any valid user.
2. **Navigate to the Profile Section**

   Access the user profile section to observe normal application behavior.
3. **Send a GET Request with Valid Authentication**

   Use the following example to fetch user data (e.g., User Kaushik's data):

   ```
   GET http://localhost:5000/api/Setting?entityname=User&entityid=4
   ```
4. **Remove Authentication Cookies**

   Clear all authentication cookies and session tokens.
5. **Modify the `entityid` Parameter**

   Bypass authentication by changing the `entityid` parameter to access data of other users or escalate privileges:

   ```
   GET http://localhost:5000/api/Setting?entityname=User&entityid=1
   ```

   Examples:

   * Change `entityid=1` to `entityid=2` or `entityid=3`.
   * Continue modifying the parameter to retrieve additional user information.
6. **Observe the Server Response**

   Despite the lack of valid authentication, sensitive user details are disclosed.

---

## **Impact**

* **Impact on Users:**

  + Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal information.
* **Impact on the Application:**

  + Increased risk of data breaches, privacy violations, and regulatory non-compliance.
  + Potential reputational damage and loss of user trust.

---

## **Recommendations**

* **Enforce Robust Authentication and Authorization:**

  Implement server-side validation to verify the authentication state of the requesting user.
* **Implement Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC):**

  Restrict access to sensitive data based on the user’s roles and permissions.
* **Sanitize and Validate Input Parameters:**

  Validate all input parameters, especially the `entityid` parameter, to ensure they are legitimate and authorized for the requesting user.
* **Audit Logs and Monitoring:**

  Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect and prevent unauthorized access attempts.
