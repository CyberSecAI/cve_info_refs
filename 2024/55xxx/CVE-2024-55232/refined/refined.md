Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-55232

**Description:**
An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability exists in the `manage-notes.php` module of PHPGurukul Online Notes Sharing Management System v1.0. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to delete notes belonging to other accounts due to missing authorization checks.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The application lacks proper authorization checks when handling note deletion requests. This means that an attacker can manipulate the `delid` parameter in the URL to delete notes associated with another user's account without having the necessary permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The system directly uses the note ID provided in the request parameter (`delid`) to identify the note to be deleted without verifying if the logged-in user is authorized to delete that specific note.
*   **Missing Authorization Checks:** There are no checks to confirm that the user making the delete request is the owner of the note.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to delete notes belonging to other users. This can lead to:
    *   **Data Loss:** Users may lose valuable information stored as notes.
    *   **Service Disruption:**  The application's functionality is impacted as user's ability to store their notes is not available.
    *   **Loss of Integrity:** The attacker can arbitrarily alter the system's data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Manipulation:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by modifying the `delid` parameter in the URL request.
*   **Captured Delete Links:** The attacker could also capture a delete link associated with a victim's account, such as by social engineering or by inspecting network traffic, and use it to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid User Account:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account in the system.
*   **Knowledge of Target Note ID:** The attacker needs to know the note ID (`delid`) of the note they want to delete. This could be obtained through social engineering, prior access to a victim's account or, more likely, by observing the id's of the notes they themselves have created, allowing the attacker to try other id's.

**PoC:**
The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the attack:
1.  Attacker logs in with their account (e.g., `hacker@gmail.com`).
2.  Attacker gains access to a delete link associated with a victim's account (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1/user/manage-notes.php?delid=20`).
3.  While still logged in as the attacker, they modify the `delid` parameter in the link (if needed) and submit the request.
4.  When the victim (e.g., `victim@gmail.com`) logs back in, it is confirmed that their note with ID 20 has been deleted by the attacker.
