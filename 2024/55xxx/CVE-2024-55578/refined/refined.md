Based on the provided advisory, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The Zammad application was logging sensitive configuration settings, including tokens, secrets, and passwords, in plain text to log files when these settings were changed or reset.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive data, including API keys, passwords and other secrets were logged in plain text.
    *   **Inadequate Logging Practices:** Logging mechanisms did not filter out sensitive information.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Exposure of Credentials:** Attackers who gain access to the logs (via file system access, backup access, or systems consuming the logs) could obtain sensitive credentials.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:**  Compromised credentials could lead to unauthorized access to the Zammad system, linked services, or other connected systems and accounts.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Log File Access:** Attackers could gain access to log files on the Zammad server via local or remote file system access or through access to systems consuming the log data.
    *  **Backup Access:** Attackers could obtain sensitive information from backups containing the log files.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to gain access to the Zammad serverâ€™s log files, backups, or any system consuming this log data.
    *   No specific user privileges are required beyond what is needed to access the logs.
