### @myndzi **[myndzi](/myndzi)** commented [Nov 26, 2024](#issue-2692689562)

When nanoid is called with a fractional value, there were a number of undesirable effects:

* in browser and non-secure, the code infinite loops on `while (size--)`
* in node, the value of poolOffset becomes fractional, causing calls to nanoid to return zeroes until the pool is next filled: when `i` is initialized to `poolOffset`, `pool[i] & 63` -> `undefined & 63` -> `0`
* if the first call in node is a fractional argument, the initial buffer allocation fails with an error

I chose `|0` to cast to a signed integer primarily because that has a slightly better outcome in the third case above: if the first call is negative (e.g. `nanoid(-1)`) then Node will throw an error for an invalid Buffer size, rather than attempting to allocate a buffer of size `2**32-1`. It's also more compact than `>>>0`, which would be necessary to cast to an unsigned integer. I don't *think* there is a use case for generating ids longer than `2**31-1` :)

The browser code is structured in such a way that casting `size` in `customRandom` succinctly isn't readily feasible. I chose to cast it at the line `let j = step | 0` since casting defaultSize would not fix the infinite loop in all cases, and the other use of defaultSize is to define the step length which is already shown to be fractional and gets cast to an integer with `~` anyway.

As for the `nanoid` function, `new Uint8Array(size)` ignores the fractional part, and `size` doesn't get used further - the function instead calls reduce over the typed array.

In the Node/native async customAlphabet variant, I chose to convert the `id.length === size` check to `id.length >= size`, which handles the fractional case and avoids the infinite loop; `size` is not used for anything else there.

Sorry, something went wrong.

1. [Fix pool pollution, infinite loop (](/ai/nanoid/commit/d643045f40d6dc8afa000a644d857da1436ed08c)[#510](https://github.com/ai/nanoid/pull/510)[)](/ai/nanoid/commit/d643045f40d6dc8afa000a644d857da1436ed08c)
    …

   ```
   * Fix pool pollution, infinite loop

   When nanoid is called with a fractional value, there were a number
   of undesirable effects:
   - in browser and non-secure, the code infinite loops on `while (size--)`
   - in node, the value of poolOffset becomes fractional, causing calls to
     nanoid to return zeroes until the pool is next filled: when `i` is
     initialized to `poolOffset`, `pool[i] & 63` -> `undefined & 63` -> `0`
   - if the first call in node is a fractional argument, the initial buffer
     allocation fails with an error

   I chose `|0` to cast to a signed integer primarily because that has a
   slightly better outcome in the third case above: if the first call is
   negative (e.g. `nanoid(-1)`) then Node will throw an error for an
   invalid Buffer size, rather than attempting to allocate a buffer of
   size `2**32-1`. It's also more compact than `>>>0`, which would be
   necessary to cast to an unsigned integer. I don't _think_ there is
   a use case for generating ids longer than `2**31-1` :)

   The browser code is structured in such a way that casting `size` in
   `customRandom` succinctly isn't readily feasible. I chose to cast it
   at the line `let j = step | 0` since casting defaultSize would not
   fix the infinite loop in all cases, and the other use of defaultSize
   is to define the step length which is already shown to be fractional
   and gets cast to an integer with `~` anyway.

   As for the `nanoid` function, `new Uint8Array(size)` ignores the
   fractional part, and `size` doesn't get used further - the function
   instead calls reduce over the typed array.

   In the Node/native async customAlphabet variant, I chose to convert
   the `id.length === size` check to `id.length >= size`, which handles
   the fractional case and avoids the infinite loop; `size` is not used
   for anything else there.

   * `const` -> `let`
   ```
