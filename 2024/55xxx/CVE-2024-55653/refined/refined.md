- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application's backend does not handle promise rejections properly in asynchronous functions, specifically in the `audit.js` route. When a promise is rejected without a corresponding `.catch()` or error handler, it leads to an `UnhandledPromiseRejection` which causes the backend to crash.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of error handling in asynchronous functions within the audit route. Specifically, the identified vulnerable endpoints within `backend/src/routes/audit.js` lack proper error handling for promise rejections.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, rendering the application unusable for all users due to the backend crashing.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks, where an attacker sends malicious HTTP requests to specific API endpoints.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker must be an authenticated user with the ability to make API requests. The attacker doesn't need to know a valid audit ID, as the vulnerability can be triggered with a bad ID as well.
