Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper authorization and validation of SQL queries in Apache Superset's SQLLab. Specifically, the system incorrectly identifies certain SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements as read-only queries when they are not.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect read-only query validation in SQLLab.
- Vulnerability exists only in Postgres analytic databases which don't have a read-only user.
- Allows execution of arbitrary SQL DML statements when it shouldn't be possible under read-only constraints.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with SQLLab access can execute SQL DML statements, such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, even if they are intended to have read-only access.
- This could lead to unauthorized data modification, data deletion, or potentially other malicious actions on the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to have access to SQLLab in Apache Superset.
- The attacker crafts a SQL DML statement specifically designed to bypass the read-only check.
- This attack is limited to Postgres analytic database connections, which do not have a read-only user configured for the database connection in Superset.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have an account with access to Apache Superset's SQLLab.
- The attacker must target a Postgres analytic database connection without a configured read-only user.
