Improper Authorization vulnerability in Apache Superset. On Postgres analytic databases an attacker with SQLLab access can craft a specially designed SQL DML statement that is Incorrectly identified as a read-only query, enabling its execution. Non postgres analytics database connections and postgres analytics database connections set with a readonly user (advised) are not vulnerable. 

This issue affects Apache Superset: before 4.1.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.1.0, which fixes the issue.
