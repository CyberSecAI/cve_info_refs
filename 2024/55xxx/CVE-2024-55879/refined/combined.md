#### Description

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. Login as a user with script right.
2. Edit your user profile (or any other editable page) and add an object of type "XWiki.ConfigurableClass" ("Custom configurable sections").
3. Set "Display in section" to "other".
4. Set "Heading" to
   ```
    #set($codeToExecute = 'Test') #set($codeToExecuteResult = '{{async}}{{groovy}}services.logging.getLogger("attacker").error("Attack from Heading succeeded!"); println("Hello from Groovy!"){{/groovy}}{{/async}}') My Heading $app.getRenderedContent('{{groovy}}println("Hello from rendered content!"){{/groovy}}', 'xwiki/2.1')
   ```
5. Set "Display in Category" to "other"
6. Set "Scope" to "Wiki and all spaces"
7. Click "Save"
8. Open <xwiki-host>/xwiki/bin/view/Main/?sheet=XWiki.AdminSheet&viewer=content&editor=globaladmin&section=other where <xwiki-host> is the URL of your XWiki installation.

**Expected result:**

No error log is displayed, some error is displayed for the heading that Groovy execution isn't allowed.

**Actual result:**

"My Heading <p>Hello from rendered content!</p>" is displayed as heading, the content below says "Hello from Groovy!" and a lock message "Attack from Heading succeeded!" is displayed. This shows that the Groovy code has been executed. Note that this is with all fixes from [~~XWIKI-21121~~](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-21121 "Remote code execution/programming rights through heading of configuration sections with edit rights") applied, before that no script right was necessary.

This issue exploits XWIKI-21192 and might be fixed when XWIKI-21192 has been fixed but this could also be fixed independently by executing the heading's Velocity code more securely.

# SQL injection in getdocuments.vm with sort parameter

Critical

[manuelleduc](/manuelleduc)
published
GHSA-wh34-m772-5398
Dec 12, 2024

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-distribution-war
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 6.3-milestone-2

## Patched versions

13.10.5, 14.3-rc-1

## Description

### Impact

In `getdocument.vm` ; the ordering of the returned documents is defined from an unsanitized request parameter (request.sort) and can allow any user to inject HQL.

Depending on the used database backend, the attacker may be able to not only obtain confidential information such as password hashes from the database, but also execute UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE queries.

It's possible to employ database backend dependent techniques of breaking out of HQL query context, described, for example, here: <https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/exploiting-hibernate-injections>.

### Patches

This has been patched in 13.10.5 and 14.3-rc-1.

### Workarounds

There is no known workaround, other than upgrading XWiki.

### References

<https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-17568>

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

# RCE from script right in configurable sections

Critical

published
GHSA-r279-47wg-chpr
Dec 12, 2024

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-administration-ui
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

## Patched versions

15.10.9

## Description

### Impact

Any user with script rights can perform arbitrary remote code execution by adding instances of `XWiki.ConfigurableClass` to any page. This compromises the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation.

To reproduce on a instance, as a user with script rights, edit your user profile and add an object of type `XWiki.ConfigurableClass` ("Custom configurable sections").

Set "Display in section" and "Display in category" to `other`, "Scope" to `Wiki and all spaces` and "Heading" to:

```
#set($codeToExecute = 'Test') #set($codeToExecuteResult = '{{async}}{{groovy}}services.logging.getLogger("attacker").error("Attack from Heading succeeded!"){{/groovy}}{{/async}}')

```

Save the page and view it, then add `?sheet=XWiki.AdminSheet&viewer=content&section=other` to the URL.

If the logs contain "attacker - Attack from Heading succeeded!", then the instance is vulnerable.

### Patches

This has been patched in XWiki 15.10.9 and 16.3.0.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
