http4k is a functional toolkit for Kotlin HTTP applications. Prior to version 5.41.0.0, there is a potential XXE (XML External Entity Injection) vulnerability when http4k handling malicious XML contents within requests, which might allow attackers to read local sensitive information on server, trigger Server-side Request Forgery and even execute code under some circumstances. Version 5.41.0.0 contains a patch for the issue.
