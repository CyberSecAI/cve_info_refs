- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize user input in the profile name field on the `/user/certificate-form.php` page, allowing injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript on the client side, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into the profile name field on the `/user/certificate-form.php` page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application.
