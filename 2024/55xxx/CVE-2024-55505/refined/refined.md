Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-55505

**Description:**

The vulnerability is present in CodeAstro Complaint Management System v.1.0. It's an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability that allows an attacker with engineer-level privileges to access and view complaint tickets assigned to other engineers.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The application fails to properly validate user authorization when accessing complaint tickets. Specifically, the `message-view.php` script uses the `id` parameter directly from the URL to fetch the complaint ticket without verifying if the currently logged-in engineer is authorized to view it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The application uses direct object references (the `id` parameter) without proper access controls.
*   **Lack of Authorization Checks:** The application does not verify whether an engineer has the necessary permissions to view a specific complaint ticket.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can access and view sensitive complaint information not intended for them. This compromises the confidentiality of the data.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Although the attacker does not gain admin-level access, they are able to access data that they are not authorized to access by manipulating the object ID.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface of the application.
*   **URL Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `id` parameter in the URL (`message-view.php?id=`) to access tickets not assigned to them.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Engineer Account:** The attacker needs an engineer account. They can either have existing credentials or can create a new one, as the application allows account creation with engineer-level access.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application.
*   **Basic Understanding of Web Requests:** The attacker must understand how to modify URL parameters.
