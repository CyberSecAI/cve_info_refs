- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The production server is misconfigured and is missing Content Security Policy (CSP) and other security headers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Absence of security headers including Strict-Transport-Security, Content-Security-Policy, Permission Policy, Referrer-Policy, X-XSS-Protection, X-Frame-Options, and X-Content-Type-Options. This lack of security headers makes the application vulnerable to a wide array of attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: If XSS filters are bypassed, the absence of security headers exposes the application to a variety of attacks, including cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and other client-side vulnerabilities. There is potential for unauthorized access to data, data modification, and service disruption.
- **Attack vectors**: Network based attacks through exploiting the lack of security headers in the server response.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require any privileges. User interaction is required in the form of the victim visiting a malicious link or website.
