Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-55546:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the device's web interface, specifically in the "device properties" settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The device is vulnerable to stored XSS, which allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is persistently stored on the device. This code is executed in the context of any user's browser when they access the relevant page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker can execute arbitrary code within the victim's browser, potentially leading to:
    - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing cookies or session tokens to impersonate the user.
    - **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive information visible on the page.
    - **Malicious Actions:** Performing actions on behalf of the victim, such as modifying settings or redirecting them to malicious websites.
    - **Full Control of the device:** Taking control over the device by tricking an authenticated admin into doing an action.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attacker injects the malicious JavaScript code through the device's web interface.
- **Device Settings:** Specifically, the injection occurs in the "device properties" settings (e.g., device name, location, description).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker requires authenticated access to the device's web interface to modify the device properties settings.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Input Fields:** The attacker must identify the specific input fields that are vulnerable to XSS.
- **Ability to inject JavaScript:** the attacker must be able to insert and save malicious JavaScript code.

**Additional Details**

- The vulnerability was discovered by students at UAS St. PÃ¶lten during a lecture by CyberDanube, using the MEDUSA scalable firmware runtime.
- The vulnerable device is the ORing IAP-420 with firmware version 2.01e.
- There is no solution from the vendor and the recommendation is to change the hardware.
- There is no workaround available, restricting network and management interface access is the only current mitigation.
