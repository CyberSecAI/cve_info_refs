Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-1040:

**Vulnerability:** Use of a Weak Hash (CWE-328)

**Root Cause:** The Gessler GmbH WEB-MASTER system stores user account passwords using a weak hashing algorithm.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Weak Hashing Algorithm:** The specific algorithm is not mentioned, but it's identified as insufficient for secure password storage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Password Recovery:** An attacker who gains access to the device can extract the password hashes and then crack them to recover the original passwords.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** This could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable with local access to the device. The CVSS vector string `AV:L` indicates that the attack vector is local.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **High Privileges:** The attacker requires high privileges to access the stored password hashes on the device. This is indicated by `PR:H` in the CVSS vector.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is distinct from CVE-2024-1039, which involves the use of weak, hardcoded credentials in the same product.
*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 4.4, which is lower than the score for CVE-2024-1039, reflecting the need for local access and high privileges.
*   The advisory recommends updating to specific versions of EZ2 and WebMaster to mitigate both vulnerabilities.
