- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A custom role with `manage_group_access_tokens` permission, based on the `Guest` role, allows users to create Group Access Tokens (GATs) with the `Owner` role, regardless of their own lower access level.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Privilege escalation vulnerability. Improper access control, allowing a user with limited privileges to create tokens with higher privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A low-privileged user can escalate their privileges to `Owner` within a group by creating a GAT with owner access. This allows the attacker to perform actions as an owner.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through both the UI and the REST API by creating group access tokens.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to have a custom role assigned with `manage_group_access_tokens` permission and based on the `Guest` role.
    - The attacker must be a member of the group they wish to escalate privileges in.
