The provided content describes a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in a Product Management System. This vulnerability is present in the `/supplier.php` and `/endpoint/add_supplier.php` files of the system.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `supplier_name` and `supplier_contact` parameters. This allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code into the database.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Reflected XSS: The system does not sanitize user-supplied input before storing it into the database and later displaying it. This allows the execution of malicious JavaScript when the data is displayed in a user's browser.
*   Hardcoded Credentials: The system's administrator account and password are hardcoded in the source code, making it easily accessible to attackers.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into the database. When a victim (including administrator) accesses pages displaying the injected data (e.g., supplier details), the malicious script is executed in their browser.
*   This could lead to various attacks such as session hijacking, cookie theft, redirecting users to malicious websites, defacement of website, or other malicious actions.
*   Due to the presence of hardcoded credentials, attackers can gain full access to the application.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the `supplier_name` and `supplier_contact` parameters in the `/supplier.php` and `/endpoint/add_supplier.php` files. An attacker crafts a malicious input containing JavaScript code and submits it through these parameters. The data with the malicious script will be stored in the database. When the affected pages display the injected data, the browser will execute the script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to have access to the vulnerable system.
*   They need the ability to manipulate the vulnerable parameters of the system which would include being able to submit data to it, typically by using a web browser or similar HTTP request tool.
*   Knowledge of the hardcoded administrator credentials is required to login to the system to inject malicious data into the database using the vulnerable parameters.
