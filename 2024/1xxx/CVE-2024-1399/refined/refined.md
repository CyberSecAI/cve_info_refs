- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the plugin's shortcodes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the affected page. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as redirecting users to malicious sites, stealing cookies, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs through the plugin's shortcodes. An attacker injects malicious code as an attribute value of the shortcode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with contributor-level permissions or higher. This allows them to create or edit posts/pages and add the malicious shortcode with injected scripts.
