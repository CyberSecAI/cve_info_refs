- Root cause of vulnerability: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists when the user pastes a crafted string into the registration key field.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Buffer overflow
- Impact of exploitation: Denial of Service (DoS)
- Attack vectors: User needs to copy the content of the generated file (`exp.txt`) to the registration key field.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application's registration key input. They need to be able to copy the generated exploit string and paste it into the registration key field.
