Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-1069

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient file validation in the `view_page` function within the Contact Form Entries plugin. Specifically, the plugin fails to properly check the file extension of uploaded files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** The primary weakness is the ability to upload files of any type, including those with potentially dangerous extensions.
- **Lack of File Extension Validation:** The plugin does not sufficiently validate the file extension, allowing for the bypass of security measures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts), an attacker can potentially gain the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to a complete compromise of the affected website.
- **Website Defacement:** An attacker could upload files to deface the website.
- **Data Breach:** An attacker might gain access to sensitive data or the website's database.
- **Malware Distribution:** An attacker can upload malware to infect website visitors.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker uploads files through a form submission, likely via an HTTP POST request, using a vulnerable file upload mechanism.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator or have administrator-level capabilities or higher on the WordPress site.
- **Access to Admin Panel:** The attacker needs to access to the WordPress admin panel.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `view_page` function within the `includes/plugin-pages.php` file of the plugin.
- The vulnerable code was located around line 1213 of the `includes/plugin-pages.php` file in version 1.3.2 and earlier:
```php
if ( false === @move_uploaded_file( $tmp_file, $new_file ) ) { 
  $is_valid=false;
  $msgs['file']=array('class'=>'error','msg'=>__("File not uploaded.", 'contact-form-entries')); 
  break; 
}else{
  $files[]=$folder.'/'.$filename;
}
```
- The fix was implemented in version 1.3.3 by adding a check for allowed file extensions before moving the file, starting around line 1212:
```php
$ext = pathinfo($filename, PATHINFO_EXTENSION);
if(in_array($ext,$not_allowed_files)){
 $is_valid=false;
 $msgs['file']=array('class'=>'error','msg'=>__("File not allowed.", 'contact-form-entries'));
 break;
}
if ( false === @move_uploaded_file( $tmp_file, $new_file ) ) {
```
- The `$not_allowed_files` array contains extensions such as 'js', 'php', 'html', 'css', 'sql', etc.
- The plugin versions affected are up to and including version 1.3.2.
- The patched version is 1.3.3.

**Summary:**

The Contact Form Entries plugin had an arbitrary file upload vulnerability that could be exploited by authenticated users with administrative privileges. The vulnerability was due to a lack of proper validation of uploaded file extensions in the `view_page` function, which allowed an attacker to upload malicious files to the server. This could lead to remote code execution and complete compromise of the affected WordPress website. The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.3.3 of the plugin.
