{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application directly concatenates user-supplied input into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL injection vulnerability. Specifically, a blind SQL injection.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including the database name, table data, and potentially other sensitive information. The attacker can also potentially modify or delete data within the database. In this case, the attacker was able to determine the database name using blind injection.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exposed through the HTTP GET parameter `ASK_DUTY_ID` in the `/general/attendance/manage/ask_duty/delete.php` endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. The attacker may need to be authenticated to access the vulnerable endpoint, as cookies are used in the provided example."
