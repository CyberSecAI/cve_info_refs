The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in Wanhu EZOFFICE software.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of the `recordId` parameter in the `wf_printnum.jsp` file. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The `recordId` parameter in the `wf_printnum.jsp` file is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database server. This could lead to:
    - Data breaches: Accessing sensitive information in the database.
    - Data manipulation: Modifying or deleting data.
    - Service disruption: Causing database server errors and application downtime.
    - Potential for further compromise: Executing operating system commands on the server, if the database user has sufficient privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint (`/defaultroot/platform/bpm/work_flow/operate/wf_printnum.jsp;.js`) with a malicious `recordId` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint of the Wanhu EZOFFICE application. No prior authentication is mentioned for this vulnerability.
