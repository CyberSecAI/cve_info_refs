- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists within the G DATA Backup Service. By creating a symbolic link, an attacker can abuse the service to delete a file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of symbolic links, leading to arbitrary file deletion.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system and create a symbolic link to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
