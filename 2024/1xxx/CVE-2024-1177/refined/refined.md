The provided content relates to **CVE-2024-1177**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `settings_save()` function in the `class-wpcm-admin-permalink-settings.php` file of the WP Club Manager plugin lacked a capability check and nonce validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing authorization check:** The `settings_save()` function did not verify if the user performing the action had the necessary permissions.
- **Missing nonce validation:** The function did not validate a nonce, which is a security token to prevent CSRF attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An unauthenticated attacker could modify the permalink structure for clubs by sending a crafted request to the `settings_save()` function.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is over the network.
- An unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not require any special privileges or authentication.
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (which is publicly accessible) and the names of the parameters to modify.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerability was present in all versions of the plugin up to and including 2.2.10.
- The issue was fixed in version 2.2.11 by adding a capability check (`current_user_can('manage_options')`) and nonce validation (`check_admin_referer('update-permalink')`) to the `settings_save()` function.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Francesco Carlucci via Wordfence.
