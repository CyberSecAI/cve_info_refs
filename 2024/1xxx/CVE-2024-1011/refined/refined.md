{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application lacks proper access control checks, allowing unauthorized users to access and modify sensitive data and functionality.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper Access Control (CWE-284), specifically broken access control, allowing employee users to access admin functionalities.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Unauthorized access to administrative functionalities such as approving or declining leave requests. This can lead to data manipulation, and potentially other unauthorized actions, compromising the confidentiality and integrity of the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "By directly accessing administrative endpoints (e.g., `/employee_akpoly/Admin/delete-leave.php`, `/employee_akpoly/Admin/process_leave.php`) through modified requests.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a logged-in employee user with the ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests, for example using a tool like Burp Suite. No special administrative privileges are initially required."
