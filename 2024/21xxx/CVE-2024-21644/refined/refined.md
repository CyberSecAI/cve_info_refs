The provided content relates to CVE-2024-21644.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from an unauthenticated user's ability to access a specific URL (`/render/info.html`) which exposes the Flask configuration, including the `SECRET_KEY`. This is due to the `info.html` template directly rendering the Flask `config` variable, which is normally overwritten in the `info()` route handler. However, when accessed directly, the `config` variable is not overwritten.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Exposure:** The Flask configuration, containing sensitive information such as the `SECRET_KEY`, is exposed to unauthenticated users.
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The `/render/<path:filename>` route allows direct access to template files, bypassing intended context setting for the template.
- **Lack of Access Control:** No authentication or authorization is enforced on the `/render/<path:filename>` route.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exposure of sensitive configuration data, including the `SECRET_KEY`.
- Potential for further attacks depending on the exposed secrets.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker sends a request to the vulnerable endpoint (`/render/info.html`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application. No prior authentication is required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is described as an unlikely coincidence stemming from the way Flask handles template variables named `config`.
- The fix involves renaming the config variable within the info.html template to `config_folder` and also changing the `info()` route handler to pass the config folder information with that variable.
