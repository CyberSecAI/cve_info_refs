# Log Injection

Moderate

[GammaC0de](/GammaC0de)
published
GHSA-ghmw-rwh8-6qmr
Jan 6, 2024

## Package

pip

pyload-ng
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 0.5.0b3.dev76

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Summary

A log injection vulnerability was identified in `pyload`. This vulnerability allows any unauthenticated actor to inject arbitrary messages into the logs gathered by `pyload`.

### Details

`pyload` will generate a log entry when attempting to sign in with faulty credentials. This entry will be in the form of `Login failed for user 'USERNAME'`. However, when supplied with a username containing a newline, this newline is not properly escaped. Newlines are also the delimiter between log entries. This allows the attacker to inject new log entries into the log file.

### PoC

Run `pyload` in the default configuration by running the following command

```
pyload

```

We can now sign in as the pyload user and view the logs at `http://localhost:8000/logs`.

[![Viewing the logs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44903767/294433796-f2c96e39-8000-4649-99bb-9c50e786243d.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44903767/294433796-f2c96e39-8000-4649-99bb-9c50e786243d.png)

Any unauthenticated attacker can now make the following request to inject arbitrary logs.

```
curl 'http://localhost:8000/login?next=http://localhost:8000/' -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' --data-raw $'do=login&username=wrong\'%0a[2024-01-05 02:49:19]  HACKER               PinkDraconian  THIS ENTRY HAS BEEN INJECTED&password=wrong&submit=Login'

```

If we now were to look at the logs again, we see that the entry has successfully been injected.

[![PoC2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44903767/294434785-2fc6dce4-3e2c-4da0-8e80-a6bba882f756.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44903767/294434785-2fc6dce4-3e2c-4da0-8e80-a6bba882f756.png)

### Impact

Forged or otherwise, corrupted log files can be used to cover an attacker’s tracks or even to implicate another party in the commission of a malicious act.

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-21645
