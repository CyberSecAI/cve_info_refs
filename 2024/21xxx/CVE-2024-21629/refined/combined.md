# Erroneous handling of `record\_external\_operation` error return

Moderate

[sorpaas](/sorpaas)
published
GHSA-27wg-99g8-2v4v
Jan 2, 2024

## Package

cargo

evm
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

<= 0.41.0

## Patched versions

0.41.1

## Description

### Impact

In `rust-evm`, a feature called `record_external_operation` was introduced, allowing library users to record custom gas changes. This feature can have some bogus interactions with the call stack.

In particular, during finalization of a `CREATE` or `CREATE2`, in the case that [the substack execution happens successfully](https://github.com/rust-ethereum/evm/blob/release-v041/src/executor/stack/executor.rs#L1012C25-L1012C69), `rust-evm` will first commit the substate, and then call `record_external_operation(Write(out_code.len()))`. If `record_external_operation` later fails, this error is returned to the parent call stack, instead of `Succeeded`. Yet, the substate commitment already happened. This causes smart contracts able to commit state changes, when the parent caller contract receives zero address (which usually indicates that the execution has failed).

This issue only impacts library users with custom `record_external_operation` that returns errors.

### Patches

The issue is patched in release 0.41.1. The commit can be seem [here](https://github.com/rust-ethereum/evm/commit/d8991ec727ad0fb64fe9957a3cd307387a6701e4).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
