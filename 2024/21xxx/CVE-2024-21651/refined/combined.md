High

published
GHSA-8959-rfxh-r4j4
Jan 8, 2024

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-distribution-war
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>=14.10

## Patched versions

15.5.3, 15.8-rc-1, 14.10.18

## Description

### Impact

A user able to attach a file to a page can post a malformed TAR file by manipulating file modification times headers, which when parsed by Tika, could cause a denial of service issue via CPU consumption.

### Patches

This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 14.10.18, 15.5.3 and 15.8 RC1.

### Workarounds

The workaround is to download [commons-compress 1.24](https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/apache/commons/commons-compress/1.24.0/commons-compress-1.24.0.jar) and replace the one located in XWiki `WEB-INF/lib/` folder.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
