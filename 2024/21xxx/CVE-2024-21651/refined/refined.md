Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-21651

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the processing of malformed TAR files by the Tika library. Specifically, the issue arises when a crafted TAR file with manipulated file modification time headers is parsed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  Improper handling of TAR file headers, specifically file modification times, by the Tika library.
- This allows for a denial-of-service attack due to excessive CPU consumption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  A successful exploit leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The excessive CPU consumption caused by parsing the malformed TAR file renders the affected XWiki instance unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  The attack vector is network-based.
- Attackers exploit the ability to attach files to pages in XWiki.
- An attacker uploads a specifically crafted TAR file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers need the ability to upload files to XWiki pages. No special privileges are required, just user-level access to attach files.
- No user interaction is required for successful exploitation.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in XWiki versions 14.10 and above.
- Patched versions are 14.10.18, 15.5.3, and 15.8-rc-1.
- A workaround involves replacing the vulnerable `commons-compress` library with version 1.24.
- The fix is related to an upgrade of the commons-compress library.
- CVSS v3 score is 7.5, with high availability impact.
- CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) is the associated weakness.
