Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-21650:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from improper handling of user-supplied input within the user registration feature of XWiki. Specifically, the "first name" and "last name" fields during user registration are not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code. The injected code is then executed when the registration success message is displayed, which includes the user's first and last name.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user-provided input in the registration form, allowing for code injection.
*   **Insecure String Interpolation/Rendering:** The success message renders the user's first and last name using a mechanism that interprets the input as code rather than plain text.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the XWiki instance, potentially leading to complete system compromise. This can include data breaches, malware deployment, or denial of service attacks.
*   **Compromise of XWiki Instance:** An attacker can take full control of the vulnerable XWiki instance.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User Registration Form:** The primary attack vector is the user registration form, specifically the "first name" and "last name" fields.
*   **Guest Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable when guest user registration is enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the XWiki instance through the network.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication is required, as the attack is performed during the user registration process.
*   **Ability to Fill Form:** The attacker only needs the ability to fill the registration form fields with a crafted payload.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Payload Example:** The provided example payload is: `]]{{/html}}{{async}}{{groovy}}services.logging.getLogger("attacker").error("Attack succeeded!"){{/groovy}}{{/async}}`. This payload leverages XWiki's templating engine to execute Groovy code, which in this case writes an error message to the logs.
*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects XWiki versions:
    *   >= 2.2, < 14.10.17
    *   >= 15.0-rc-1, < 15.5.3
    *    >= 15.6-rc-1, < 15.8-rc-1
*   **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability has been patched in XWiki versions 14.10.17, 15.5.3 and 15.8 RC1.
*   **Workaround:** A workaround is provided by modifying the "Registration Successful Message" in the XWiki admin settings to use the following code to ensure proper escaping of the user link:
```
#set($message = $services.localization.render('core.register.successful', 'xwiki/2.1', ['USERLINK', $userName]))
#set($userLink = $xwiki.getUserName("$userSpace$userName"))
{{info}}$message.replace('USERLINK', "{{html clean=false}}$userLink{{/html}}"){{/info}}
```

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is tracked in the XWiki Jira issue [XWIKI-21173](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-21173).
*   The fix for this vulnerability is linked to the commit [b290bfd](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/b290bfd573c6f7db6cc15a88dd4111d9fcad0d31).
*   The GitHub Security Advisory for this vulnerability is [GHSA-rj7p-xjv7-7229](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-rj7p-xjv7-7229).
* The vulnerability is classified as CWE-95 (Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')).
