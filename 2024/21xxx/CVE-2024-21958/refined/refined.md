- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The AMD Provisioning Console (APC) Software inherits its permissions from the parent folder during the installation process. The Access Control List (ACL) permissions for the installation folder and its subfolders/files were not appropriately configured.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect default permissions in the AMD Provisioning Console installation directory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Privilege escalation leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A low-privileged user on the system with the vulnerable software installed.
