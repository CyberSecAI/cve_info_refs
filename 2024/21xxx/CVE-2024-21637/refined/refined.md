Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-21637:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the `redirect_uri` parameter in the OAuth2 authorization flow when using `response_mode=form_post`. Specifically, when a wildcard (`*` or `.*`) is used in the allowed redirect URIs configuration of an OAuth2 provider, an attacker can specify a malicious `redirect_uri`, such as a `javascript:` URI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an XSS issue. By setting a malicious `redirect_uri` (e.g., a `javascript:` URI), an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the context of the authentik application.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate the `redirect_uri` parameter, especially when wildcards are used in the allowed redirect URIs, allowing the inclusion of malicious schemes like `javascript:`.
*   **Misconfiguration Risk:** The vulnerability is exacerbated by the fact that authentik allows wildcard characters in the allowed redirect URI configuration, making it easier for attackers to bypass restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Token Capture:** An attacker can craft a malicious `redirect_uri` to capture authentik's session token when the `response_mode=form_post` is used.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker could potentially perform a privilege escalation if they have permissions to manage applications and can use the vulnerability to gain higher-level access.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The injected JavaScript code can be used to perform actions within the context of the authenticated user, potentially leading to data theft or further exploitation.
*   **Account Takeover:** By capturing session tokens, attackers could potentially take over user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The attack is network-based, meaning that an attacker can initiate the attack remotely.
*   **OAuth2 Authorization Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted OAuth2 authorization request, specifically using `response_mode=form_post` and setting the `redirect_uri` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated/Unprivileged Access (Misconfiguration Scenario):** In cases where the allowed redirect URI is configured with wildcards (e.g., `*` or `.*`), an unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Application Management Permissions (Privilege Escalation Scenario):** An attacker with permissions to manage applications can use the vulnerability to perform privilege escalation.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction, as the user must be redirected to the malicious `redirect_uri` after the authorization process.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in authentik versions 2023.10.6 and 2023.8.6.
*   The vulnerability is classified as High severity with a CVSS score of 7.7.
*   The vulnerability is identified as CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting).
