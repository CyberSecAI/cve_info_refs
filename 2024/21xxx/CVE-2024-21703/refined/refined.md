- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A security misconfiguration in Atlassian Confluence Data Center for Windows installations, where the `confluence.cfg.xml` file is readable by the `BUILTIN/Users` group by default.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect permission assignment for a critical resource (CWE-732). The `confluence.cfg.xml` file contains sensitive information that should not be accessible to the `BUILTIN/Users` group.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with local access to the Windows host within the `BUILTIN/Users` group can read the sensitive information in the `confluence.cfg.xml` file. This could lead to local privilege escalation, as the attacker can potentially gain the same privileges as the Confluence installation user.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local access to the Windows host where Confluence Data Center is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have local access to the Windows machine and be a member of the `BUILTIN/Users` group.
