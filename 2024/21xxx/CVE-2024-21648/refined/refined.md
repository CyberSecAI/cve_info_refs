Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the rollback and delete version functionalities in XWiki not properly triggering the `UserUpdatingDocumentEvent`. This event is crucial because the `RightsFilterListener` relies on it to enforce access control.  Specifically, the `XWiki#checkSavingDocument` method, which is responsible for producing this event, was not being called during rollback or when deleting the current version from history.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Access Control Check:** The core issue is the absence of a rights check when performing a rollback or deleting the current version, allowing users to bypass access restrictions.
*   **Incorrect Event Triggering:** The system failed to trigger the `UserUpdatingDocumentEvent` during rollbacks, which is what the `RightsFilterListener` uses to enforce rights.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A user with edit rights on a document could potentially perform a rollback or delete the current version to a state where they have additional rights (e.g., delete rights) they were previously denied, enabling them to perform actions they should not be permitted to do. In the provided example a user with edit rights only was able to rollback the page to a state where they had delete rights.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** The vulnerability allows unauthorized modification or deletion of documents.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Rollback Feature:** An attacker uses the history feature to rollback to a previous version that grants the attacker more rights.
*   **Delete Current Version from History:** An attacker can delete the current document version to force a rollback to a previous version, also leading to an increase in rights.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least edit rights on the target document.
*   **Access to Document History:** The attacker needs access to the history feature of the target document.
*   **Knowledge of Previous Document States:** The attacker needs to be aware of a previous version of the document that grants more rights.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is labeled with `attack_edit` and `attack_escalation` confirming that it allows an attacker to edit and escalate privileges.
*   The fix was to ensure the `checkSavingDocument` method is called when performing rollbacks or deleting the current version.
*   The fix was applied to versions 14.10.17, 15.5.3 and 15.8-rc-1
