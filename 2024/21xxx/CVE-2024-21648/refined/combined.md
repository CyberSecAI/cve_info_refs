#### Description

Reproduction steps:

* On a fresh wiki with standard rights, login with Admin create a page Test and a user Foo
* Administer page Test to forbid Delete right to Foo on the page only: the UI forces you to first grant the right and then deny it
* History of the page should have 3 version for Test: original creation, grant of delete right and deny of delete right
* Login with Foo, you should have edit right on Test with standard right scheme, go to history and tries to rollback to second version (which grant delete right)

Expected result:

* the UI link should be available (because of edit right) but the action should either lead to an error and shouldn't do anything

Obtained result:

* the link is working, the rollback is performed and Foo is now able to delete the page Test

This can also be done by deleting the current version from the history (which cause a rollback of the document to the previous version).

The root cause is that those two rollbacks causes ("rollback" and "current version delete from the history") are missing a call to XWiki#checkSavingDocument which is in charge of producing `UserUpdatingDocumentEvent` event which is what `RightsFilterListener` rely on.

# No right protection on rollback action

High

[surli](/surli)
published
GHSA-xh35-w7wg-95v3
Jan 8, 2024

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-oldcore
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

> 1.0

## Patched versions

14.10.17,15.5.3,15.8-rc-1

## Description

### Impact

The rollback action is missing a right protection: it means that a user can rollback to a previous version of the page to gain rights they don't have anymore.

This vulnerability impacts all version of XWiki since rollback action is available.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in XWiki 14.10.16, 15.5.3 and 15.8-rc-1 by ensuring that the rights are checked before performing the rollback.

### Workarounds

There's no workaround for this vulnerability, except paying attention to delete old versions of documents that could allow users to gain more rights.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
