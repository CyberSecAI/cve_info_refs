## Description

![@Ali-Razmjoo](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7676267?u=345e0b69bae7359ac98e46c642b9a1257b5b6cfc&v=4&size=48)[Ali-Razmjoo](https://github.com/Ali-Razmjoo)opened [on Aug 24, 2024](https://github.com/spotify/luigi/issues/3301#issue-2484512603)

Hi,

I am reporting a potential security issue with arbitrary file write during tarfile extraction in

<https://github.com/spotify/luigi/blob/master/luigi/contrib/sge_runner.py#L67-L70>

Extracting files from a malicious tar archive without validating that the destination file path is within the destination directory can cause files outside the destination directory to be overwritten, due to the possible presence of directory traversal elements (..) in archive paths.

* `..\malicious_file`
* `c:\malicious_file`
* `/etc/passwd`

## Recommendation

```
with tarfile.open(sys.argv[1]) as tar:
    for entry in tar:
        #GOOD: Check that entry is safe
        if os.path.isabs(entry.name) or ".." in entry.name:
            raise ValueError("Illegal tar archive entry")
        tar.extract(entry, "/tmp/unpack/")
```

## How to fix?

Upgrade `luigi` to version 3.6.0 or higher.

## Overview

[luigi](https://pypi.org/project/luigi/) is a package that helps you build complex pipelines of batch jobs. It handles dependency resolution, workflow management, visualization, handling failures, command line integration, and much more.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (Zip Slip) due to improper destination file path validation in the `_extract_packages_archive` function.

## Details

It is exploited using a specially crafted zip archive, that holds path traversal filenames. When exploited, a filename in a malicious archive is concatenated to the target extraction directory, which results in the final path ending up outside of the target folder. For instance, a zip may hold a file with a "../../file.exe" location and thus break out of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.

The following is an example of a zip archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicous file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:

```

+2018-04-15 22:04:29 ..... 19 19 good.txt

+2018-04-15 22:04:42 ..... 20 20 ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys

```
