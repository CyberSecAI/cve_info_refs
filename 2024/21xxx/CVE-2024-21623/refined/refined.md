Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-21623:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an arbitrary expression injection within a GitHub Actions workflow file (`analysis-sonarcloud.yml`). Specifically, the `sonar-scanner` command includes the pull request branch name (`github.event.pull_request.head.ref`) directly in the command line without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code within the branch name which will then be executed by the runner.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Expression Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the direct use of the pull request branch name within a command string. GitHub Actions expressions, when not properly handled, can be exploited to execute arbitrary commands.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The workflow fails to sanitize or validate the pull request branch name, allowing an attacker to insert special characters and shell commands into the branch name, leading to command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the GitHub Actions runner, which is the machine that executes the workflow. This allows the attacker to perform a wide array of malicious actions.
- **Secret and Token Leakage:** The attacker can access sensitive environment variables, including secrets and tokens (such as `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `SONAR_TOKEN`).
- **Repository Alteration:** The attacker can modify the repository content, potentially injecting malicious code or altering files.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Branch Name:** The attacker crafts a malicious pull request branch name containing shell command injection payload.
- **Pull Request Creation:** The attacker creates a pull request using the malicious branch name. This triggers the vulnerable GitHub Actions workflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **GitHub Account:** The attacker needs a GitHub account.
- **Forking Access:** The attacker needs the ability to fork the vulnerable repository.
- **Pull Request Creation:** The attacker needs the ability to create pull requests to the targeted repository.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability exists in this part of the `analysis-sonarcloud.yml` workflow:
```yaml
- name: Run PR sonar-scanner
  if: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' || github.event_name == 'pull_request_target' }}
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
  run: |
    sonar-scanner \
      --define sonar.cfamily.threads="${{ env.NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS  }}" \
      --define sonar.cfamily.cache.enabled=true \
      --define sonar.cfamily.cache.path="$HOME/.cfamily" \
      --define sonar.cfamily.compile-commands=build/compile_commands.json \
      --define sonar.pullrequest.key=${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} \
      --define sonar.pullrequest.branch=${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }} \
      --define sonar.pullrequest.base=${{ github.event.pull_request.base_ref }}
```
The attacker injects the malicious payload in the branch name that will be used in the following command:
`sonar-scanner .... --define sonar.pullrequest.branch=${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}`

A successful attack was demonstrated by creating a branch with the name `sss$(whoami)]@sim4n6`. This resulted in the execution of the `whoami` command on the runner.
