### @camertron **[camertron](/camertron)** commented [Jan 3, 2024](#issue-2064501643) ‚Ä¢ edited Loading

### What are you trying to accomplish?

This PR addresses a security concern affecting components that define a `#call` method. In most cases, HTML escaping is handled either by the template handler (ERB, Slim, HAML, etc) or by ActionView when the rendered string is appended to the output buffer. However, if a controller renders a component directly, the rendered string is not escaped and can be a vector for [cross-site scripting](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) (XSS) and similar attacks.

Consider the following component:

```
class UnsafeComponent < ApplicationComponent
  def initialize(user_defined_input)
    @user_defined_input = user_defined_input
  end

  def call
    "<div>#{@user_defined_input}</div>"
  end
end
```

If the component is rendered directly by the controller...

```
class MyController < ApplicationController
  def create
    render UnsafeComponent.new(params[:user_defined_input])
  end
end
```

...and `params[:user_defined_input]` is the string `<script>alert("foo")</script>`, the alert will be injected onto the page without being escaped, resulting in a browser alert. Since `params[:user_defined_input]` can contain arbitrary JavaScript code, cookies and other sensitive information can be exfiltrated to a 3rd-party.

### What approach did you choose and why?

This PR ensures that rendered output is HTML escaped, and if it is not, prints a warning and escapes it automatically. It does this for output from `#call` methods, output generated by template handlers, and for postambles.

Finally, it examines the MIME type of the request and only performs automatic escaping when generating HTML. In other words, JSON generated by eg. jbuilder will not be automatically escaped.

### Performance Impact

```
Warming up --------------------------------------
              render   366.000 i/100ms
Calculating -------------------------------------
              render      3.703k (¬± 6.1%) i/s -     36.966k in  10.021240s

Warming up --------------------------------------
         safe render   302.000 i/100ms
Calculating -------------------------------------
         safe render      3.522k (¬±11.5%) i/s -     34.730k in  10.005739s

Comparison:
              render:     3703.0 i/s
         safe render:     3522.1 i/s - same-ish: difference falls within error

```

Performance is impacted, but not to a significant degree üëç

| [@Spone](https://github.com/Spone) we discussed that a bit internally and decided not to, but I could be persuaded otherwise.  Well, I have half a dozen Rails apps that cannot be deployed today because bundler-audit is a mandatory step in my deployment pipeline:  ``` $ bundle exec bundle-audit check --update Download ruby-advisory-db ... Cloning into '/root/.local/share/ruby-advisory-db'... ruby-advisory-db:   advisories:	842 advisories   last updated:	2024-01-07 12:48:57 -0800   commit:	2bf8ea3b6c77df021a20db7cb63517dd4ca87bde Name: view_component Version: 2.82.0 CVE: CVE-2024-21636 GHSA: GHSA-wf2x-8w6j-qw37 Criticality: Medium URL: https://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component/security/advisories/GHSA-wf2x-8w6j-qw37 Title: view_component Cross-site Scripting vulnerability Solution: upgrade to >= 3.9.0 Vulnerabilities found!  ```  I can either disable the bundler-audit check and open myself to vulnerabilities in other gems, or upgrade to ViewComponent 3.x, but given the slots breaking change, that would take hours if not days.  EDIT: I just figured out about the ignore configuration file for bundler-audit, but I think it's still not ideal that these Rails apps will stay exposed until they are upgraded to VC 3.  I'm pretty confident I'm not the only one in this case. |

# Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') in view\_component

Low

[camertron](/camertron)
published
GHSA-wf2x-8w6j-qw37
Jan 4, 2024

## Package

bundler

view\_component
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

>= 3.0.0, < 3.9.0
< 2.83.0

## Patched versions

>= 3.9.0
>= 2.83.0, < 3.0.0

## Description

### Impact

*What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?*

This is an XSS vulnerability that has the potential to impact anyone rendering a component directly from a controller with the view\_component gem. Note that only components that define a [`#call` method](https://viewcomponent.org/guide/templates.html#call) (i.e. instead of using a sidecar template) are affected. The return value of the `#call` method is not sanitized and can include user-defined content.

In addition, the return value of the [`#output_postamble` method](https://viewcomponent.org/api.html#output_postamble--string) is not sanitized, which can also lead to XSS issues.

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

Versions 3.9.0 has been released and fully mitigates both the `#call` and the `#output_postamble` vulnerabilities.

### Workarounds

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?*

Sanitize the return value of `#call`, eg:

```
class MyComponent < ApplicationComponent
  def call
    html_escape("<div>#{user_input}</div>")
  end
end
```
### References

*Are there any links users can visit to find out more?*

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
