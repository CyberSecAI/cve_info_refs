Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-21643:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `Microsoft.IdentityModel.Protocols.SignedHttpRequest` library trusting the `jku` claim by default. This claim is used to retrieve the public key for validating the signature of a signed HTTP request.  By trusting this claim, the library allows the retrieval of a key from an arbitrary URL provided in the `jku` claim, which can lead to fetching a malicious key and thus compromising the validation process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted retrieval of keys from URLs specified in the `jku` claim.
- Default trust of the `jku` claim without any validation or restrictions on the source URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE) through the ability to make arbitrary `HTTP GET` requests and influence `PoP` key validation. An attacker can provide a malicious key, leading to successful validation of malicious signed http requests.
- The vulnerability can be exploited to bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms, leading to unauthorized access to resources.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attacker crafts a signed HTTP request with a malicious `jku` claim. This claim points to a URL controlled by the attacker, which serves a malicious public key.
- When the server processes this request, it fetches the malicious key from the attacker's URL, and uses it to validate the request.
- By controlling the key used for validation, the attacker can get malicious signed requests to be considered valid and hence execute malicious actions in the service.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft signed HTTP requests and influence the content of the `jku` claim.
- The attacker needs a publicly accessible HTTP server to host the malicious key.
- The service must be using the `SignedHttpRequest` protocol or the `SignedHttpRequestValidator` classes of the library.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to version 7.1.2 or higher for 7.x versions or 6.34.0 or higher for 6.x versions of the `Microsoft.IdentityModel.Protocols.SignedHttpRequest` package.
- After upgrading, configure the `SignedHttpRequestValidationParameters` to explicitly:
    - set `AllowResolvingPopKeyFromJku` to false (to disable resolution of keys from `jku` claim completely) or,
    - if required, set `AllowResolvingPopKeyFromJku` to true, and populate `AllowedDomainsForJkuRetrieval` with a list of trusted domains only, limiting the domains from which keys can be retrieved.

This vulnerability is associated with GHSA-rv9j-c866-gp5h.
