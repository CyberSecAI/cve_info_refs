# Improper Access Control allows unprivileged user to access customers duplicates list

Moderate

[wisconaut](/wisconaut)
published
GHSA-c38c-c8mh-vq68
Jan 10, 2024

## Package

composer

pimcore/customer-data-framework
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

<= 4.0.5

## Patched versions

4.0.6

## Description

### Summary

An authenticated and unauthorized user can access the list of potential duplicate users and see their data.

### Details

Permissions do not seem to be enforced when reaching the `/admin/customermanagementframework/duplicates/list` endpoint allowing an authenticated user without the permissions to access the endpoint and query the data available there. It seems that the access control is not enforced in this place :

[customer-data-framework/src/Controller/Admin/DuplicatesController.php](https://github.com/pimcore/customer-data-framework/blob/b4af625ef327c58d05ef7cdf145fa749d2d4195e/src/Controller/Admin/DuplicatesController.php#L43)

Line 43
in
[b4af625](/pimcore/customer-data-framework/commit/b4af625ef327c58d05ef7cdf145fa749d2d4195e)

|  | public function listAction(Request $request, DuplicatesIndexInterface $duplicatesIndex): Response |
| --- | --- |

### PoC

In order to reproduce the issue, the following steps can be followed :

1. As an administrator :

   a. Create a role without any permission through Settings → User & Roles → Roles in the administration panel

   b. Create an user through Settings → User & Roles → Users and assign it the unprivileged role previously created
2. Log out the current administrator and log in with this new user
3. Access to the following endpoint `https://pimcore_instance/admin/customermanagementframework/duplicates/list` and the results will be returned to this unauthorized user

### Impact

An unauthorized user can access PII data from customers without being authorized to.

### Severity

Moderate

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

### CVE ID
