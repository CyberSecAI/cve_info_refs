The provided content contains information about a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in FlyCms v1.0.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding within the permission management section of the application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the presence of an XSS vulnerability, allowing injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript into the application's context.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability could lead to:
    - Execution of malicious scripts in the victim's browser.
    - Session hijacking and unauthorized access.
    - Data theft or manipulation.
    - Defacement of the web page.
    - Redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through injecting malicious code via input fields related to permission management.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need the ability to inject the payload into the vulnerable input fields within the permission management section. This likely requires an account with some level of access to that section of the application.

The provided information includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating the XSS:
```
"><img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>
```
This code, when injected, triggers an alert box, verifying the successful injection and execution of JavaScript.
