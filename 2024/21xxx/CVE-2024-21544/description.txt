Versions of the package spatie/browsershot before 5.0.1 are vulnerable to Improper Input Validation due to improper URL validation through the setUrl method.An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by using leading whitespace (%20) before the file:// protocol, resulting in Local File Inclusion, which allows the attacker to read sensitive files on the server.
