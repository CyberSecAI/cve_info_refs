[CVE-2024-21544  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21544) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-20  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `spatie/browsershot` to version 5.0.1 or higher.

## Overview

[spatie/browsershot](http://github.com/spatie/browsershot) is a library for converting a webpage to an image or pdf using headless Chrome.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Input Validation due to improper URL validation through the `setUrl` method.
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by using leading whitespace (`%20`) before the `file://` protocol, resulting in Local File Inclusion, which allows the attacker to read sensitive files on the server.

## PoC

```
http://localhost:5865/test.php?input=%20file:///etc/passwd

```
