Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with Rapid SCADA, specifically focusing on CVE-2024-21852:

**CVE-2024-21852: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a Zip Slip vulnerability in the unpacking routine. This means the software does not properly sanitize filenames within a ZIP archive, allowing for path traversal during extraction.
*   **Weakness:** Improper input validation and sanitization of filenames during the extraction of compressed files. Specifically, the application fails to properly limit a pathname to a restricted directory, allowing traversal outside the intended destination folder.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can supply a malicious configuration file (likely within a ZIP archive) that, upon extraction, can overwrite files in other directories, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack involves supplying a specially crafted ZIP archive containing malicious file entries with directory traversal sequences in their names (e.g., "../../../evil.exe"). When the application extracts this archive, the files are written outside of the intended destination, potentially overwriting critical system files.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to supply malicious configuration files, which could potentially be achieved with low privileges, as indicated by CVSS vector string (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). The attacker would need to have network access to the application and the ability to upload the malicious archive.

**Additional Vulnerabilities Mentioned in the Advisory:**

*   **CVE-2024-22096: Relative Path Traversal:** An attacker can read arbitrary files by appending path traversal characters to the filename during a specific command, similar to CVE-2024-21852 but through a different mechanism.
*   **CVE-2024-22016: Local Privilege Escalation:**  Improper permissions allow any authenticated user to write directly to the SCADA directory, potentially enabling privilege escalation.
*  **CVE-2024-21794: Open Redirect:** The login page allows open redirects which could be exploited for phishing.
*   **CVE-2024-21764: Use of Hard-coded Credentials:** The product contains hardcoded credentials, allowing an attacker to connect to a specific port.
*   **CVE-2024-21869: Plaintext Storage of a Password:** Credentials are stored in plaintext, accessible to a local attacker.
*   **CVE-2024-21866: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information:** Specific malformed requests elicit error messages revealing sensitive data.

**Mitigation Recommendations:**

The advisory recommends standard security measures, such as:

*   Limiting network exposure for control systems.
*   Isolating control system networks behind firewalls.
*   Using VPNs for remote access and keeping them updated.
*   Avoiding clicking on links or opening attachments in unsolicited emails.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vendor, Rapid Software LLC, did not respond to CISA's attempts at coordination.
*   The affected product is Rapid SCADA version 5.8.4 and prior.
*   The vulnerabilities have been reported by Noam Moshe of Claroty Research.
