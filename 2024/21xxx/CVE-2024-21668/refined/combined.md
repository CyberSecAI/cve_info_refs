# Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File in react-native-mmkv

Moderate

published
GHSA-4jh3-6jhv-2mgp
Jan 9, 2024

## Package

npm

react-native-mmkv
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<v2.11.0

## Patched versions

v2.11.0

## Description

## Summary

Before version [v2.11.0](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv/releases/tag/v2.11.0), the react-native-mmkv logged the optional encryption key for the MMKV database into the Android system log. The key can be obtained by anyone with access to the Android Debugging Bridge (ADB) if it is enabled in the phone settings. This bug is not present on iOS devices.

## Details

The bridge for communicating between JS code and native code on Android logs the encryption key. This was fixed in commit [a8995cc](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv/commit/a8995ccb7184281f7d168bad3e9987c9bd05f00d) by only logging whether encryption is used.

## Impact

The encryption of an MMKV database protects data from higher privilege processes on the phone that can access the app storage. Additionally, if data in the app's storage is encrypted, it is also encrypted in potential backups.

By logging the encryption secret to the system logs, attackers can trivially recover the secret by enabling ADB and undermining an app's thread model.

The bug was discovered and fixed by somebody else. Not me. I'm just reporting this so users of react-native-mmkv upgrade the dependency.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

[@mrousavy](https://github.com/mrousavy) how do you feel about creating a public advisory about this issue? That way people might update earlier and are aware of this. I can create one if you enable this: <https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/configuring-private-vulnerability-reporting-for-a-repository>

Sorry, something went wrong.
