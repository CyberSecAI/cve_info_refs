…res ([#1190](https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks/pull/1190))

There was a bug in the code which meant that the signatures are only
compared up to the length of the shorter signature, which means that an
attacker can just pass `v1,` as the signature and that will always pass
verification.

This change fixes it so that the length of the signature is also taken
into account when comparing, to make sure that it's always the same
length before comparing.

Manually verified all of the other libraries are correct, and added
tests to JavaScript and Go (even though they were also not affected).

Many thanks to Fredrik Meringdal ([@fmeringdal](https://github.com/fmeringdal)) for the report.

### Threat Intelligence

EPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.
Check out the EPSS

#### Introduced: 6 Feb 2024

[CVE-2024-21491  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21491) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-288  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/288.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses
## How to fix?

Upgrade `svix` to version 1.17.0 or higher.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authentication Bypass due to an issue in the `verify` function where signatures of different lengths are incorrectly compared. An attacker can bypass signature verification by providing a shorter signature that matches the beginning of the actual signature.

**Note:**

The attacker would need to know a victim uses the Rust library for verification,no easy way to automatically check that; and uses `webhooks` by a service that uses `Svix`, and then figure out a way to craft a malicious payload that will actually include all of the correct identifiers needed to trick the receivers to cause actual issues.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

5.9 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control. That is, a successful attack cannot be accomplished at will, but requires the attacker to invest in some measurable amount of effort in preparation or execution against the vulnerable component before a successful attack can be expected.

  **High**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited. For example, a successful exploit may only be possible during the installation of an application by a system administrator.

  **Required**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**

`svix::webhooks::Webhook::verify`

* `<1.17.0`

### Description

The `Webhook::verify` function incorrectly compared signatures of
different lengths - the two signatures would only be compared up to
the length of the shorter signature. This allowed an attacker to
pass in `v1,` as the signature, which would always pass verification.

### @tasn **[tasn](/tasn)** commented [Feb 6, 2024](#issue-2121054703)

There was a bug in the code which meant that the signatures are only compared up to the length of the shorter signature, which means that an attacker can just pass `v1,` as the signature and that will always pass verification.

This change fixes it so that the length of the signature is also taken into account when comparing, to make sure that it's always the same length before comparing.

Manually verified all of the other libraries are correct, and added tests to JavaScript and Go (even though they were also not affected).

Many thanks to Fredrik Meringdal ([@fmeringdal](https://github.com/fmeringdal)) for the report.

Sorry, something went wrong.
