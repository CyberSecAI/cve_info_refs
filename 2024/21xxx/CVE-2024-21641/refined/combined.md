# Logout Route allows open redirects

published

Jan 5, 2024

## Package

flarum/core
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

< 1.8.5

## Patched versions

composer

flarum/framework
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

< 1.8.5

1.8.5

## Description

### Impact

The Flarum `/logout` route includes a redirect parameter that allows any third party to redirect users from a (trusted) domain of the Flarum installation to redirect to any link. Sample: `example.com/logout?return=https://google.com`. For logged-in users, the logout must be confirmed. Guests are immediately redirected. This could be used by spammers to redirect to a web address using a trusted domain of a running Flarum installation.

Some ecosystem extensions modifying the logout route have already been affected. Sample: <https://discuss.flarum.org/d/22229-premium-wordpress-integration/526>

### Patches

The vulnerability has been fixed and published as flarum/core v1.8.5. All communities running Flarum should upgrade as soon as possible to v1.8.5 using:

`composer update --prefer-dist --no-dev -a -W`

You can then confirm you run the latest version using:

`composer show flarum/core`

### Workarounds

Some extensions modifying the logout route can remedy this issue if their implementation is safe. In any case we recommend updating to 1.8.5.

### References

For any questions or comments on this vulnerability, please visit <https://discuss.flarum.org/>

For support questions, create a discussion at <https://discuss.flarum.org/t/support>.

A reminder that if you ever become aware of a security issue in Flarum, please report it to us privately by emailing security@flarum.org, and we will address it promptly.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
