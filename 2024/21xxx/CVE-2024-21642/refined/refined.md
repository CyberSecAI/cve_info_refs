{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The D-Tale application had a feature that allowed users to load data from arbitrary URLs, which could be exploited to perform SSRF attacks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers could potentially access files on the server where D-Tale is hosted.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could provide a malicious URL through the \"Load From the Web\" input in the D-Tale UI, forcing the server to make a request to that URL.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have network access to the D-Tale instance and must be able to interact with its UI."
  },
  "resolution": "The vulnerability was fixed by disabling the \"Load From the Web\" input by default in version 3.9.0. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later. There are workarounds to enable web uploads, but users are warned to only do so in trusted environments. The specific configurations for enabling/disabling this feature are detailed in the advisory description."
