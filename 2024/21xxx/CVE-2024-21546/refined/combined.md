## How to fix?

Upgrade `unisharp/laravel-filemanager` to version 2.9.1 or higher.

## Overview

[unisharp/laravel-filemanager](https://packagist.org/packages/unisharp/laravel-filemanager) is an A file upload/editor intended for use with Laravel 5 to 6 and CKEditor / TinyMCE.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) through using a valid mimetype and inserting the `.` character after the `php` file extension. This allows the attacker to execute malicious code.

|  | In the "Unisharp laravel filemanager" extension, there is an upload shell vulnerability, which leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE). Although the application has mechanisms to prevent users from uploading files with extension `PHP`, `HTML` and mimetype files `text/x-php`, `text/html`, `text/plain`, however, attackers Attackers can bypass this through using a valid mimetype and inserting the `.` character after the `php` file extension (e.g. `filename.php.`). |
