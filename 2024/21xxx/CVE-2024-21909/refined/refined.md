{
  "CVE-2024-21909": {
    "description": "The CBOR library is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to the use of an inefficient algorithm. A maliciously crafted input passed to `DecodeFromBytes` or other CBOR decoding mechanisms can trigger this vulnerability.",
    "root_cause": "Inefficient algorithm used in the CBOR decoding process.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-407: Algorithmic Complexity Vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service. A maliciously crafted CBOR input can cause the decoding process to take an excessive amount of time, potentially leading to resource exhaustion and service disruption.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious CBOR input provided to the `DecodeFromBytes` function or other decoding mechanisms."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted CBOR input to a vulnerable application using the CBOR library.",
    "additional_information": {
      "affected_versions": "Versions 4.0.0 through 4.5.0 are affected.",
      "patched_versions": "Version 4.5.1 contains the fix.",
       "workarounds": "If unable to update, applications can check if input begins with a byte other than 0x80 through 0xDF or does not contain a byte in the range 0xa0 through 0xBF. If either of these conditions are true, then the input is not vulnerable."
