Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-21630:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient permission checks when creating multi-use invite links in Zulip. Specifically, a user who has permission to create multi-use invites, but lacks the permission to add existing users to streams, can still add new users to streams by including the stream IDs when generating an invitation link.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authorization Bypass:** The application fails to properly verify if the user creating a multi-use invite also has the permission to add users to the specified streams.
- **Inconsistent Permissions Model**: There's a discrepancy in how permissions are handled between inviting new users and adding existing users to streams.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A non-admin user can add new users to streams they would not otherwise be able to add existing users to if the organization is configured in a certain way. This bypasses the intended stream membership management controls, and allows a user to add someone to a stream in which they normally would not have privileges. 
- The impact is considered moderate since the vulnerability doesn't allow adding to arbitrary streams, only to streams that the inviting user can already see. 
- No integrity or availability impact, only information disclosure (of stream names).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack. The attacker exploits the vulnerability by creating multi-use invite links through the Zulip application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user in a Zulip organization with the permission to create multi-use invites. They do not need admin rights. 
- They must be able to see the streams that they wish to subscribe the new user to.
- The Zulip organization needs to be configured with non-admins having the ability to create multi-use invites, and also configured to restrict adding users to streams to admins only.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2023-32677, but affects multi-use invites, while CVE-2023-32677 affected single-use invites.
- The vulnerability was patched in Zulip Server version 8.1.
- The provided commit diff shows that the fix involves adding a permission check within the `generate_multiuse_invite_backend` function to ensure that the user creating the invite also has the `can_subscribe_other_users()` permission.
