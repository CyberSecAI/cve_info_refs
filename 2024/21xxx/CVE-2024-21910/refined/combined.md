| v3.3.0 on PyPI installs TinyMCE 5.5.0, which includes the vulnerability.  `master` branch here appears more up-to-date, with TinyMCE 5.10.1 as of a couple weeks back.  Any timeline for a new version release on PyPI to bring in this update? |

# Cross-site scripting vulnerability in TinyMCE plugins

Moderate

[lnewson](/lnewson)
published
GHSA-r8hm-w5f7-wj39
Nov 1, 2021

## Package

tinymce
(npm composer nuget)

## Affected versions

< 5.10.0

## Patched versions

5.10.0

## Description

### Impact

A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the URL processing logic of the `image` and `link` plugins. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when updating an image or link using a specially crafted URL. This issue only impacted users while editing and the dangerous URLs were stripped in any content extracted from the editor. This impacts all users who are using TinyMCE 5.9.2 or lower.

### Patches

This vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 5.10.0 by improved sanitization logic when updating URLs in the relevant plugins.

### Workarounds

To work around this vulnerability, either:

* Upgrade to TinyMCE 5.10.0 or higher
* Disable the `image` and `link` plugins

### Acknowledgements

Tiny Technologies would like to thank Yakir6 for discovering this vulnerability.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
