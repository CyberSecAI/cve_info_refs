[Learn about vigilant mode](https://docs.github.com/github/authenticating-to-github/displaying-verification-statuses-for-all-of-your-commits).

This is the twelfth patch release in the 1.1.z release branch of runc.

It fixes a high-severity container breakout vulnerability involving

leaked file descriptors, and users are strongly encouraged to update as

soon as possible.

* Fix [CVE-2024-21626](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-xr7r-f8xq-vfvv), a container breakout attack that took advantage of

  a file descriptor that was leaked internally within runc (but never

  leaked to the container process).

  In addition to fixing the leak, several strict hardening measures were

  added to ensure that future internal leaks could not be used to break

  out in this manner again.

  Based on our research, while no other container runtime had a similar

  leak, none had any of the hardening steps we've introduced (and some

  runtimes would not check for any file descriptors that a calling

  process may have leaked to them, allowing for container breakouts due

  to basic user error).

### Static Linking Notices

The `runc` binary distributed with this release are *statically linked* with

the following [GNU LGPL-2.1](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.en.html) licensed libraries, with `runc` acting

as a "work that uses the Library":

* [libseccomp](https://github.com/seccomp/libseccomp)

The versions of these libraries were not modified from their upstream versions,

but in order to comply with the LGPL-2.1 (¬ß6(a)), we have attached the

complete source code for those libraries which (when combined with the attached

runc source code) may be used to exercise your rights under the LGPL-2.1.

However we strongly suggest that you make use of your distribution's packages

or download them from the authoritative upstream sources, especially since

these libraries are related to the security of your containers.

## Affected versions

>=v1.0.0-rc93,<=1.1.11

## Patched versions

1.1.12

## Description

### Impact

In runc 1.1.11 and earlier, due to an internal file descriptor leak, an attacker could cause a newly-spawned container process (from `runc exec`) to have a working directory in the host filesystem namespace, allowing for a container escape by giving access to the host filesystem ("attack 2"). The same attack could be used by a malicious image to allow a container process to gain access to the host filesystem through `runc run` ("attack 1"). Variants of attacks 1 and 2 could be also be used to overwrite semi-arbitrary host binaries, allowing for complete container escapes ("attack 3a" and "attack 3b").

Strictly speaking, while attack 3a is the most severe from a CVSS perspective, attacks 2 and 3b are arguably more dangerous in practice because they allow for a breakout from inside a container as opposed to requiring a user execute a malicious image. The reason attacks 1 and 3a are scored higher is because being able to socially engineer users is treated as a given for UI:R vectors, despite attacks 2 and 3b requiring far more minimal user interaction (just reasonable `runc exec` operations on a container the attacker has access to). In any case, all four attacks can lead to full control of the host system.

#### Attack 1: `process.cwd` "mis-configuration"

In runc 1.1.11 and earlier, several file descriptors were inadvertently leaked internally within runc into `runc init`, including a handle to the host's `/sys/fs/cgroup` (this leak was added in v1.0.0-rc93). If the container was configured to have `process.cwd` set to `/proc/self/fd/7/` (the actual fd can change depending on file opening order in `runc`), the resulting pid1 process will have a working directory in the host mount namespace and thus the spawned process can access the entire host filesystem. This alone is not an exploit against runc, however a malicious image could make any innocuous-looking non-`/` path a symlink to `/proc/self/fd/7/` and thus trick a user into starting a container whose binary has access to the host filesystem.

Furthermore, prior to runc 1.1.12, runc also did not verify that the final working directory was inside the container's mount namespace after calling `chdir(2)` (as we have already joined the container namespace, it was incorrectly assumed there would be no way to chdir outside the container after `pivot_root(2)`).

The CVSS score for this attack is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N (8.2, high severity).

Note that this attack requires a privileged user to be tricked into running a malicious container image. It should be noted that when using higher-level runtimes (such as Docker or Kubernetes), this exploit can be considered critical as it can be done remotely by anyone with the rights to start a container image (and can be exploited from within Dockerfiles using `ONBUILD` in the case of Docker).

#### Attack 2: `runc exec` container breakout

(This is a modification of attack 1, constructed to allow for a process inside a container to break out.)

The same fd leak and lack of verification of the working directory in attack 1 also apply to `runc exec`. If a malicious process inside the container knows that some administrative process will call `runc exec` with the `--cwd` argument and a given path, in most cases they can replace that path with a symlink to `/proc/self/fd/7/`. Once the container process has executed the container binary, `PR_SET_DUMPABLE` protections no longer apply and the attacker can open `/proc/$exec_pid/cwd` to get access to the host filesystem.

`runc exec` defaults to a cwd of `/` (which cannot be replaced with a symlink), so this attack depends on the attacker getting a user (or some administrative process) to use `--cwd` and figuring out what path the target working directory is. Note that if the target working directory is a parent of the program binary being executed, the attacker might be unable to replace the path with a symlink (the `execve` will fail in most cases, unless the host filesystem layout specifically matches the container layout in specific ways and the attacker knows which binary the `runc exec` is executing).

The CVSS score for this attack is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N (7.2, high severity).

#### Attacks 3a and 3b: `process.args` host binary overwrite attack

(These are modifications of attacks 1 and 2, constructed to overwrite a host binary by using `execve` to bring a magic-link reference into the container.)

Attacks 1 and 2 can be adapted to overwrite a host binary by using a path like `/proc/self/fd/7/../../../bin/bash` as the `process.args` binary argument, causing a host binary to be executed by a container process. The `/proc/$pid/exe` handle can then be used to overwrite the host binary, as seen in [CVE-2019-5736](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gxmr-w5mj-v8hh "CVE-2019-5736") (note that the same `#!` trick can be used to avoid detection as an attacker). As the overwritten binary could be something like `/bin/bash`, as soon as a privileged user executes the target binary on the host, the attacker can pivot to gain full access to the host.

For the purposes of CVSS scoring:

* Attack 3a is attack 1 but adapted to overwrite a host binary, where a malicious image is set up to execute `/proc/self/fd/7/../../../bin/bash` and run a shell script that overwrites `/proc/self/exe`, overwriting the host copy of `/bin/bash`. The CVSS score for this attack is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H (8.6, high severity).
* Attack 3b is attack 2 but adapted to overwrite a host binary, where the malicious container process overwrites all of the possible `runc exec` target binaries inside the container (such as `/bin/bash`) such that a host target binary is executed and then the container process opens `/proc/$pid/exe` to get access to the host binary and overwrite it. The CVSS score for this attack is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H (8.2, high severity).

As mentioned in attack 1, while 3b is scored lower it is more dangerous in practice as it doesn't require a user to run a malicious image.

### Patches

runc 1.1.12 has been released, and includes patches for this issue. Note that there are four separate fixes applied:

* Checking that the working directory is actually inside the container by checking whether `os.Getwd` returns `ENOENT` (Linux provides a way of detecting if cwd is outside the current namespace root). This explicitly blocks runc from executing a container process when inside a non-container path and thus eliminates attacks 1 and 2 even in the case of fd leaks.
* Close all internal runc file descriptors in the final stage of `runc init`, right before `execve`. This ensures that internal file descriptors cannot be used as an argument to `execve` and thus eliminates attacks 3a and 3b, even in the case of fd leaks. This requires hooking into some Go runtime internals to make sure we don't close critical Go internal file descriptors.
* Fixing the specific fd leaks that made these bug exploitable (mark `/sys/fs/cgroup` as `O_CLOEXEC` and backport a fix for some `*os.File` leaks).
* In order to protect against future `runc init` file descriptor leaks, mark all non-stdio files as `O_CLOEXEC` before executing `runc init`.

### Other Runtimes

We have discovered that several other container runtimes are either potentially vulnerable to similar attacks, or do not have sufficient protection against attacks of this nature. We recommend other container runtime authors look at [our patches](#Patches) and make sure they at least add a `getcwd() != ENOENT` check as well as consider whether `close_range(3, UINT_MAX, CLOSE_RANGE_CLOEXEC)` before executing their equivalent of `runc init` is appropriate.

* crun 1.12 does not leak any useful file descriptors into the `runc init`-equivalent process (so this attack is *not exploitable* as far as we can tell), but no care is taken to make sure all non-stdio files are `O_CLOEXEC` and there is no check after `chdir(2)` to ensure the working directory is inside the container. If a file descriptor happened to be leaked in the future, this could be exploitable. In addition, any file descriptors passed to `crun` are not closed until the container process is executed, meaning that easily-overlooked programming errors by users of `crun` can lead to these attacks becoming exploitable.
* youki 0.3.1 does not leak any useful file descriptors into the `runc init`-equivalent process (so this attack is *not exploitable* as far as we can tell) however this appears to be pure luck. `youki` does leak a directory file descriptor from the host mount namespace, but it just so happens that the directory is the rootfs of the container (which then gets `pivot_root`'d into and so ends up as a in-root path thanks to `chroot_fs_refs`). In addition, no care is taken to make sure all non-stdio files are `O_CLOEXEC` and there is no check after `chdir(2)` to ensure the working directory is inside the container. If a file descriptor happened to be leaked in the future, this could be exploitable. In addition, any file descriptors passed to `youki` are not closed until the container process is executed, meaning that easily-overlooked programming errors by users of `youki` can lead to these attacks becoming exploitable.
* LXC 5.0.3 does not appear to leak any useful file descriptors, and they have comments noting the importance of not leaking file descriptors in `lxc-attach`. However, they don't seem to have any proactive protection against file descriptor leaks at the point of `chdir` such as using `close_range(...)` (they do have RAII-like `__do_fclose` closers but those don't necessarily stop all leaks in this context) nor do they have any check after `chdir(2)` to ensure the working directory is inside the container. Unfortunately it seems they cannot use `CLOSE_RANGE_CLOEXEC` because they don't need to re-exec themselves.

### Workarounds

For attacks 1 and 2, only permit containers (and `runc exec`) to use a `process.cwd` of `/`. It is not possible for `/` to be replaced with a symlink (the path is resolved from within the container's mount namespace, and you cannot change the root of a mount namespace or an fs root to a symlink).

For attacks 1 and 3a, only permit users to run trusted images.

For attack 3b, there is no practical workaround other than never using `runc exec` because any binary you try to execute with `runc exec` could end up being a malicious binary target.

Hello Aleksa,

Thank you and others you credit for doing much more than fixing the
immediate issue, and for disclosing this in so much detail.

What's setcwd(2)?  Perhaps you meant something else?

For reference, here are the threads you started on CVE-2019-5736 and its
exploit back in 2019:

In one of the messages:

<https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/02/13/1>

you mentioned having sent your "AT_THIS_ROOT patchset to LKML -- which

I meant chdir(2), sorry. I had getcwd(3) on my mind.

That eventually became openat2(2) which was merged in Linux 5.6.
Somewhat ironically, the switch to openat2(2) in runc was the cause of
one of the fd leaks that made this issue exploitable in runc! üòÖ

However, I later discovered that execve-related attacks currently cannot
be defended against -- even with a safe file descriptor inside the
container from openat2(2) passed to exeveat(AT_EMPTY_PATH) you can still
escape because the binfmt loader can open files in a way you cannot
control (the ELF loader will load shared libs and binfmt_script will
happily open everything). It might be necessary to add resolution flagst
o execveat(2) as well as a result, but I haven't gotten around to
working on that yet.

There's also some more work to do with blocking certain tricks related
to magic-links used by exploits when breaking out of containers (such as
keeping a handle to /proc/self/exe and then re-opening it for writing
afterwards). I had a talk on this topic at the last LSF/MM/BPF summit[1]
-- I have since reworked the design to block operations in a far more
systematic manner but I'm still playing around with prototypes at the
moment.

Package        : runc
Version        : 1.0.0~rc6+dfsg1-3+deb10u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-43784 CVE-2024-21626
Debian Bug     :

runc is a command line client for running applications packaged according
to the Open Container Format (OCF) and is a compliant implementation of
the Open Container Project specification.

CVE-2021-43784

   A flaw has been detected that may lead to a possible length field
   overflow, allowing user-controlled data to be parsed as control
   characters.

CVE-2024-21626

   A flaw has been detected which allows several container breakouts
   due to internally leaked file descriptors. The patch includes fixes
   and hardening measurements against these types of issues/attacks.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1.0.0~rc6+dfsg1-3+deb10u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your runc packages.

For the detailed security status of runc please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/runc>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2258725#c0)  Avinash Hanwate    2024-01-17 05:00:08 UTC  ``` The core issue is a file descriptor leak, and while we do `O_CLOEXEC` all file descriptors before executing the container code, the file descriptor is open when doing `setcwd(2)` which means that the reference can be kept alive into the container by configuring the working directory to be a path resolved through the file descriptor (and the non-dumpable bit is unset after `execve` meaning that there are multiple ways to attack this other than bad configurations).  There is also an `execve`-based attack that makes simple verification unworkable was particularly hairy to fix (the patch involves doing `//go:linkname` to access Go runtime internals, because the only way to defend against it entirely is to close all unneeded file descriptors -- for the same reason that #!-based tricks meant that [CVE-2019-5736](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-5736) required drastic measures).   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2258725#c4)  Pedro Sampaio    2024-01-31 21:31:54 UTC  ``` Created

|  |  | ### Security |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* Fix [CVE-2024-21626][cve-2024-21626], a container breakout attack that took |
|  |  | advantage of a file descriptor that was leaked internally within runc (but |
|  |  | never leaked to the container process). In addition to fixing the leak, |
|  |  | several strict hardening measures were added to ensure that future internal |
|  |  | leaks could not be used to break out in this manner again. Based on our |
|  |  | research, while no other container runtime had a similar leak, none had any |
|  |  | of the hardening steps we've introduced (and some runtimes would not check |
|  |  | for any file descriptors that a calling process may have leaked to them, |
|  |  | allowing for container breakouts due to basic user error). |
