- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect default permissions on the installation folder and its subfolders/files of the AMD Cloud Manageability Service (ACMS) software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inappropriately configured Access Control List (ACL) permissions. The software inherits permissions from the parent folder during installation, and these inherited permissions are not secure enough.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Lower privileged users can escalate privileges, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access. An attacker with low privileges on a system with the vulnerable software can exploit the incorrect permissions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have low-privileged access to the system where the vulnerable AMD Cloud Manageability Service (ACMS) Software is installed and must be able to execute code with user interaction.
