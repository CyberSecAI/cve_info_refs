# Azure IoT Platform Device SDK Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

Moderate

[ericwolz](/ericwolz)
published
GHSA-j29m-p99g-7hpv
Jan 8, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<2023-12-01

## Patched versions

## Description

### Impact

The uAMQP is a C library for AMQP 1.0 communication to Azure Cloud Services. This library may be used by the Azure IoT C SDK for communication between IoT Hub and IoT Hub devices if the preferred protocol to the hub service is the AMQP protocol. These devices could be embedded devices (running an embedded OS such as FreeRTOS or Azure RTOS), as well as Linux and Windows based devices.

The vulnerability results from a situation where the uAMQP library attempts to free the same memory location twice while processing an incorrect “AMQP\_VALUE” failed state which may lead to possible RCE. This may occur when a memory allocation has failed (usually due to a low memory event) or an AMQP protocol violation.

Requirements for RCE:

1. Compromised Azure account allowing malformed payloads to be sent to the device via IoT Hub service
2. Low memory device condition triggering failed memory allocation
3. Ability to overwrite code space with remote code.

### Patches

Update submodule with commit [12ddb3a](https://github.com/Azure/azure-uamqp-c/commit/12ddb3a31a5a97f55b06fa5d74c59a1d84ad78fe)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L
