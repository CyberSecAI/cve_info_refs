- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the NPU driver.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The NPU driver does not properly validate input, which could allow an attacker to supply a specially crafted pointer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** A local attacker with low privileges can exploit the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted pointer as input to the NPU driver.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to run code on a machine with the vulnerable AMD Ryzen AI software.
