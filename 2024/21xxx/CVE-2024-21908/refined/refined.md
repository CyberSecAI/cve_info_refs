Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-21908:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the schema validation logic of the core parser in TinyMCE. Specifically, the parser did not perform schema validation after unwrapping invalid elements.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the editor.
- This malicious code could be executed when the content is published outside the editor, potentially leading to:
    - Data theft
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement
    - Other malicious activities

**Attack vectors:**
- Inserting specially crafted content into the editor via:
    - Clipboard
    - Editor APIs

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to insert content into a TinyMCE editor.
- No special privileges are required, as the vulnerability can be triggered with user interaction.
- The attacker can be remote since it's a web-based attack

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects TinyMCE versions prior to 5.9.0.
- The vulnerability is fixed in TinyMCE version 5.9.0 by ensuring schema validation is still performed after unwrapping invalid elements.
- A workaround is to manually sanitize content using the `BeforeSetContent` event.

**CVSS Score:**
- 6.1 (Moderate)

**CVSS Vector:**
- CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

**EPSS Score**
- 1.568% (87th percentile)
