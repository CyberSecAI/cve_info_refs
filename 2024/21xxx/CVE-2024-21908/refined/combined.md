## Description

### Impact

A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the schema validation logic of the core parser. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when inserting a specially crafted piece of content into the editor using the clipboard or editor APIs. This malicious content could then end up in content published outside the editor, if no server-side sanitization was performed. This impacts all users who are using TinyMCE 5.8.2 or lower.

### Patches

This vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 5.9.0 by ensuring schema validation was still performed after unwrapping invalid elements.

### Workarounds

To work around this vulnerability, either:

* Upgrade to TinyMCE 5.9.0 or higher
* Manually sanitize the content using the `BeforeSetContent` event (see below)

#### Example: Manually sanitize content

```
editor.on('BeforeSetContent', function(e) {
  var sanitizedContent = ...; // Manually sanitize content here
  e.content = sanitizedContent;
});
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

`table_background_color_map`

Allows setting a specific set of background colors to be used by the `tablecellbackgroundcolor` toolbar button and menu item, overriding the defaults and the colors provided by the [`color_map` option](../content-appearance/#color_map). For information on this option, see: [Table options - table\_background\_color\_map](../table/#table_background_color_map).

`table_border_color_map`

### Additional new features

TinyMCE 5.9 introduces the following minor new features:

* Added new plugin commands:

  + `mceEmoticons` opens the Emoticons dialog.
  + `mceWordCount` displays the Word Count summary dialog.
  + `mceTemplate` shows the Template dialog.
* A new `iframe_aria_text` option for customizing the `title` attribute on the editor iframe. For details, see: [Accessibility options - `iframe_aria_text`](../accessibility/#iframe_aria_text).
* Added a new `mceFocus` command that focuses the editor. Equivalent to using `editor.focus()`.
* Added a new `table-row-numbering` icon.
* Added a new DomParser `Node.children()` API to return all the children of a `Node`.

## Enhancements

The following enhancements were made for the TinyMCE 5.9 release.

### Improved context toolbar user experience

TinyMCE 5.9 improves context toolbar positioning by ensuring the toolbar remains in the same position when the user scrolls. Additionally, the context toolbar repositions if the toolbar will overlap the selected content or the cursor. For example: Prior to this improvement, if a user was editing a table, the context toolbar may have covered cells in the first row while it was being edited. Now, when clicking into any cell within that row, the toolbar will move to the bottom of the viewport instead.

To further enhance the user experience, the context toolbar will now use a short animation when the toolbar transitions between different locations.

![Enchanced context toolbar behavior](../_images/context-toolbar-improvements.gif)

For information on context toolbars, see: [UI components - Context toolbar](../contexttoolbar/).

### New `toolbar_sticky_offset` option for customizing sticky toolbars

The new `toolbar_sticky_offset` option allows the main toolbar to "dock" at a specified offset from the top or bottom of the view, depending on the toolbar location (set using the [`toolbar_location` option](../editor-appearance/#toolbar_location)).

For information on the `toolbar_sticky_offset` option, see: [User interface options - toolbar\_sticky\_offset](../editor-appearance/#toolbar_sticky_offset).

### Enhanced UI rendering performance

The User Interface has been profiled to find performance bottlenecks and a number of improvements have been made to increase the rendering speed. TinyMCE 5.9 should now be up to 20% faster at rendering the UI components, which also leads to an improved editor initialization time.

### Additional enhancements

TinyMCE 5.9 introduces the following minor enhancements:

* Fancy menu items now accept an `initData` property to allow custom initialization data.
* Improved the load time of the `fullpage` plugin by using the existing editor schema rather than creating a new one.
* `Env.browser` now uses the User-Agent Client Hints API where it is available.
* Icons with a `-rtl` suffix in their name will now automatically be used when the UI is rendered in right-to-left mode.
* The `formatter.match` API now accepts an optional `similar` parameter to check if the format partially matches.
* The `formatter.formatChanged` API now supports providing format variables when listening for changes.
* The formatter will now fire `FormatApply` and `FormatRemove` events for the relevant actions.
* The `autolink` plugin link detection now permits custom protocols.
* The `autolink` plugin valid link detection has been improved.

## Functionality changes

The following functionality changes were made for the TinyMCE 5.9 release:

* Changed the load order so content CSS is loaded before the editor is populated with content.
* Changed the `emoticons`, `wordcount`, `code`, `codesample`, and `template` plugins to open dialogs using commands.
* The context toolbar will no longer show an arrow when it overlaps the content, such as in table cells.
* The context toolbar will no longer overlap the statusbar for toolbars using `node` or `selection` positions.

## Accompanying Premium Plugin changes

The following premium plugin updates were released alongside TinyMCE 5.9.

### Advanced Tables 1.1.0

The TinyMCE 5.9 release includes an accompanying release of the **Advanced Tables** premium plugin.

**Advanced Tables** 1.1.0 provides the following new features:

This release adds row numbering functionality, allowing users to add (and remove) row numbering columns on tables. For details, see: [Advanced Tables plugin - Adding row numbering to a table](../advtable/#addingrownumberingtoatable). This includes:

* Added a new `advtable_value_series` option.
* Added a new `mceTableToggleSeries` command.

For information on the Advanced Tables plugin, see: [Advanced Tables plugin](../advtable/).

### Mentions 2.3.0

The TinyMCE 5.9 release includes an accompanying release of the **Mentions** premium plugin.

**Mentions** 2.3.0 adds the "profile" card feature to the `mentions_menu_hover` callback.

**Mentions** 2.3.0 also fixes the "profile" cards not displaying the `fullName` property when available.

### PowerPaste 5.6.0

The TinyMCE 5.9 release includes an accompanying release of the **PowerPaste** premium plugin.

**PowerPaste** 5.6.0 introduces the following enhancements:

* The `powerpaste_word_import`, `powerpaste_googledocs_import`, and `powerpaste_html_import` options now also accept asynchronous functions. This allows the paste mode to be dynamically set each time a user pastes relevant content. It is designed to be used, for example, to replicate the `prompt` dialog with a custom dialog.
* More URLs can now be detected with the `smart_paste` option. Specifically, custom URL scheme detection is more accurate. For more information on URL schemes, see: [What is a URL - Scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL#scheme).

**PowerPaste** 5.6.0 provides the following bug fixes:

* Word content was incorrectly parsed when copied from a German user interface.
* Paste incorrectly inserted content when the editor was in readonly mode.

For information on the PowerPaste plugin, see: [PowerPaste plugin](../introduction-to-powerpaste/).

### Real-time Collaboration 1.0.1

## General bug fixes

TinyMCE 5.9 provides fixes for the following bugs:

* The `editor.fire` API was incorrectly mutating the original `args` provided.
* Unbinding an event handler did not take effect immediately while the event was firing.
* Binding an event handler incorrectly took effect immediately while the event was firing.
* Unbinding a native event handler inside the `remove` event caused an exception that blocked editor removal.
* The `SetContent` event contained the incorrect `content` when using the `editor.selection.setContent()` API.
* The editor content could be edited after calling `setProgressState(true)` in iframe mode.
* Tabbing out of the editor after calling `setProgressState(true)` behaved inconsistently in iframe mode.
* Flash of unstyled content while loading the editor because the content CSS was loaded after the editor content was rendered.
* Partially transparent RGBA values provided in the `color_map` setting were given the wrong hex value.
* HTML comments with mismatched quotes were parsed incorrectly under certain circumstances.
* The editor could crash when inserting certain HTML content.
* Links in notification text did not show the correct mouse pointer.
* Using the Tab key to navigate into the editor on Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 would incorrectly focus the toolbar.
* The editor selection could be placed in an incorrect location when undoing or redoing changes in a document containing `contenteditable="false"` elements.
* Menus and context menus were not closed when clicking into a different editor.
* Context menus on Android were not displayed when more than one HTML element was selected.
* Disabled nested menu items could still be opened.
* The nested menu item chevron icon was not fading when the menu item was disabled.
* `imagetools` buttons were incorrectly enabled for remote images without `imagetools_proxy` set.
* Only table content would be deleted when partially selecting a table and content outside the table.
* The table cell selection handling was incorrect in some cases when dealing with nested tables.
* Removing a table row or column could result in the cursor getting placed in an invalid location.
* Pressing the Tab key to navigate through table cells did not skip noneditable cells.
* Clicking on a noneditable table cell did not show a visual selection like other noneditable elements.
* Some table operations would incorrectly cause table row attributes and styles to be lost.
* The selection was incorrectly lost when using the `mceTableCellType` and `mceTableRowType` commands.
* The `mceTableRowType` was reversing the order of the rows when converting multiple header rows back to body rows.
* The table dialog did not always respect the `table_style_with_css` option.
* Pasting into a table with multiple cells selected could cause the content to be pasted in the wrong location.
* The `TableModified` event was not fired when pasting cells into a table.
* The table paste column before and after icons were not flipped in RTL mode.
* Fixed table corruption when deleting a `contenteditable="false"` cell.
* The `dir` attribute was being incorrectly applied to list items.
* Applying selector formats would sometimes not apply the format correctly to elements in a list.
* For formats that specify an attribute or style that should be removed, the formatter `match` API incorrectly returned `false`.
* The type signature on the `formatter.matchNode` API had the wrong return type (was `boolean` but should have been `Formatter | undefined`).
* The `formatter.formatChanged` API would ignore the `similar` parameter if another callback had already been registered for the same format.
* The `formatter.formatChanged` API would sometimes not run the callback the first time the format was removed.
* Base64 encoded images with spaces or line breaks in the data URI were not displayed correctly. Patch contributed by RoboBurned

## Security fixes

TinyMCE 5.9 provides fixes for the following security issues:

* Inserting certain HTML content into the editor could result in invalid HTML once parsed. This caused a medium severity Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Tiny Technologies would like to thank William Bowling for discovering this vulnerability.
* The `.war` files for the premium self-hosted server-side components have been updated to address various high and medium severity security issues.

## Known issues

This section describes issues that users of TinyMCE 5.9 may encounter and possible workarounds for these issues.

* [Core known issues](#coreknownissues)
* [Table plugin known issues](#tablepluginknownissues)
* [Real-time Collaboration (RTC) known issues](#real-timecollaborationrtcknownissues)

### Core known issues

#### "Right-hand side of 'instanceof' is not callable" or "Event is not a function. (evaluating 'e instanceof Event')" exceptions

Issue

This issue affects developers who have overridden the native browser `Event` window object, such as those seen in some Vue.js tutorials. This breaks the native `Event` API which TinyMCE 5.9 makes use of.

Solution

Ensure that the `Event` window or global object is not overridden in your code. The cases reported to Tiny use something similar to `window.Event = new Vue();`. This should be renamed to something that does not conflict with a browser API, such as `window.EventBus = new Vue();`.
Tiny highly recommends against overriding any built-in browser APIs, as the editor relies on built-in browser API behavior to function as expected.

### Table plugin known issues

#### The new table color map settings do not apply to color pickers in the table dialogs

Issue

This issue affects the new `table_background_color_map` and `table_border_color_map` options. Setting these options will change the set of colors used in their respective toolbar buttons and menu items, but not the table dialog.

Workaround

There was no known workaround at the time of the release.

#### Issues with the new *Table Column Header* and *Table Row Header* toolbar buttons and menu items

Issue

This issue affects users of the new `tablecolheader` and `tablerowheader` toolbar buttons and menu items. Toggling off column or row headers may result in a cell being converted into a normal cell when still part of a header row or column.

Workaround

There was no known workaround at the time of the release.

### Real-time Collaboration (RTC) known issues

#### Users are unable to add content below an Horizontal Rule (`hr`) if inserted on the last line

Issue

If an `hr` is inserted at the end of the editor content, placing the cursor below it overwrites the `hr`.

Workaround

There was no known workaround at the time of the release.

#### Circumstances where users are unable to clear content formatting

Issue

The clear formatting feature only works with a selection across the text to be cleared.

Workaround

There was no known workaround at the time of the release.

#### Possibility of inconsistent undo operations

Issue

After adding content locally, when remote users edit that same content, local undo might not work or might remove more text than expected. This will not remove remote content.

Workaround

There was no known workaround at the time of the release.

#### Inconsistent editor scrolling behavior when multiple users are editing various areas of a document

Issue

When the caret is not visible, remote changes might scroll the editor to make the caret visible.

Workaround

There was no known workaround at the time of the release.

#### Connection issues may occur when users delete large sections of content while multiple users are editing

Issue

Deleting large sections of content (either deliberately or using undo) may result in a disconnection from the server.

Workaround

There was no known workaround at the time of the release.

#### Errors and warnings present in the JavaScript developer console

Issue

Several errors and warnings may be shown in the developer console (for example, opening some format menus).

Workaround

There was no known workaround at the time of the release.

## Upgrading to the latest version of TinyMCE 5

The procedure for upgrading to the latest version of TinyMCE 5 depends on the deployment type.

* [Upgrading Tiny Cloud](#upgradingtinycloud).
* [Upgrading TinyMCE Self-hosted manually](#upgradingtinymceself-hostedmanually).

### Upgrading Tiny Cloud

Tiny Cloud provides the latest enterprise version of TinyMCE. For information on configuring Tiny Cloud, see: [the Cloud deployment guide](../cloud-deployment-guide/).

### Upgrading TinyMCE Self-hosted manually

To upgrade to TinyMCE 5.10 using a manually downloaded package:

1. Backup the `tinymce/` directory so any customizations can be restored after the upgrade.

   Customizations for TinyMCE are typically stored in the following directories:

   ```
   tinymce/
   âââ icons/
   âââ langs/
   âââ plugins/
   âââ skins/
   â   âââ content/
   â   âââ ui/
   âââ themes/
   ```
2. Download the latest version of TinyMCE.

   * For the TinyMCE Community Version, download `tinymce_<VERSION>.zip` from [Get TinyMCE - Self-hosted releases](https://www.tiny.cloud/get-tiny/self-hosted/), where `<VERSION>` is the latest version of TinyMCE.
   * For the TinyMCE Enterprise Version, download the **TinyMCE Enterprise Bundle** from [Tiny Account > Downloads](https://www.tiny.cloud/my-account/downloads/). The downloaded file will be named `enterprise_latest.zip`.
3. Extract the downloaded `.zip` file to a temporary location.
4. (If required) Install the latest language packs from [Get TinyMCE - Language Packages](https://www.tiny.cloud/get-tiny/language-packages/).
5. Copy customizations to the new `tinymce/` directory. Ensure that *only custom changes* are added the new `tinymce/` directory, such as:

   * Custom icons packs
   * Custom plugins
   * Custom skins
   * Custom themes
6. Delete the existing `tinymce/` directory and replace with the new `tinymce/`.

|  | To simplify the upgrade process to future versions of TinyMCE:   1. Host the TinyMCE customizations outside of the `tinymce/` directory. 2. Update your TinyMCE configuration as required:     * Set the location of content CSS customizations using [`content_css`](../content-appearance/#content_css).    * Set the location of custom plugins using [`external_plugins`](../integration-and-setup/#external_plugins).    * Set the location of custom icon packages using [`icons_url`](../editor-appearance/#icons_url) instead of `icons`.    * Set the location of custom localization packages using [`language_url`](../content-localization/#language_url) instead of `language`.    * Set the location of custom skin packages using [`skin_url`](../editor-appearance/#skin_url) instead of `skin`.    * Set the location of custom themes using [`theme_url`](../editor-appearance/#theme_url) instead of `theme`. |

# Cross-site scripting vulnerability in TinyMCE

Moderate

[lnewson](/lnewson)
published
GHSA-5h9g-x5rv-25wg
Oct 21, 2021

## Package

tinymce
(npm composer nuget)

## Affected versions

< 5.9.0

## Patched versions

5.9.0

## Description

### Impact

A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the schema validation logic of the core parser. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when inserting a specially crafted piece of content into the editor using the clipboard or editor APIs. This malicious content could then end up in content published outside the editor, if no server-side sanitization was performed. This impacts all users who are using TinyMCE 5.8.2 or lower.

### Patches

This vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 5.9.0 by ensuring schema validation was still performed after unwrapping invalid elements.

### Workarounds

To work around this vulnerability, either:

* Upgrade to TinyMCE 5.9.0 or higher
* Manually sanitize the content using the `BeforeSetContent` event (see below)

#### Example: Manually sanitize content

```
editor.on('BeforeSetContent', function(e) {
  var sanitizedContent = ...; // Manually sanitize content here
  e.content = sanitizedContent;
});
```
### Acknowledgements

Tiny Technologies would like to thank William Bowling for discovering this vulnerability.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
