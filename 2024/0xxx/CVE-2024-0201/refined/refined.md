The provided content is related to CVE-2024-0201.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `save_settings` function of the Product Expiry for WooCommerce plugin. This function is responsible for saving plugin settings, but it lacks a capability check to ensure that only users with appropriate permissions (typically administrators) can modify these settings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing authorization check in `save_settings` function.
- The plugin uses `wp_ajax_woope_save_admin_settings` action which is available for all authenticated users.
- Failure to verify user capabilities before allowing plugin settings modifications.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Authenticated users with low-level permissions (like subscribers) can modify the plugin's settings.
- Attackers could potentially manipulate the display of expiry dates and notices on the frontend, in order emails, and in the admin order view. 
- Attackers could modify the notification email settings, which may lead to information disclosure or disruption.
- Although the impact of modification is limited, it can create annoyance or confusion.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network access: Attacker sends a request to the vulnerable endpoint to save the settings.
- The vulnerability is triggered through the WordPress AJAX interface via the action `wp_ajax_woope_save_admin_settings`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user with at least subscriber-level permissions.
- No special network position is required, any authenticated user can make the request to the vulnerable endpoint to update the settings.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability has been fixed in version 2.6 of the plugin by adding a nonce verification and capability check to the `save_settings` function.
- CVE-2023-52179 has been noted as a duplicate of this issue.
- The plugin's settings include options for the single product hook, archive hook, date format, notification emails, display settings, order details settings, and markup.
