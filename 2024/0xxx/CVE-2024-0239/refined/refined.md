- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites. The vulnerability can be used against administrators.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL with the `log` parameter containing JavaScript code, and tricking a user into clicking the crafted link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking the link, which would lead to the malicious script being executed.
