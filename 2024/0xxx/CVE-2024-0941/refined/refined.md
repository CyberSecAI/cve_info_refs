Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the SQL injection vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the insecure way the `sort` and `order` parameters are handled in the `BookCommentMapper.xml` file. Specifically, the use of the `${}` syntax in the MyBatis XML mapping file directly concatenates the provided user input into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct embedding of user-controlled parameters into the SQL query string.
    *   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application doesn't sanitize user input before using it to construct the SQL query.
    *   **Use of `${}`:** MyBatis' `${}` syntax is designed to insert the literal value of a property into the query string, which makes it susceptible to SQL injection when used with user input.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Database Compromise:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code to access, modify, or delete sensitive data in the database.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can retrieve confidential information from the database, including user credentials and other private data.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the database user's permissions, attackers might be able to gain control over the entire database server.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exposed through the `/novel/bookComment/list` endpoint via HTTP GET requests. The `sort` and `order` parameters within this request are the attack vectors.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected application and the `/novel/bookComment/list` endpoint.
    *   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `sort` and `order` parameters are vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `/novel/bookComment/list` interface of the `novel-admin` subsystem within the `novel-plus` system.
*   The vulnerable code path starts at `BookCommentController`, proceeds to `BookCommentServiceImpl`, and finally reaches `BookCommentMapper`.
*   The vulnerable code is in the `BookCommentMapper.xml` where the sort and order parameters are used in the following way:
```xml
<if test="sort != null and sort != '' and order != null and order != ''">
        order by ${sort} ${order}
</if>
```
*   A sample payload is provided:
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:8088/novel/bookComment/list?limit=10&offset=0&sort=id AND (SELECT 9288 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))OHwd)&order=desc
    ```
*   The content also shows that `sqlmap` can be used to verify the vulnerability and extract database names.

This information provides a clear understanding of the SQL injection vulnerability present in the `novel-plus` system.
