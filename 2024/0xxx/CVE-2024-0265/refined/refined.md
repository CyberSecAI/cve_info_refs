{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `page` GET parameter in `index.php` is directly included in a PHP `include()` function without any sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability. The application includes files based on user-controlled input without proper validation or sanitization, making it vulnerable to LFI.",
       "The application uses a flawed logic check for form tokens in `LoginRegistration.php` and `Master.php`. Sending a blank `formToken` bypasses the token validation."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) by exploiting the LFI vulnerability using PHP filter chains. This can lead to complete compromise of the system.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker can send a crafted GET request to `index.php` with a malicious value in the `page` parameter, allowing them to include and execute arbitrary PHP code via PHP filters.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application. No authentication is needed to exploit the LFI directly, but the linked exploit chains an authorization bypass to enable access to the vulnerable endpoints. "
  },
  "additional_notes": "The provided exploit code chains an Authorization Bypass (CVE-2024-0264) with the Local File Inclusion (CVE-2024-0265) to achieve RCE. The authorization bypass is achieved by sending a blank `formToken` in the request, while the LFI is exploited using PHP filter chains to execute arbitrary code. The exploit is a python script (`clinicx.py`) that automates this process."
