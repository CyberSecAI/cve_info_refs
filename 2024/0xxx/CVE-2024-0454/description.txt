ELAN Match-on-Chip FPR solution has design fault about potential risk of valid SID leakage and enumeration with spoof sensor.
This fault leads to that Windows Hello recognition would be bypass with cloning SID to cause broken account identity.
Version which is lower than 3.0.12011.08009(Legacy)/3.3.12011.08103(ESS) would suffer this risk on DELL Inspiron platform.
