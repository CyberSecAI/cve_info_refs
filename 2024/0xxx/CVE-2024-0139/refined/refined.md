- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insecure temporary file vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software uses temporary files insecurely, potentially allowing a malicious actor to manipulate them.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to a denial of service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required, and user interaction is also required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs local access with low privileges, and they also need to induce the victim to perform an action on the file.
