Our privacy policy
**HELPSYSTEMS PRIVACY POLICY**

Your privacy is very important to us. HelpSystems respects your privacy and is committed to protect the personal information that you share with us. Generally, you can browse through our website without giving us any information about yourself. When we do need your personal information to provide services that you request or when you choose to provide us with your personal information, this policy describes how we collect and use your personal information.

If you have additional questions, you may send email to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

**Overview**

The privacy practices of this statement apply to our services available under the domains and subdomains of goanywhere.com and helpsystems.com (the "Site"). By visiting this Site you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

**1. Protection of Children's Personal Information**

This Site is a general audience site and does not knowingly collect any personal information from children.

**2. Information We Collect.**

Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience safer and easier. We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose.

In general, you can browse the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. If you choose to use our services, we may require you to provide contact and identity information, billing information, shipping information and other personal information as indicated on the forms throughout the Site. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature.

**3. Our Use of Your Information.**

We may use information for several general purposes: to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, to personalize your experience on our website, to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers or other information we think you'd like to hear about either from us or from our business partners, and to better understand your needs and provide you with better services. We may also use your information to send you, or to have our business partners send you, direct marketing information or contact you for market research.

You agree that we may use personal information about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze site usage, improve our content and product offerings, and customize the Site's content, layout, and services. These uses improve the Site and better tailor it to meet your needs, so as to provide you with a smooth, efficient, safe and customized experience while using the Site.

You agree that we or our business partners may use your personal information to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, are targeted to your interests, such as targeted advertisements, administrative notices, product offerings, and communications relevant to your use of the Site. By accepting the User Agreement and Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to receive this information. If you do not wish to receive these communications, we encourage you to opt out of the receipt of certain communications by sending an email to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) to opt-out. You may make changes to your notification preferences at any time.

**4. Use of Cookies.**

Our site uses Cookies to collect and store information about you and your connection to our site. The cookie that our site generates is a small computer file that is transferred to your computer systems through your browser. It functions as an identification card recording Group/Practice/Client specific data that increases security and helps navigation through our site. It cannot be used to deliver viruses, allow access, or execute code on your system.

**5. Our Disclosure of Your Information.**

As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. However, the following describes some of the ways that your personal information may be disclosed.

Legal Requests. HelpSystems cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws. Therefore, in response to a verified request by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, city, state, telephone number and email address without a subpoena.

**6. How You Can Update, Correct or Delete Your Information.**

You may send an email at anytime to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) to update, correct or delete personal information or to stop receiving promotional e-mail.

**7. Security.**

Your information is stored on the HelpSystems servers located in the United States. We use procedural and technical safeguards to protect your personal information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your privacy, including encryption, "firewalls" and Secure Socket Layers. We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.

**8. Notice.**

We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amend terms on the Site. All amended terms shall automatically be effective 30 days after they are initially posted on the Site. In addition, we will notify you in accordance with your Notification Preferences.
