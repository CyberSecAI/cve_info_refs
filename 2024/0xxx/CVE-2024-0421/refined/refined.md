The provided content is related to CVE-2024-0421.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The MapPress Maps for WordPress plugin is vulnerable to an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability. The plugin doesn't properly verify if a post being retrieved via an AJAX action is a public map, which allows unauthenticated users to access arbitrary private and draft posts. The initial fix in version 2.88.15 was insufficient as it still allowed authenticated users with subscriber roles to read private and draft posts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
- Broken Access Control

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthenticated users can read the content of arbitrary private and draft posts.

**Attack vectors:**
- Unauthenticated users can craft a specific URL with a target post ID and nonce. The nonce can be obtained from the source code of a page containing a map from the plugin.
- The vulnerable AJAX action is `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=mapp_get_post&oid=[POST_ID]&nonce=[NONCE]`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs access to the website.
- The attacker needs to be able to view the source code of a page using the vulnerable plugin in order to obtain a valid nonce, then they must craft an exploit URL with the desired post ID and nonce.
