The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the `pay.php` file of the SourceCodester Online Tours & Travels Management System.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application constructs a SQL query using unsanitized input from the `id` parameter passed via a GET request. Specifically, the `prepare()` function in `pay.php` at line 16 uses this untrusted data directly.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability exists in `pay.php`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could modify the meaning of SQL statements or execute arbitrary SQL commands. This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, data manipulation, and other malicious activities on the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessible through the `id` parameter in a GET request to `admin/pay.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application, specifically targeting the vulnerable `admin/pay.php` endpoint with malicious SQL code in the `id` parameter.

**Additional details:**
- The provided content includes examples of payloads used by `sqlmap` to identify different types of SQL injection vulnerabilities (error-based, stacked queries, time-based blind, and UNION query).
- The vulnerable code is located in `pay.php` line 16 within the admin folder.
