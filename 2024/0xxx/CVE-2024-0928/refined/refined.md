The content is related to CVE-2024-0928.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack buffer overflow occurs in the `fromDhcpListClient` function of the Tenda AC10U router firmware due to insecure string formatting using `sprintf`. The `page` parameter, received via `websGetVar`, is concatenated with other strings and stored in the `gotopage` buffer. If the supplied `page` parameter is too large, it can overflow this buffer on the stack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a classic stack-based buffer overflow caused by unbounded string concatenation using `sprintf`. Specifically, the code does not check the size of the user-supplied input (`page` parameter) before concatenating it into a fixed-size buffer, `gotopage`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the device. This could allow for complete control of the router, enabling a range of malicious activities, such as network manipulation, data interception, or use of the compromised device in botnets.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/DhcpListClient` endpoint of the router's web interface, with an overly large value supplied for the `page` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. This implies they must be on the same network as the router, or have the router's web interface accessible via the internet.
