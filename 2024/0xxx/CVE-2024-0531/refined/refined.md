{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `parse_macfilter_rule` function uses `strcpy` to copy the `deviceList` parameter to the `dest_rule->name` variable without any length checks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit can lead to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack and potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE).",
    "attack_vectors": "Sending a crafted POST request to `/goform/setBlackRule` with an overly long `deviceList` parameter.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device. No authentication is explicitly mentioned but may be required depending on the device's configuration."
  },
  "affected_product": {
    "vendor": "Tenda",
    "product": "A15",
    "version": "US_A15V1.0RTL_V15.13.07.13_multi_TD01"
  },
    "poc": "The provided PoC demonstrates how an attacker can trigger the overflow by sending a POST request with a crafted deviceList payload of length 0x400 and including '\\r'.",
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability exists in the `formAddMacfilterRule` function and the overflow occurs in the `parse_macfilter_rule` function. The vulnerability was discovered by Chenjun Ma from Wuhan University."
