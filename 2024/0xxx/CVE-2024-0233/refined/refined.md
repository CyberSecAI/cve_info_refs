- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugins (EventON and eventon-lite) fail to properly sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back in pages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by making a logged-in administrator open a crafted page with malicious JavaScript in the `eid` parameter of a form submitted to `admin-ajax.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a logged-in admin into visiting it. This requires social engineering or other means to get an admin user to open the crafted link.
