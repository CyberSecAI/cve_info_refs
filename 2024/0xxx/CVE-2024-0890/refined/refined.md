The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of the `$` placeholder symbol in the `/system/dept/edit` interface's `dataScope` parameter, which is then passed to a SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input being directly used in a SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion, as well as unauthorized access to sensitive data, as demonstrated in the provided example by reading the database user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited via an HTTP POST request to the `/system/dept/edit` endpoint.
- The `dataScope` parameter is the injection point, and the exploit is placed within this parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the application.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target endpoint.
- The attacker needs to have some understanding of SQL syntax.
- Based on the provided information, authentication does not seem to be a prerequisite for exploiting this vulnerability.
