- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A specially crafted container image can lead to the creation of unauthorized files on the host. The vulnerability is a result of a UNIX specific flaw.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability is a result of a design flaw in how the NVIDIA Container Toolkit and NVIDIA GPU Operator handle container images, leading to unauthorized file creation on the host system. The vulnerability is related to Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following').
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to data tampering. While the attacker cannot control the name and location of the created files, their creation itself is an impact.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a specially crafted container image.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the capability to create and run container images. The CVSS vector indicates that the attacker needs to have low privileges on the system, and the attack requires user interaction, which means the user needs to run the malicious container.
