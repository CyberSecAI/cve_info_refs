```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `fromNatStaticSetting` function retrieves the `page` parameter via `websGetVar`, which is then formatted using `sprintf` and concatenated with other strings into the `gotopage` variable. This allows for a stack-based buffer overflow if the size of the user-controlled input `page` exceeds the size of the destination buffer `gotopage`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow due to insecure use of sprintf and string concatenation with user-supplied input."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A stack overflow can lead to denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution on the affected device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/goform/NatStaticSetting` with an overly long value for the `page` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web interface of the Tenda AC10U router, typically requiring network access to the device."
