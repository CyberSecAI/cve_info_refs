The provided content describes a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in `channel.php` of a CMS, along with an SQL injection vulnerability used to exploit it.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   **LFI:** The `$t_path` variable is constructed using user-controlled input (`$_COOKIE['cms']['template_id']`) and the `$channel['c_cmodel']` is fetched from the database which an attacker can control, leading to the ability to include arbitrary local files.
*   **SQL Injection:** The `cms_admin.php` file lacks proper sanitization of user-provided input, allowing SQL injection through the `a_name` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The `channel.php` file includes files based on user controlled input via cookies and database, without proper sanitization.
*   **SQL Injection:** The `cms_admin.php` file is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing an attacker to manipulate database records. The vulnerable parameter is `a_name`.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The `arr_insert()` and `str_safe()` functions were intended to prevent malicious input but failed to do so. The `str_isafe()` function, while encoding `<script>` tags, didn't prevent other potentially harmful input.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **LFI:** An attacker can read sensitive files from the server's file system.
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can modify database records, in this case, to set the `c_cmodel` value to a malicious file path.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By combining the SQL injection to modify the database to set the `c_cmodel` to the path of an uploaded image webshell, the attacker can gain RCE.

**Attack vectors:**

1.  **SQL Injection:** The attacker crafts a malicious SQL query via the `a_name` parameter in a request to `cms_admin.php`.
2.  **Database Modification:** The attacker uses SQL injection to update the `c_cmodel` field in the `cms_channel` table to point to a malicious file (in this case, a webshell).
3.  **LFI Exploitation:** The attacker triggers the vulnerable `channel.php` script to include the malicious file specified in `c_cmodel`, resulting in code execution.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker needs to discover the SQL injection vulnerability in `cms_admin.php`.
*   The attacker needs to be able to upload an image file (webshell) to the server through the upload function, and obtain its path.
*   The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable LFI script in `channel.php` to trigger the LFI.
