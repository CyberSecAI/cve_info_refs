## JavaScript execution via malicious molfiles (XSS)

Moderate severity

[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-2pwh-52h7-7j84)
[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-2pwh-52h7-7j84/dependabot)

## Package

maven

de.ipb-halle:molecularfaces
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

< 0.3.0

## Patched versions

0.3.0

## Description

### Impact

The viewer plugin implementation of `<mol:molecule>` renders molfile data directly inside a `<script>` tag without any escaping. Arbitrary JavaScript code can thus be executed in the client browser via crafted molfiles.

### Patches

Patched in v0.3.0: Molfile data is now rendered as value of a hidden `<input>` tag and escaped via JSF's mechanisms.

### Workarounds

No workaround available.
