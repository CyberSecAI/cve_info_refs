It relies on the `hashids` library, which is inefficient at decoding such long strings, leading to excessive CPU and memory usage.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n- Inefficient processing of long, encoded IDs, which causes high CPU load and excessive memory allocation.

By sending requests with extremely long encoded IDs, the attacker can force the server to consume significant CPU and memory resources, leading to performance degradation or service unavailability.\n\nAttack vectors:\n- The attacker can send HTTP requests that include excessively long encoded IDs in the URL, either within the path segments or the query parameters.
