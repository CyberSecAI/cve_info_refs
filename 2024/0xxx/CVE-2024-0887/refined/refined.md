**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The server does not properly handle the string "Denial of Service" which results in a crash

**Impact of Exploitation:** A successful attack results in a denial of service, rendering the Blue Server software unusable.

**Attack Vectors:** Remote exploitation via network using TCP on port 80.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs network access to the server and the ability to send TCP packets on port 80.

**Additional Notes:**
