  "CVE-2024-0841": {
    "description": "A null pointer dereference flaw was found in the hugetlbfs_fill_super function in the Linux kernel hugetlbfs (HugeTLB pages) functionality. This issue may allow a local user to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a NULL pointer dereference in the `hugetlbfs_fill_super` function within the Linux kernel's hugetlbfs (HugeTLB pages) functionality. This occurs when an attempt is made to update the pagesize value with an invalid size using the fsconfig system call. This action eventually sets the hstate value to NULL through hugetlbfs_parse_param() when the value passed is not a valid page size. A subsequent update with the FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE option will cause a dereference to a NULL pointer within hugetlbfs_fill_super(), leading to a kernel panic.",

    "impact": "A local user can cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially escalate privileges.",
    "attack_vector": "Local user exploits the race condition to cause a use-after-free on a socket buffer.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local user with the ability to use the `fsconfig` system call."
