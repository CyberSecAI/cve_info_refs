Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-0965:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is improper access control within the Simple Page Access Restriction plugin, specifically when handling requests through the WordPress REST API. The plugin failed to properly enforce page access restrictions for unauthenticated users when content was accessed via the REST API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper access control for restricted content accessed via the REST API. The plugin's intended restriction logic was not being applied in the REST API context.
*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** This improper access control led to the exposure of sensitive information (the content of restricted pages) to unauthorized users, specifically unauthenticated users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers could bypass the intended page access restrictions and view the content of restricted pages without needing to log in.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Confidential or sensitive information intended only for logged-in users could be exposed to the public.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **REST API:** The vulnerability is specifically exploited through the WordPress REST API. Attackers can send requests to the REST API endpoints for restricted content.
*  **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users (users who are not logged into the WordPress site).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No special privileges needed:**  Attackers do not need any prior access or credentials on the target WordPress site.
*   **Network Access:** Attackers simply need network access to make requests to the site's REST API.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the Simple Page Access Restriction plugin up to and including 1.0.21.
*   The fix for this vulnerability was included in version 1.0.23 of the plugin, which introduces a new `add_checks_for_rest_api` function and the `check_page_access_for_rest_api` function. This function is called in the init hook. The function adds a filter on all registered post types for the rest api, to check if the page is restricted, and return a 403 error if it is.
*   The plugin now includes a "Redirect Parameter" setting, which is used when redirecting unauthorized users to a login page.

This information provides a good overview of the vulnerability. It highlights the issue with REST API access control, the impact of unauthorized content access, and the fix in the latest plugin version.
