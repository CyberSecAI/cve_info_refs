- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Web sessions in the management interface of Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software do not expire under certain conditions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient Session Expiration (CWE-613)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized access to the management interface due to unexpired sessions. This can lead to a compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the product.
- **Attack vectors:** Physical access to a device with an active but unexpired web session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs physical access to a device that has an active session to the PAN-OS web interface. The attacker also needs to passively interact with the user interface.
