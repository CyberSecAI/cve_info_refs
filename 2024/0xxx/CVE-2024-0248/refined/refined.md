Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The EazyDocs WordPress plugin re-introduced a vulnerability similar to CVE-2023-6029 in version 2.3.8, which was partially fixed in 2.3.9 but still allowed for arbitrary document deletion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Missing Authorization:** The plugin lacks proper authorization checks, allowing authenticated users with low privileges (like subscribers) to perform actions they shouldn't be able to do, such as deleting arbitrary posts and documents.
*   **Reintroduction of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability was previously patched (CVE-2023-6029) but was reintroduced.
*  **Insufficient Fix:** Version 2.3.9 only partially addresses the vulnerability, failing to prevent document deletion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Post Deletion (v2.3.8):** Attackers can delete any post on the WordPress site.
*   **Arbitrary Document Deletion (v2.3.8 and v2.3.9):** Attackers can delete documents managed by the plugin.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack is carried out via HTTP requests to the WordPress admin interface.
*   **Specific URL:** Attackers use the `admin-post.php` endpoint with crafted parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have a valid account on the WordPress site, with subscriber or higher level privileges.
*   **Knowledge of the plugin's internal structure:** The attacker needs to identify the `eazydocs_local_object` variable and extract nonce and post IDs.
*  **Ability to craft HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send a request to the specified URL with the correct parameters.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.4.0 of the plugin.
* The vulnerability is classified as a broken access control issue (OWASP A5), and relates to CWE-862 (Missing Authorization).
* The CVSS score is 6.5, indicating a medium severity.
