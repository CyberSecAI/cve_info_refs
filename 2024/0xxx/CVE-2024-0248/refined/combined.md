## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# EazyDocs < 2.4.0 - Subscriber+ Arbitrary Posts Deletion and Document Management

### Description

The plugin re-introduced CVE-2023-6029 (https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/7a0aaf85-8130-4fd7-8f09-f8edc929597e/) in 2.3.8, allowing any authenticated users, such as subscriber to delete arbitrary posts, as well as add and delete documents/sections. The issue was partially fixed in 2.3.9.

### Proof of Concept

v 2.3.8, same PoC than https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/7a0aaf85-8130-4fd7-8f09-f8edc929597e/
v 2.3.9 (can only delete arbitrary documents from the plugin)
1 - Login as a subscriber and view the source of the backend page.
2 - Search for `eazydocs\_local\_object` variable.
3 - Inside the variable, you will find the option tag containing the \_wpnonce and the post id.
4 - Change the value of the following URL with the data from step 3:
https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-post.php?Doc\_Delete=yes&\_wpnonce=<\_wpnonce>&DeleteID=<post\_id>
