  "CVE-2024-0556": {
    "root_cause": "Weak Cryptography for Passwords",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Passwords transmitted over the network are not encrypted using strong cryptographic algorithms.",
        "Passwords can be decoded using base64."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can intercept network traffic, retrieve user credentials, decode them from base64, and gain access to the user's credentials in plain text.",
    "attack_vectors": "Network traffic interception",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic. An attacker with network access can retrieve credentials. Low privileges are required as long as the attacker is on the same network as the target."
