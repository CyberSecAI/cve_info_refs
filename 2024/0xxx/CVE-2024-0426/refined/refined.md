The provided content is related to CVE-2024-0426.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability due to the lack of proper filtering of a parameter in `admin/cms_template.php`. This unfiltered parameter is directly included in an SQL statement, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection. The code does not sanitize the input before using it in an SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
- This could allow the attacker to access sensitive data in the database, modify data, or even gain control of the database server. In this specific example the attacker is extracting the current user being used by the SQL service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `admin/cms_template.php` file by manipulating an HTTP request parameter which is then directly included in the SQL query.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send requests to the vulnerable `admin/cms_template.php` endpoint and control the injected SQL parameter.
