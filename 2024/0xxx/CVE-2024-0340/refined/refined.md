{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from improper memory initialization in the `vhost_new_msg()` function within the Linux kernel's vhost module. Specifically, the memory for the 'msg' structure within a 'vhost_msg_node' is allocated using kmalloc and later zeroed with memset. However, this method leaves padding bytes uninitialized, potentially leaking sensitive kernel information to userspace.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Disclosure",
       "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "Local privileged users can read parts of kernel memory by accessing the `/dev/vhost-net` device file, leading to a potential information disclosure.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local Access",
      "Device File Interaction"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Local access with privileged user rights are required to exploit the vulnerability by accessing the /dev/vhost-net file."

  ],
   "additional_information": "The fix replaces `kmalloc` followed by `memset` with `kzalloc` in `vhost_new_msg` function, which ensures that all padding within the structure are zero initialized and thus prevent information leaks. The vulnerability affects the vhost module in the Linux kernel, which facilitates communication between virtual guests and the host operating system."
