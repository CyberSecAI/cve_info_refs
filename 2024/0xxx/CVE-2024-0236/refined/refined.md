The provided content is related to CVE-2024-0236.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in an AJAX action within the EventON and eventon-lite WordPress plugins.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The plugins fail to implement proper authorization controls for the `eventon_config_virtual_event` AJAX action. This allows unauthenticated users to access and execute this action.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerable AJAX action discloses sensitive information related to virtual events, including meeting passwords (e.g., for Zoom meetings).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker can retrieve sensitive configuration settings for virtual events, specifically meeting passwords. This could allow unauthorized access to private events.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `action=eventon_config_virtual_event` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of Event ID:** The attacker needs to know or guess the ID of a virtual event (the `eid` parameter).

**Technical Details:**
The provided Proof of Concept demonstrates how an unauthenticated user can exploit this vulnerability by sending the following HTTP POST request:

```
curl -X POST --data "eid=240" 'http://127.0.0.1/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=eventon_config_virtual_event'
```
This request retrieves the virtual event settings, which includes the meeting password.

**Affected Versions:**
- EventON (Free) versions prior to 2.2.8
- EventON (Premium) versions prior to 4.5.5
