{
  "CVE-2024-0562": {
    "Description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux Kernel. When a disk is removed, bdi_unregister is called to stop further write-back and waits for associated delayed work to complete. However, wb_inode_writeback_end() may schedule bandwidth estimation work after this has completed, which can result in the timer attempting to access the recently freed bdi_writeback.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability occurs due to a race condition in the writeback mechanism of the Linux kernel. Specifically, when a disk is removed, the bdi_unregister function is called to halt writeback operations. However, the wb_inode_writeback_end function might still schedule bandwidth estimation work after bdi_unregister has completed. This leads to a use-after-free scenario when the timer attempts to access the already freed bdi_writeback structure.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Race condition"
    ],
    "Impact": "The use-after-free vulnerability could lead to a system crash or potentially arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the memory allocation following the free. This can result in a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves removing a disk from the system, triggering the race condition in the kernel's writeback mechanism.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker would require the ability to remove a disk from the system. This implies having some level of access or control over the hardware or system management functions. Local access would be sufficient to trigger this bug."
