- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The NVIDIA Base Command Manager contains a missing authentication vulnerability in the CMDaemon component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing authentication (CWE-862)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks (AV:N), with low attack complexity (AC:L), no required privileges (PR:N), and no user interaction required (UI:N). The scope is unchanged (S:U).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker on the network can exploit this vulnerability without any prior privileges or user interaction.
