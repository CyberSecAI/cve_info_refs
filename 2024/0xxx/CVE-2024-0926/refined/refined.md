Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a stack-based buffer overflow in the `formWifiWpsOOB` function of the Tenda AC10U router firmware. The function insecurely uses `sprintf` to concatenate user-supplied input from the "index" parameter with fixed strings, without proper bounds checking, which can overwrite the stack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow. The `sprintf` function writes data to the `tmp` buffer without checking its size, allowing an attacker to write beyond the buffer's boundaries.
- **Insecure String Concatenation:** Using `sprintf` without limiting the input length leads to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** An attacker can overwrite the stack with arbitrary data. By crafting a specific payload, they can potentially gain control of the program's execution flow, enabling them to execute arbitrary code on the router.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The buffer overflow can lead to a crash of the router service or the entire device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/WifiWpsOOB` endpoint.
- **Malicious "index" Parameter:** The attacker provides an overly long string as the value of the "index" parameter in the POST request's data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the router to send the malicious HTTP POST request.
- **No Authentication Required** The provided code snippet does not show any authentication before sending the request

**Technical Details:**
- **Affected Function:** `formWifiWpsOOB`
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** `index`
- **Vulnerable Firmware Version:** US\_AC10UV1.0RTL\_V15.03.06.49\_multi\_TDE01
- **Buffer:** The `tmp` buffer where the input is concatenated.
- **Exploit Technique:** Exploiting the overflow with a large input for the `index` parameter to overwrite the stack.
- **Example Exploit (POC):**

```python
import requests
ip = '192.168.159.128'
url = f'http://{ip}/goform/WifiWpsOOB'
payload = {
    "index": 'a'*0x500
}
res = requests.post(url=url, data=payload)
print(res.content)
```
