The provided content describes a vulnerability in the EventON and eventon-lite WordPress plugins. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from missing authorization and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in certain AJAX actions of the plugins. Specifically, the `eventon_save_virtual_event_settings` and `eventon_save_virtual_mod_settings` actions lack proper checks, allowing unauthenticated users to modify virtual event settings.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Missing Authorization:** Unauthenticated users can directly call the vulnerable AJAX actions.
    *   **CSRF:** The absence of CSRF protection allows attackers to trick authenticated users into performing unwanted actions. Although the premium version attempted to fix this, it was flawed in implementation and was still exploitable.
    *   **Flawed Nonce Verification:** The nonce verification added in the premium plugin version 4.5.8 is flawed, which means that CSRF is still possible, despite the presence of some form of protection.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can:
    *   Change the meeting URL of a virtual event, potentially redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Assign any user as a moderator to a virtual event, potentially granting unauthorized access and control to the attacker.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint. Attackers craft malicious requests with specific parameters to the vulnerable actions, such as `eventon_save_virtual_event_settings` or `eventon_save_virtual_mod_settings`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the WordPress site. The attacker does not need to be authenticated for the basic attack, and can use CSRF to leverage authenticated users for the same attack even in the premium version.

The vulnerability is present in:
*   EventON Free versions prior to 2.2.9
*   EventON Premium versions prior to 4.5.9

The issue is fixed in EventON Free version 2.2.9 and EventON Premium version 4.5.9.
