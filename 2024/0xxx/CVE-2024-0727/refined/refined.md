  "CVE-2024-0727": {
    "Description": "Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may lead OpenSSL to crash leading to a potential Denial of Service attack. Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from untrusted sources might terminate abruptly. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but OpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12 files from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will be vulnerable to this issue. OpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are: PKCS12_parse(), PKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes() and PKCS12_newpass().",
    "Root cause": "The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but OpenSSL does not correctly check for this case.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to application crash.",
    "Attack vectors": "Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to provide an untrusted, maliciously crafted PKCS12 file to a vulnerable application."
