The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of the `$` placeholder symbol in the `/system/role/list` interface, which allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `dataScope` parameter, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data Breach: Attackers can use SQL injection to access, modify, or delete sensitive database information.
- Database takeover: Attackers can potentially gain full control of the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/system/role/list` endpoint. The malicious SQL code is injected through the `params[dataScope]` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint, and have knowledge of the application's structure to craft a working SQL injection.
- No authentication is mentioned, however, a session cookie is sent with the request.
