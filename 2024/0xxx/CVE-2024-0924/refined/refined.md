Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-0924 (based on the content provided, not from the official CVE description)

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Stack-based buffer overflow in the `formSetPPTPServer` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Insecure usage of `sscanf`:** The function uses `sscanf` with a format string `"%[^.].%[^.].%[^.].%s"` to parse the `startIp` parameter. The `%[^.]` format specifier matches any character that is not a dot (`.`), and `%s` matches any string until whitespace is encountered. These greedy matching specifiers, combined with an overly large input, can write beyond the allocated buffer on the stack if the input string does not conform to the expected format, i.e., four dot-separated sections of IP address.
*   **Lack of input validation:** The code doesn't properly validate the size of the `startIp` parameter before passing it to `sscanf`, making it possible to cause a buffer overflow by sending an overly long string for the `startIp` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Stack Overflow:** A successful exploit can lead to a stack overflow, potentially overwriting critical data on the stack, including the return address, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. This can cause denial of service (DoS), device compromise, or allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the device.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetPptpServerCfg` endpoint.
*   **`startIp` Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `startIp`. The attacker needs to provide an overly long string for the `startIp` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the device's web interface.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the URL path (`/goform/SetPptpServerCfg`) and parameter (`startIp`) used by the vulnerable function.

**Additional Details:**
*   **Vulnerable Firmware:** Tenda AC10U v1.0 US\_AC10UV1.0RTL\_V15.03.06.49\_multi\_TDE01 is the affected version.
*   **Proof of concept (PoC):** A python script is provided as a PoC that demonstrates the exploit, by sending a crafted `startIp` parameter with a long string of "a" characters.
*   **No fix available:** As of the content, no fix was available from the vendor.
