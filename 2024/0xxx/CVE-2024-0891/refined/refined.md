The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input when displaying notification announcements. Specifically, the application fails to neutralize or escape HTML special characters within the "noticeTitle" field before rendering them in the web page, allowing the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability: Malicious script is stored in the database and executed when the notification page is viewed by an authenticated user.
- Lack of input sanitization: The application does not sanitize user-provided input (specifically the notification title), leading to the injection of malicious HTML/JavaScript.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, such as the provided `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`, which will execute in the victimâ€™s browser when they view the notifications.
- Session hijacking: An attacker could steal the user's session cookies.
- Account compromise: By leveraging the stolen session cookies or further JavaScript exploits, an attacker might be able to compromise the user's account.
- Defacement: The attacker could modify the content of the page.
- Phishing: The attacker could redirect the user to a malicious site.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious payload (JavaScript code) within the notification title field while editing an announcement.
- The application then saves this payload to the database.
- When any authenticated user views the notification management page the malicious script will execute.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to be an authenticated user who has the permission to create and edit notification announcements.
- No specific network position is required as the exploit can be performed over the web application.
