        "root_cause": "The root cause is a flaw in the Linux kernel's Kernel Samepage Merging (KSM) mechanism, specifically how it handles maximum page sharing. The KSM component merges identical pages to save memory. However, a large number of merged pages can cause a performance issue during migration, leading to a soft lockup within VMs due to an extended semaphore lock hold during page migration. The vulnerability stems from the fact that the rmap_walk_ksm function can have an extremely long list of merged pages (stable_node->hlist), which takes a very long time to process during page migration.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Excessive page merging by KSM can lead to performance degradation.",
          "The migration of KSM pages is not efficiently handled, resulting in long lock holding times.",
          "The rmap_walk_ksm function can be slow when dealing with a large number of merged pages."
        ],
        "impact": "A virtual machine can experience soft lockups and become unresponsive when migrating KSM pages. Specifically, the numad kernel task holds the mmap_sem semaphore for a very long time during page migration due to the large number of merged pages. This blocks other virtual CPUs of the same VM, which need to access or modify the memory map.",
        "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during memory migration, when the kernel needs to unmap and re-map memory pages. The numad process initiates the migration of memory, and as part of this process, needs to flush the TLB cache of another CPU. The vulnerability is triggered because the do_migrate_pages function acquires a semaphore, holds it for too long while walking through large lists of merged pages with rmap_walk_ksm, and blocks other processes waiting for access to that semaphore.",
        "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have a virtual machine running on the same host machine where numad and KSM are enabled. They also need to be able to trigger memory migration via numad, which implies some degree of control or influence over the host's memory management. It should be noted that this is a performance/denial-of-service issue not a full compromise of the host."

          "root_cause": "The root cause lies in the maximum page sharing feature of Kernel Samepage Merging (KSM), which was introduced in Linux kernel version 4.4.0-96.119. This feature, when set to a default value (e.g., 256), allows an attacker sharing the same host as the victim to time the unmap operation to determine if their crafted page was merged with a victim's page.",

            "Timing differences in unmap operations reveal if pages are merged with victim pages."

          "impact": "An attacker can leak the victim's memory by timing the unmap operation after mapping 256 pages. The time taken for the unmap operation is different if the attacker's page has merged with a victim's page, allowing the attacker to infer if specific data resides in the victim's memory.",
         "attack_vectors":"An attacker must have a VM on the same host as a victim VM. They prepare pages of the same content, then map them 256 times as per the default setting of KSM. By observing the timing differences when unmapping these prepared pages, the attacker can determine if the pages have been merged with the victim's memory.",
