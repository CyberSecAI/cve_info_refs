sctp: fix potential deadlock on &net->sctp.addr\_wq\_lock

```
As &net->sctp.addr_wq_lock is also acquired by the timer
sctp_addr_wq_timeout_handler() in protocal.c, the same lock acquisition
at sctp_auto_asconf_init() seems should disable irq since it is called
from sctp_accept() under process context.

Possible deadlock scenario:
sctp_accept()
    -> sctp_sock_migrate()
    -> sctp_auto_asconf_init()
    -> spin_lock(&net->sctp.addr_wq_lock)
        <timer interrupt>
        -> sctp_addr_wq_timeout_handler()
        -> spin_lock_bh(&net->sctp.addr_wq_lock); (deadlock here)

This flaw was found using an experimental static analysis tool we are
developing for irq-related deadlock.

The tentative patch fix the potential deadlock by spin_lock_bh().
