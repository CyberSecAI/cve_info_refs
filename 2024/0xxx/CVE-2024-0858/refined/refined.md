**Root cause of vulnerability:**

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is a CSRF vulnerability due to the absence of proper CSRF tokens/checks when creating employees.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to make logged-in users perform unwanted actions, such as adding them as employees, without their knowledge or consent.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a malicious web page containing a form that, when submitted by a logged-in user, will trigger the vulnerable function in the plugin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in WordPress user to visit a malicious web page or click a malicious link that triggers the CSRF request. The attacker does not need prior access to the WordPress dashboard.
