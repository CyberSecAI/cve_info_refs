Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the omission of user-controlled key authorization in the IDMSistemas platform, specifically affecting the QSige product. This means the system does not properly validate or require authorization when accessing certain data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key):** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper authorization checks when accessing the API through specific endpoints.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the API by making a request to the parameter '/qsige.locator/quotePrevious/centers/X'. The information is extracted without requiring authorization.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker sends a request via HTTP to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Specific API Endpoint:** The specific vulnerable API endpoint is ` /qsige.locator/quotePrevious/centers/X`, where X is an integer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the system hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Basic HTTP Request Knowledge:** The attacker must be able to craft and send HTTP requests.
- **No prior authentication is needed** the vulnerability allows for unauthenticated access to the information.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Oscar Atienza and coordinated by INCIBE.
- The affected products are Sinergia, Sinergia 2.0, and Sinergia Corporativo.
- A patch was released on June 23, 2023, for the 'locator' module.
- The CVSS v3.1 score is 6.5 with vector `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N`
- The user interaction (UI:R) requirement in the CVSS vector implies that while no authentication is needed, a request has to be made by the attacker to trigger the vulnerability.
