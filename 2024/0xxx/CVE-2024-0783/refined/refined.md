The provided content is related to CVE-2024-0783.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) in the projectworlds' Online Admission System in PHP. The `poc.py` script shows the exploitation of this vulnerability. It leverages a file upload functionality in `documents.php` to upload a malicious PHP shell.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in `documents.php`. The application allows uploading of PHP files by manipulating the filename and content-type in the file upload request.
- Lack of input validation for the file upload functionality
- Insufficient security measures

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution on the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- Complete compromise of the affected server.
- Arbitrary code can be executed on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted POST request to `documents.php` with a malicious PHP file. The script exploits multiple file upload fields (`fpic`, `ftndoc`, `ftcdoc`, `fdmdoc`, `fdcdoc`, `fide`, `fsig`).
- The attacker must first login to the application to obtain a valid `PHPSESSID`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the online admission system.
- Network access to the vulnerable server hosting the application.
- Ability to craft and send HTTP POST requests.
