The provided content describes a file upload vulnerability in the Austin-CMS, specifically in the material upload functionality.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `getFile()` method in `com/java3y/austin/web/controller/MaterialController.java` directly writes uploaded files to the system without sanitizing or verifying the filename.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted File Upload: The system allows arbitrary file uploads without proper validation.
- Lack of Filename Sanitization: The system does not validate or sanitize the filename, allowing attackers to specify arbitrary paths.
- Remote Code Execution: By exploiting the ability to upload arbitrary files to arbitrary locations an attacker can achieve RCE.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file upload leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
- The attacker is able to upload a malicious crontab file to achieve a reverse shell.
- Full control over the target system through RCE

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker uses the file upload functionality of the CMS, accessible through the web interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the application.
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the file upload functionality.
- The attacker needs the capability to intercept and modify HTTP requests using a tool like Burp Suite.
