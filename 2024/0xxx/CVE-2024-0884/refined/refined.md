Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the construction of a SQL query using untrusted input in the `payment.php` file. Specifically, the `id` parameter from the GET request is directly used within the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the `payment.php` file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could modify the meaning of the SQL query.
- Arbitrary SQL commands could be executed by an attacker.
- Possible data exfiltration/modification and potential full database compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the HTTP GET parameter `id` in the URL, specifically `admin/operations/payment.php`.
- Example payload provided: `http://127.0.0.1/OTMSP-Final-source-code/sourcecode/tour/admin/operations/payment.php?id=1' and (updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select user()),0x7e),1));`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No special privileges or specific network position is mentioned beyond having network access to the application server.

**Additional Details:**
- The blog post demonstrates the use of `sqlmap` to identify and confirm the presence of the SQL injection vulnerability.
- The specific vulnerable line is mentioned as line 43 in `payment.php`.
- The post highlights multiple types of SQL injection detected by `sqlmap`, including boolean-based blind, error-based, stacked queries, and time-based blind SQL injections.
- The vulnerable application is identified as the "SourceCodester Online Tours & Travels Management System."
