- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The EventON and eventon-lite plugins lack authorization checks in an AJAX action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Unauthenticated users can access the `eventon_get_virtual_users` AJAX action without proper authorization. This allows them to retrieve email addresses of users on the blog.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can retrieve email addresses of all users on the affected WordPress site.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited via HTTP POST requests to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint, with the `action` parameter set to `eventon_get_virtual_users` and the `_user_role` parameter set to a specific user role (e.g., administrator, subscriber).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit the vulnerability. They can send the malicious requests remotely.
