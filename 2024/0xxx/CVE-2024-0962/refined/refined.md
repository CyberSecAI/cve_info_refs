  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of carriage return characters ('\\r') in the OSCORE configuration file parsing within the `get_split_entry` function of `src/coap_oscore.c`. Specifically, the parser doesn't correctly account for DOS-style line endings (\\r\\n) when reading comment lines or empty lines, leading to a stack buffer overflow.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow",
        "CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write"
      ],
      "impact": "The vulnerability could lead to a crash of the application and potential code execution. However, it's noted that due to the limited number of characters that can be read beyond the buffer, the risk of arbitrary code execution is low. The primary impact is a potential denial-of-service due to the crash.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability is triggered by providing a crafted OSCORE configuration file to the `coap_new_oscore_conf()` function.",
        "The attack is triggered by a malformed OSCORE configuration file using DOS line endings on a Unix based system."
      ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "A local attacker with the ability to provide a malformed OSCORE configuration file to the vulnerable application."
