{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not validate the `event_author` parameter, allowing it to be modified during event creation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Broken Access Control, Incorrect Authorization. The plugin fails to check if the user is authorized to modify the event author.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with Contributor+ access can create events and set the author to any user, including administrators. This can lead to misleading users about who created the event, potentially causing confusion or reputational damage.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the manipulation of the event creation request by changing the `event_location` parameter to `event_author` and setting an arbitrary user ID.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs a Contributor+ level account on the WordPress site. They also need to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests, typically using a proxy interceptor like Burp Suite."
