## User Review

"Some years ago somebody drew my attention to IObit Malware Fighter. First I was sceptic. But after installing it, it became my favourite anti-malware program. It is very easy to use. Through the years it already has detected several threats and removed it. In cooperation with the other IObit programs, like for example ASC, I have a good PC protection. I now recommend these programs to all my friends and family."

## User Review

"I'm using Iobit Malware Fighter PRO for quite a some time now. I must say I'm impressed with a fact, how littlere sources IMF uses during scan and in general all together. I like it's interface becouse it's simple and efficient. I own DELL PC with OEM WIN8 upgraded to WIN8.1 as soon it launches. After some time IE11 stoped working and METRO apps starts miss behave. I tryed to solve issue with Windows defender, but without success. I decided to try IMF Free and I'm glad I did. I was able to clean my system and restore all vital function without reseting it to factory level. Thank you IMF. Thumbs up, keep the good work."

## User Review

Look no further, use IObit malware fighter v6 and enjoy safe surfing! I have used IObits products for a long time and they have kept my PC running smoothly, updated and safe for years to my full satisfaction. IObit's intuitive and smart user interface design is simple to use and does the job with a minimal time spent - great! Recently I downloaded a YTD video downloader from Cnet and got a lot of malicious malware as a “bonus gift”! All my browsers went out of order as a result of the installation. My Norton failed to catch it, but IObits malware fighter 6 Free did the job and restored order on my PC!
