Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-0664

**Root Cause:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the Meks Smart Social Widget plugin for WordPress. Specifically, the `content` field of the widget was not properly sanitized before being output on the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into the widget's `content` field. These scripts are then stored in the database and executed whenever a user views a page containing the widget.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Arbitrary web scripts can be injected and executed in the context of a victim's browser.
- Attackers can potentially perform malicious actions, such as:
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Stealing cookies and session data
    - Defacing the website
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user
    - Any other action achievable through JavaScript execution

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Meks Smart Social Widget settings page in the WordPress admin panel.
- An attacker with administrator-level privileges can inject malicious code into the widget's `content` field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated administrator-level access to the WordPress dashboard.
- The vulnerability is only exploitable on multi-site installations, or installations where `unfiltered_html` has been disabled.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.6.4 of the plugin by using `wp_kses_post` to sanitize the content field before output.
- The provided content offers more details than a typical CVE description, specifying the vulnerable code location, the fix, and limitations for exploitation.
