Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the identified SQL injection vulnerability:

* **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the usage of `${}` for string concatenation within the SQL query construction in the `BookSettingServiceImpl#list` method when processing parameters passed to the `/novel/bookSetting/list` endpoint. Specifically, the `sort` and `order` parameters are directly inserted into the SQL query without proper sanitization.

* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection (SQLi). The lack of proper input validation and sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query.

* **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability could lead to:
    * Data exfiltration: Access to sensitive data stored in the database.
    * Data manipulation: Modification or deletion of data.
    * Potential compromise of the database server.

* **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request to the `/novel/bookSetting/list` endpoint, by manipulating the `sort` and/or `order` parameters.

* **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `/novel/bookSetting/list` endpoint. No specific authentication is mentioned to be needed for the request.

**Additional Information:**

*   The affected component is `/novel/bookSetting/list`.
*   The vulnerable code is found in `com.java2nb.novel.controller.BookSettingController#list` which takes the request, and `com.java2nb.novel.service.impl.BookSettingServiceImpl#list` which builds the vulnerable query.
*   The specific payload used in the example is `AND 2111=(SELECT(CASE WHEN(2111=2111) THEN 2111 ELSE(SELECT 3865 UNION SELECT 6957) END))-- -`, demonstrating the ability to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   The vulnerability is present in novel-plus version 4.3.0-RC1.
