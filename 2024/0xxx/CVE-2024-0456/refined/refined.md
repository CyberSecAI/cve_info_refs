Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-0456:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an authorization flaw in how GitLab handles Merge Request (MR) assignee updates. Specifically, a non-member of a project can use the API to assign arbitrary users to a merge request they created within that project, even though they lack the necessary permissions to do so through the UI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Authorization Checks:** The `MergeRequests::UpdateAssigneesService` incorrectly checks for `:update_merge_request` permission instead of a more restrictive permission like `:set_merge_request_metadata`. This allows unauthorized users (MR authors without project membership) to modify MR assignees.
- **API Bypass:** While the UI correctly restricts assignee modifications for non-members, the API allows bypassing these restrictions through a direct PUT request using `assignee_ids[]` parameter.
- **Inconsistency:**  The inconsistent behavior between the UI and the API leads to unexpected privilege escalation by API manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker (a user who created an MR without project membership) can assign any user to their created MR.
- This could potentially be used for various malicious activities including misdirection, misleading project members, and impacting team workflows by assigning wrong users, etc.
- While the vulnerability allows modification of assignees, other parameters like `labels` cannot be modified using the same technique.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct API manipulation:**  The attacker needs to send a `PUT` request to the GitLab API, specifically to the `/api/v4/projects/<UPSTREAM-PROJECT-ID>/merge_requests/<MR-ID>` endpoint using the `assignee_ids[]` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **GitLab Account:** The attacker must have a GitLab account to create an MR.
- **Non-member of Target Project:** The attacker must not be a member of the project to which the MR is being submitted to.
- **Knowledge of API Endpoint:** The attacker must be aware of the GitLab API endpoint and the specific parameters to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Project/MR Identification:** The attacker needs to know the upstream project ID and the ID of their created Merge Request.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable using the REST API, specifically with the `assignee_ids` or `assignee_id` parameter.
- The vulnerability is not exploitable if other parameters, such as `labels` are included in the request.
- A similar issue was identified with the `MergeRequests::UpdateReviewersService` when the GraphQL mutation is used.

This vulnerability has been assigned **CVE-2024-0456**.
