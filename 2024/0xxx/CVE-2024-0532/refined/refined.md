- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `set_repeat24` function due to the use of `strcpy` without any length checks when copying the `wpapsk_crypto` parameter.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow due to the use of `strcpy` with an attacker-controlled input without any length validation.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can perform Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE) by overflowing the buffer with a carefully crafted payload.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/WifiExtraSet` endpoint, specifically by manipulating the `wpapsk_crypto2_4g` parameter.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device (Tenda A15 router) and must know the correct API endpoint and parameters to trigger the vulnerability.
