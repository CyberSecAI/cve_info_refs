Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- An out-of-bounds read occurs in the `vp8dsp_altivec.c` file of the FFmpeg library. Specifically, the issue lies in the `h_subpel_filters_outer` array, which is used for 6-tap horizontal subpixel filtering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `h_subpel_filters_outer` array was defined with only 3 elements, while the code accessing it via `(i)>>1` could access index 3. This results in an out-of-bounds read when the index `i` in `h_subpel_filters_inner[i]` is 6, since `h_subpel_filters_outer[(i)>>1]` then uses index `6>>1 = 3`, which is out of the allocated bounds of size 3.
- This out-of-bounds read can lead to unpredictable behavior, potentially including crashes or other security issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can cause an out-of-bounds read. Although the provided content doesn't explicitly state the full impact, out-of-bounds reads are a common cause of crashes, and in certain cases can be leveraged for information disclosure or other more serious exploits.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when decoding VP8 video content. Specifically, it is triggered when performing 6-tap horizontal subpixel filtering in the `put_vp8_epel_h_altivec_core` function and a specific filter index (6) is used.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to provide a crafted VP8 video stream that causes the code to access the `h_subpel_filters_outer` array out of bounds.
- The attacker would need to control the parameters of the video stream that influence the subpixel filtering to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information also includes a link to a commit that addresses this vulnerability by increasing the size of the  `h_subpel_filters_outer` array to 4 and adding a value for the new entry.
- The vulnerability was identified due to FATE-failures with UBSan.
- The vulnerability affects FFmpeg version n6.1.1.
