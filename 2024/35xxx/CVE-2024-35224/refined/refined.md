Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-35224

**Root Cause:** Improper sanitization of user input within the OpenProject Cost Report functionality. Specifically, the header values of the report table are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** Malicious JavaScript code can be injected and stored within the application's database, and executed when a user views the cost report.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided data before including it in the cost report table headers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A Project Admin could potentially escalate their privileges by targeting a System Admin with the XSS attack. The attacker could potentially execute malicious code within the session of the targeted user and modify data, access sensitive information, or perform actions with the permissions of the targeted user.
*   **Bypass CSP (Content Security Policy):** By storing the malicious JavaScript in the ticket's attachment, an attacker can bypass the application's Content Security Policy.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **User-Provided Data:** The attacker injects the malicious payload through a custom field, which is then used to generate a report table header.
*  **Attachment:** Utilizing a ticket's attachment is also part of the attack vector, allowing the attacker to store javascript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Permissions:** The attacker requires the "Edit work packages" and "Add attachments" permissions to execute this attack.
*   **Knowledge of Cost Report Feature:** The attacker needs to know how to configure custom fields, insert them into a ticket, and then run a cost report.
*  **Project Admin Role** The attacker needs to be a project admin or have the permissions equivalent to a project admin.

**Affected Versions:**
*   Versions prior to 14.1.0
*   Versions prior to 14.0.2
*   Versions prior to 13.4.2

**Patched Versions:**
*   14.1.0
*  14.0.2
*   13.4.2

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability has a high severity rating with a CVSS score of 7.6.
*   The attack complexity is low.
*   User interaction is required to trigger the exploit (the victim must view the maliciously crafted cost report).
*   The scope of the vulnerability is changed because it impacts resources beyond the component's original security scope.
*   There is high potential for data confidentiality loss and low potential for data integrity loss, and no loss of availability.
