Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-35160:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Insufficient session expiration when handling authorizations in IBM Watson Query (Data Virtualization) and IBM Db2 Big SQL on Cloud Pak for Data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient session expiration: The software does not properly invalidate or expire user sessions after a period of inactivity or after the user logs out.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially maintain access to the system even after a legitimate user has logged out, due to the session not expiring. This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through network access to the application where the vulnerable service is running.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to have gained valid credentials and authenticated to the vulnerable services initially to establish a session.
- An attacker would then need to exploit the insufficient session expiration to maintain access.
