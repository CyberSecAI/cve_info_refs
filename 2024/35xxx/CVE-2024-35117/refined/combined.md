# Security Bulletin: IBM OpenPages may write sensitive information with System tracing enabled (CVE-2024-35117)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

IBM OpenPages may write sensitive data to server log files when the 'UI API' tracing is enabled per the System Tracing feature.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2024-35117](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/290340)

## Affected Products and Versions

| Affected Product(s) | Version(s) |
| --- | --- |
| IBM OpenPages | 9.0 |

## Remediation/Fixes

In IBM OpenPages 9.0, enabling additional user interface tracing could potentially write sensitive data to debug log files when an administrator performs a password reset on a user whose passwords are managed by OpenPages native authentication. Fixes and installation instructions are provided at the URLs listed below:

| **Product** | **Remediation** |
| --- | --- |
| For IBM OpenPages with Watson **9.0**  - Apply 9.0 FixPack 2 **(9.0.0.2)** then,  - Apply 9.0.0.2 Interim Fix 2 (9.0**.0.2.2**) or later    Or    - Apply 9.0 FixPack 3 **(9.0.0.3)** | **Download URL for 9.0.0.2**  <https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-openpages-90-fix-pack-2>  **Download URL for 9.0.0.2.2**  <https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-openpages-9002-interim-fix-2>    **Download URL for 9.0.0.3**  <https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-openpages-90-fix-pack-3> |

For IBM OpenPages v8.0/8.1/8.2 customers, IBM recommends to upgrade to a fixed and supported **versions 8.3** or **9.0** of the product.

## Workarounds and Mitigations

Disable UI API tracing in the System Tracing administration menu. See 'Enabling Trace Logging' topic in IBM OpenPages product documentation <https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/openpages/9.0.0?topic=files-enabling-trace-logging>

Environments where user passwords are not managed in OpenPages by an administrator, such as when Single Sign-On or LDAP authentication are used, are not affected.

## Disclaimer

According to the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an "industry open standard designed to convey vulnerability severity and help to determine urgency and priority of response." IBM PROVIDES THE CVSS SCORES ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. CUSTOMERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF ANY ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY. In addition to other efforts to address potential vulnerabilities, IBM periodically updates the record of components contained in our product offerings. As part of that effort, if IBM identifies previously unidentified packages in a product/service inventory, we address relevant vulnerabilities regardless of CVE date. Inclusion of an older CVEID does not demonstrate that the referenced product has been used by IBM since that date, nor that IBM was aware of a vulnerability as of that date. We are making clients aware of relevant vulnerabilities as we become aware of them. "Affected Products and Versions" referenced in IBM Security Bulletins are intended to be only products and versions that are supported by IBM and have not passed their end-of-support or warranty date. Thus, failure to reference unsupported or extended-support products and versions in this Security Bulletin does not constitute a determination by IBM that they are unaffected by the vulnerability. Reference to one or more unsupported versions in this Security Bulletin shall not create an obligation for IBM to provide fixes for any unsupported or extended-support products or versions.
