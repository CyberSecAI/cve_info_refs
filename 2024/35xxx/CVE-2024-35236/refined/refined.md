Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-35236:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `epub.js` library configuration, specifically the `allowScriptedContent` option being set to `true` by default in Audiobookshelf's EpubReader component. This allows arbitrary JavaScript code embedded within EPUB files to execute within the browsing context. The iframe used by `epub.js` sets the `sandbox` attribute but includes `allow-same-origin`, which combined with `allow-scripts` makes the sandbox ineffective.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Maliciously crafted EPUB files can execute arbitrary JavaScript code due to the `allowScriptedContent` setting and the ineffective iframe sandbox.
*   **Insecure Default Configuration:** The `allowScriptedContent` option was enabled by default, exposing users to the risk of XSS attacks when opening untrusted EPUB files.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:**  The application doesn't sanitize or restrict the content within EPUB files, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
*   **File Upload and Library Creation Power:**  The free-form nature of file uploads and library creation allowed the attacker to upload a malicious executable by abusing the podcast library and its file structure.
*   **Insufficient Sandboxing:** The usage of iframes with `allow-same-origin` and `allow-scripts` made the sandboxing obsolete.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact of this vulnerability ranges from:
* **Stealing session tokens:** Malicious scripts can access the user's `localStorage`, potentially compromising their session.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By exploiting the file upload and library creation features, a high-privileged user can overwrite the `FFmpeg` executable with a malicious one, leading to RCE on the server (specifically on Windows, or potentially on Linux by overwriting authorized_keys).
*   **Arbitrary File Write:**  The vulnerability allows for arbitrary file writes, which can be used to achieve RCE.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious EPUB Files:** The primary attack vector involves distributing malicious EPUB files through pirate sites or compromised online conversion services.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires a user to open a malicious EPUB file within the Audiobookshelf application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create malicious EPUB files:** The attacker needs to create an EPUB file containing malicious JavaScript code.
*   **User with high privileges (upload, creation of libraries):**  RCE requires a user with privileges to upload and create libraries, especially podcast libraries. The vulnerability itself can be triggered by any user viewing a malicious ebook.
*  **Knowledge of file paths:** Specifically for RCE, attacker needs to know the path of the ffmpeg binary, which may be obtained by directory listing APIs.

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability was fixed by:
*   **Disabling Scripted Content by Default:** The `allowScriptedContent` option in `EpubReader.vue` is now disabled by default and can be enabled via a library setting.
*   **Library setting to enable scripted content:** A new library setting was introduced in the UI to enable scripted content within EPUB files (this setting is disabled by default).
*   **Security update:** Scripted content in epub ereader is disabled by default.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was tested on version 2.9.0 on Windows.
*  The attacker does not have to prepare the ebook specifically for audiobookshelf, but some fingerprinting could be used to determine in which environment it's running.
* The severity was rated as "Moderate" by the reporter.
* The fix implemented in commit `ce7f891b9b2cb57c6644aaf96f89a8bda6307664` addresses the issue.
