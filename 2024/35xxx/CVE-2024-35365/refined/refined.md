Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-35365:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

   - The provided content, especially the commit message and the gist, explicitly mentions "CVE-2024-35365" and describes a double-free vulnerability in `fftools/ffmpeg_mux_init.c` within the `new_stream_audio` function of FFmpeg. Therefore, the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**

   - The vulnerability stems from the premature setting of `ost->apad` using `MATCH_PER_STREAM_OPT` within the `new_stream_audio` function in `fftools/ffmpeg_mux_init.c`.
   - The code originally directly set `ost->apad` and then duplicated it using `av_strdup` to take ownership. However, if an error occurred later in the function (e.g., during option parsing), the originally allocated memory pointed to by `ost->apad` would not be freed, and the duplicated string would be freed, leading to a double free.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

   - **Double Free:** The core weakness is a double-free vulnerability.  The code first sets `ost->apad` based on an input option. Then, it duplicates this via `av_strdup` to take ownership of the pointer. However, if errors occur later in the `new_stream_audio` function, the originally set `ost->apad` remains allocated. Upon cleanup, the duplicate is freed and the original `ost->apad` is also freed, leading to a double free.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

   - The primary impact is a crash due to the double free. This could lead to denial of service or potentially other undefined behavior, depending on how the memory is managed by the system.

**5. Attack vectors:**

   - The attack vector involves providing specific input options to `ffmpeg` that trigger the vulnerable code path in `new_stream_audio`. The provided commit message includes a command that reproduces the issue: `ffmpeg -filter_complex anullsrc  -apad bar -apad:n baz -f null -`
   - By manipulating input options like `-apad`, an attacker can trigger the double free condition.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

   - An attacker needs the ability to execute the `ffmpeg` binary with crafted command-line arguments. They do not need special privileges, as the vulnerability lies within the application's logic.

**Additional Details:**

   - The provided content from the commit message explains that this is a regression introduced since commit `83ace80bfd80fcdba2c65fa1d554923ea931d5bd`.
   - The fix implemented in commit `ced5c5fdb8634d39ca9472a2026b2d2fea16c4e5` involves:
        - Using a temporary variable `apad` to store the option value.
        - Only duplicating the string with `av_strdup` if the string is not null. This prevents the premature allocation and the double-free.
   - The vulnerable code is located in `fftools/ffmpeg_mux_init.c`, specifically the `new_stream_audio` function between line 855 and 857.

In summary, CVE-2024-35365 is a double-free vulnerability in FFmpeg that can be triggered by providing specific command-line arguments to the `ffmpeg` tool that lead to a double free in the `new_stream_audio` function, causing a crash. The patch addresses this issue by preventing the premature allocation of memory and subsequent double free.
