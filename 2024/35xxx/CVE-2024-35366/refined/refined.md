Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-35366:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation when parsing the `-L` option in the `parse_options` function within `sbgdec.c`. This allows a negative value to be assigned to `p->scs.opt_duration` without adequate checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow:  The core weakness is that a negative duration value isn't prevented. This can lead to an integer overflow when `opt_duration` is used later in calculations, because `opt_duration` is a signed 64-bit integer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Integer overflows can lead to various issues, including incorrect calculations, unexpected behavior, and potentially more serious security flaws.  In this specific case, a negative duration value might lead to out-of-bounds access, crashes, or other unexpected behavior in the program when the duration is used.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a specially crafted SBG file that includes the `-L` option with a negative duration value. The vulnerable `sbgdec.c` will parse the file and be affected.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted SBG file to be parsed by the vulnerable FFmpeg library. This could be through a user opening a malicious file, or when the FFmpeg library is used to decode media from a potentially untrusted source.

**Additional details:**
- The provided commit `0bed22d597b78999151e3bde0768b7fe763fc2a6` fixes the issue by adding a check to ensure `p->scs.opt_duration` is not negative.
- The vulnerability was found by a continuous fuzzing process and was assigned the id `62276/clusterfuzz-testcase-minimized-ffmpeg_dem_SBG_fuzzer-5133181743136768`.
