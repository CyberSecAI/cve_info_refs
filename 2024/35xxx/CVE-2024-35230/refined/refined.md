The provided content relates to CVE-2024-35230.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The welcome and about pages of GeoServer display version and revision information, including details about the software and libraries used. This information disclosure can be used by attackers to identify vulnerable software components and plan targeted attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Disclosure: The software exposes sensitive version information in its welcome page footer and about page, which can be accessed by unauthenticated users. This violates the principle of least privilege and makes it easier to identify potentially vulnerable software.
- Lack of Access Control: The version and build information is visible to all users, regardless of their authentication status or privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can identify the exact version of GeoServer and its components running on the server.
- This allows attackers to target known vulnerabilities specific to the identified versions.
- This makes it easier for attackers to plan and execute more effective attacks by exploiting known weaknesses in the components.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network Access: An attacker can access the vulnerable information through HTTP requests.
- Specifically, the welcome page footer and the about page (accessible to anyone) expose the information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No special privileges or authentication is required.
- Attacker needs network access to the GeoServer instance
