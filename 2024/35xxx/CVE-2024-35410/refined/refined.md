The provided content relates to CVE-2024-35410.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a heap overflow in the `interpret` function of the `wac` project, specifically within the `wa.c` file. This occurs when processing a crafted WebAssembly (wasm) file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Multiple heap buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the `interpret` function at different locations in the code (lines 993, 860, 1380, 706, 925, 832, 1168 and 947 of wa.c). These are triggered when parsing specifically crafted wasm files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to a denial of service (DoS). The vulnerability can also lead to code execution, though that's not explicitly detailed.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a crafted wasm file. The vulnerability is triggered when the `wace` executable is used to process the malicious wasm file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted wasm file to the vulnerable `wac` application for processing. This implies a remote attack vector. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable code is found in the `wac` project, specifically commit `385e13ca840100f70d05781f45209da82fb6c45c`.
- The vulnerability is located in the `interpret` function of `wa.c`.
- The issue was discovered by Ziyi Guo, and reported by haruki3hhh on GitHub.
- The ASAN reports provide specific locations and details of the overflows, including the addresses, read/write sizes, and call stacks.
- PoC files to trigger the vulnerability are also provided through links.
