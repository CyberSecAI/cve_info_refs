{
  "CVE-2024-4109": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the improper reuse of an HTTP request header value from a previous stream for a subsequent stream on the same HTTP/2 connection. Specifically, the `readHpackString` method in Undertow's `io.undertow.protocols.http2.HpackDecoder` class incorrectly reuses a `StringBuilder` field across multiple requests.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper reuse of a `StringBuilder` field in the `readHpackString` method",
      "HTTP/2 header processing flaw"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to information leakage between requests on the same HTTP/2 connection.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through sending malicious or crafted HTTP/2 requests that can cause the server to reuse headers inappropriately.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to send HTTP/2 requests to the server."
  },
  "CVE-2024-51127": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `createTempFile` method of HornetQ, which allows for arbitrary file overwriting or access to sensitive information.",
     "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure usage of `createTempFile` method",
        "Insufficient validation of file paths"
      ],
    "impact": "An attacker can arbitrarily overwrite files or access sensitive information by exploiting the `createTempFile` method.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves manipulating inputs to the HornetQ server, leading to the creation of temporary files in a way that allows file overwrite or information access.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to send malicious requests to the HornetQ server."
