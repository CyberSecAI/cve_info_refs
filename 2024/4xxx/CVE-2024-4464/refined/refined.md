- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Authorization bypass through a user-controlled key vulnerability in the streaming service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation or sanitization of user-controlled keys used in the streaming service, leading to an authorization bypass.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can read specific files.
- **Attack vectors:** Unspecified vectors, but the attack can be performed remotely over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any special privileges or user interaction to perform the attack. It can be performed remotely over the network by any user.
