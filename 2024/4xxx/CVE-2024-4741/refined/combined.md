## Description

Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL\_free\_buffers may cause

memory to be accessed that was previously freed in some situations

Impact summary: A use after free can have a range of potential consequences such

as the corruption of valid data, crashes or execution of arbitrary code.

However, only applications that directly call the SSL\_free\_buffers function are

affected by this issue. Applications that do not call this function are not

vulnerable. Our investigations indicate that this function is rarely used by

applications.

The SSL\_free\_buffers function is used to free the internal OpenSSL buffer used

when processing an incoming record from the network. The call is only expected

to succeed if the buffer is not currently in use. However, two scenarios have

been identified where the buffer is freed even when still in use.

The first scenario occurs where a record header has been received from the

network and processed by OpenSSL, but the full record body has not yet arrived.

In this case calling SSL\_free\_buffers will succeed even though a record has only

been partially processed and the buffer is still in use.

The second scenario occurs where a full record containing application data has

been received and processed by OpenSSL but the application has only read part of

this data. Again a call to SSL\_free\_buffers will succeed even though the buffer

is still in use.

While these scenarios could occur accidentally during normal operation a

malicious attacker could attempt to engineer a stituation where this occurs.

We are not aware of this issue being actively exploited.

The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

OpenSSL Security Advisory [28th May 2024]
=========================================
Use After Free with SSL\_free\_buffers (CVE-2024-4741)
====================================================
Severity: Low
Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL\_free\_buffers may cause
memory to be accessed that was previously freed in some situations
Impact summary: A use after free can have a range of potential consequences such
as the corruption of valid data, crashes or execution of arbitrary code.
However, only applications that directly call the SSL\_free\_buffers function are
affected by this issue. Applications that do not call this function are not

While these scenarios could occur accidentally during normal operation a
malicious attacker could attempt to engineer a stituation where this occurs.
We are not aware of this issue being actively exploited.
The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 is also not affected by this issue.
OpenSSL 3.3, 3.2, 3.1, 3.0 and 1.1.1 are vulnerable to this issue.
OpenSSL 3.3 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.3.1 once it is released.
OpenSSL 3.2 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.2.2 once it is released.
OpenSSL 3.1 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.1.6 once it is released.
OpenSSL 3.0 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.0.14 once it is released.
OpenSSL 1.1.1 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1y once it is released
(premium support customers only).
Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of
OpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they
become available. The fix is also available in commit e5093133c3 (for 3.3),
commit c88c3de510 (for 3.2), commit 704f725b96 (for 3.1) and commit b3f0eb0a29
(for 3.0) in the OpenSSL git repository. It is available to premium support
customers in commit f7a045f314 (for 1.1.1).
This issue was reported on 10th April 2024 by William Ahern (Akamai). The fix
was developed by Matt Caswell and Watson Ladd (Akamai).

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Only free the read buffers if we're not using them

```
If we're part way through processing a record, or the application has
not released all the records then we should not free our buffer because
they are still needed.
