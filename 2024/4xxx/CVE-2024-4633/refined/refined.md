Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-4633:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the `addExtraMimeType` function of the Slider & Popup Builder by Depicter plugin. This function allows users to add custom mime types, including SVG and JSON.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The lack of proper sanitization allows malicious code to be injected through custom mime types.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts that will execute in the browsers of other users who access the affected pages where the injected code is present. This could lead to various malicious activities like session hijacking, phishing, defacement, and other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious code into the mime types via the `addExtraMimeType` function.
- This requires an attacker to have author-level permissions or higher within the WordPress application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:**  The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with at least author-level privileges.
- **Access to Plugin settings:** The attacker needs to be able to access the plugin settings where the `addExtraMimeType` function can be used to inject the malicious code.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in versions of the Slider & Popup Builder by Depicter plugin up to and including version 3.2.1.
- The vulnerability has been fixed in version 3.2.2 of the plugin.
- The vulnerable code is present in the `SVGServiceProvider.php` file, specifically in the `addExtraMimeType` function.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability in the Slider & Popup Builder by Depicter plugin allows authenticated users with author-level permissions or higher to inject stored XSS payloads by adding custom mime types without sanitizing input, leading to a medium severity security issue.
