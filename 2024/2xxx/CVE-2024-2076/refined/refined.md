Based on the provided document, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper access control implementation in the House Rental Management System. Specifically, backend pages like `booking.php`, `owner.php`, and `tenant.php` can be accessed without prior user authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** The system allows access to backend pages without requiring users to log in.
- **Missing Authentication:** The vulnerability stems from the absence of authentication checks on the mentioned pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Leakage:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive data stored or managed by these backend pages, like booking details, owner information and tenant data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct URL Access:** Attackers can directly access the vulnerable pages by typing the URLs (`booking.php`, `owner.php`, `tenant.php`) in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers need network connectivity to the server hosting the application.
- **Basic Knowledge:** Attackers only need to know (or guess) the URLs to the vulnerable pages. No advanced technical skills or system level access is necessary.
