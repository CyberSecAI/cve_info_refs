Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:**  CVE-2024-2021 (Note: The CVE description is a placeholder, but the provided content relates to the described vulnerability)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the `list_localuser.php` file of the Netcom NS-ASG application security gateway. The application directly uses user-supplied input within an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application takes the `UserId[]` array from the GET request and directly incorporates its values into an SQL query within the `delete` action. This lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code. Specifically, the code iterates through `$ResId` (which seems to be derived from `UserId[]`) and appends each value to the `$sourdeststr` variable, used to construct an SQL query without any input validation or escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Exposure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, as demonstrated by the POC which retrieves the database name.
*   **Data Manipulation:**  Beyond reading data, an attacker could potentially modify or delete database records, which may have severe implications on the application's functionality and data integrity.
*   **Server Compromise:** Depending on the database system and the application's permissions, successful exploitation could lead to more severe consequences, such as server compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `/admin/list_localuser.php` endpoint.
*   **`UserId[]` Parameter:** The `UserId[]` parameter in the GET request is the primary injection point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server hosting the Netcom NS-ASG application security gateway.
*   **Authentication (Likely):** Although not explicitly stated in the POC, the presence of the `PHPSESSID` cookie implies that authentication to the admin panel is likely required before the vulnerable endpoint can be accessed.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable File:** `/admin/list_localuser.php`
*   **Vulnerable Action:** `delete`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `UserId[]`
*   **Affected Version:** 6.3
*   **Vendor:** Beijing Wangkang Technology Co., Ltd. (Netentsec)

**POC:**

The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates the vulnerability:

```
GET /admin/list_localuser.php?action=delete&UserId[]=111*&&UserId[]=222 HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1
Cookie: PHPSESSID=8f6eb605230a5ac1e25d4bc6478a140d

This POC injects SQL syntax ("*") within the `UserId` parameter to test for the SQL injection and reveals that the database name is exposed in the error output.
