            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2024-2201 / XSA-456
                              version 2

                 x86: Native Branch History Injection

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

In August 2022, researchers at VU Amsterdam disclosed Spectre-BHB.

Spectre-BHB was discussed in XSA-398.  At the time, the susceptibility
of Xen to Spectre-BHB was uncertain so no specific action was taken in
XSA-398.  However, various changes were made thereafter in upstream Xen
as a consequence; more on these later.

VU Amsterdam have subsequently adjusted the attack to be pulled off
entirely from userspace, without the aid of a managed runtime in the
victim context.

For more details, see:
  <https://vusec.net/projects/native-bhi>
  <https://vusec.net/projects/bhi-spectre-bhb>
  <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/technical-documentation/branch-history-injection.html>
  <https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-398.html>

IMPACT
======

An attacker might be able to infer the contents of arbitrary host
memory, including memory assigned to other guests.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Systems running all versions of Xen are affected.

Only Intel x86 CPUs are potentially affected.  CPUs from other
manufacturers are not known to be affected.

A wide range of Intel CPUs employ Branch History prediction techniques.
However for older CPUs existing Spectre-v2 mitigations (XSA-254) are
believed to be sufficient to mitigate Native-BHI.

Therefore, the rest of the discussion will be limited in scope to the
CPUs for which a change in behaviour is expected.  These are believed to
be all CPUs with eIBRS (Enhanced IBRS, a.k.a. IBRS_ALL or IBRS_ATT).
eIBRS signifies a hardware adjustment (mode-tagged indirect predictions)
designed to combat Spectre-v2, available in CPUs from 2019 onwards.

To determine if a system has eIBRS, run `xen-cpuid -v` in dom0, looking for
the string "eibrs" in the Dynamic Raw block of information.  e.g.

  # xen-cpuid -v
  ...
  Dynamic sets:
  Raw                             ...
    ...
    [16] MSR_ARCH_CAPS.lo         ... eibrs ...
    ...
  ...

Be aware that the Static sets are compile time information so will include the
string "eibrs" irrespective of hardware support.  If there is no row for "[16]
MSR_ARCH_CAPS.lo" then the fixes for XSA-435 are missing.

MITIGATION
==========

There are no mitigations.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by VU Amsterdam.

RESOLUTION
==========

In Xen 4.17, in response to the original Spectre-BHB, CET-IBT support was
added to Xen to use on capable hardware.  It also came with work to remove
unnecessary function pointers, and to de-virtualise function pointers at boot,
as both a performance and hardening improvement.  This work has been steadily
continuing since, and every removed/de-virtualised function pointer reduces
the options available to an adversary trying to mount a Native-BHI attack.
All of this work has been backported to 4.17 and later for this advisory.

Beginning with the Intel Alder Lake (Client) and Sapphire Rapids (Server)
CPUs, a hardware control called BHI_DIS_S is available, which restricts
history-based predictions.  This control requires updated microcode on some
CPUs.  Look for "bhi-ctrl" in `xen-cpuid -v`, similar to eibrs above.

Xen has been updated to use this control when available, and to virtualise it
for guests to use.

For CPUs without BHI_DIS_S, BHB clearing sequences need using.  Out of an
abundance of caution, all sequences in the Intel whitepaper have been
implemented, although Xen will only use the "short" sequence by default.  The
others are available to opt in to.

The work to mitigate Native-BHI is extensive, and the backports are
more-extensive still.

Therefore, we have decided to produce new releases on all stable trees.
Please find fixes in the respective branches under the following release
tags:

  RELEASE-4.18.2
  RELEASE-4.17.4
  RELEASE-4.16.6
  RELEASE-4.15.6

Other release activities (tarballs, announcements, etc) will happen in
due course.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:

Issues were in those found subsequently.  To address those, newer commits
from the stable branches need updating to, in particular

stable-4.15	056500003eb44314cb90f2e3e7b2d405e86b5657

stable-4.18	f0ff1d9cb96041a84a24857a6464628240deed4f

For 4.15, since we're closing the branch, RELEASE-4.15.7 was tagged in
addition; other release activities - as per above - will follow.

## Linux kernel on Intel systems is susceptible to Spectre v2 attacks

#### Vulnerability Note VU#155143

Original Release Date: 2024-04-09 | Last Revised: 2024-12-19

---

### Overview

A new cross-privilege Spectre v2 vulnerability that impacts modern CPU architectures supporting speculative execution has been discovered. CPU hardware utilizing speculative execution that are vulnerable to Spectre v2 branch history injection (BHI) are likely affected. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to leak privileged memory from the CPU by speculatively jumping to a chosen gadget. Current research shows that existing mitigation techniques of disabling privileged eBPF and enabling (Fine)IBT are insufficient in stopping BHI exploitation against the kernel/hypervisor.

### Description

Speculative execution is an optimization technique in which a computer system performs some task preemptively to improve performance and provide additional concurrency as and when extra resources are available. However, these speculative executions leave traces of memory accesses or computations in the CPUâs cache, buffer, and branch predictors. Attackers can take advantage of these and, in some cases, also influence speculative execution paths via malicious software to infer privileged data that is part of a distinct execution. See article [Spectre Side Channels](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/hw-vuln/spectre.html) for more information. Attackers exploiting Spectre v2 take advantage of the speculative execution of indirect branch predictors, which are steered to gadget code by poisoning the branch target buffer of a CPU used for predicting indirect branch addresses, leaking arbitrary kernel memory and bypassing all currently deployed mitigations.

Current mitigations rely on the unavailability of exploitable gadgets to eliminate the attack surface. However, researchers demonstrated that with the use of their gadget analysis tool, InSpectre Gadget, they can uncover new, exploitable gadgets in the Linux kernel and that those are sufficient at bypassing deployed Intel mitigations.

### Impact

An attacker with access to CPU resources may be able to read arbitrary privileged data or system registry values by speculatively jumping to a chosen gadget.

### Solution

Please update your software according to the recommendations from respective vendors with the latest mitigations available to address this vulnerability and its variants.

### Acknowledgements

Thanks to Sander Wiebing, Alvise de Faveri Tron, Herbert Bos, and Cristiano Giuffrida from the VUSec group at VU Amsterdam for discovering and reporting this vulnerability, as well as supporting coordinated disclosure. This document was written by Dr. Elke Drennan, CISSP.

#### Vendor Statement

We'd like to thank the researchers for their work. It helps improve our understanding of these types of vulnerabilities. Our engineering teams conducted a thorough review and determined that Apple silicon based systems are not vulnerable to this type of attack. While Intel based Macs may be susceptible in theory, we are not aware of any proof-of-concept that demonstrates actual exploitability on the platform. We will continue to monitor research in this area, and will work to protect our customers if anything changes.

                 x86: Native Branch History Injection

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Issues were found with the original code changes.  See the bottom of the
Resolution section for how to obtain those.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

In August 2022, researchers at VU Amsterdam disclosed Spectre-BHB.

Spectre-BHB was discussed in XSA-398.  At the time, the susceptibility
of Xen to Spectre-BHB was uncertain so no specific action was taken in
XSA-398.  However, various changes were made thereafter in upstream Xen
as a consequence; more on these later.

VU Amsterdam have subsequently adjusted the attack to be pulled off
entirely from userspace, without the aid of a managed runtime in the
victim context.

For more details, see:
  <https://vusec.net/projects/native-bhi>
  <https://vusec.net/projects/bhi-spectre-bhb>
  <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/technical-documentation/branch-history-injection.html>
  <https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-398.html>

IMPACT
======

An attacker might be able to infer the contents of arbitrary host
memory, including memory assigned to other guests.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Systems running all versions of Xen are affected.

Only Intel x86 CPUs are potentially affected.  CPUs from other
manufacturers are not known to be affected.

A wide range of Intel CPUs employ Branch History prediction techniques.
However for older CPUs existing Spectre-v2 mitigations (XSA-254) are
believed to be sufficient to mitigate Native-BHI.

Therefore, the rest of the discussion will be limited in scope to the
CPUs for which a change in behaviour is expected.  These are believed to
be all CPUs with eIBRS (Enhanced IBRS, a.k.a. IBRS_ALL or IBRS_ATT).
eIBRS signifies a hardware adjustment (mode-tagged indirect predictions)
designed to combat Spectre-v2, available in CPUs from 2019 onwards.

To determine if a system has eIBRS, run `xen-cpuid -v` in dom0, looking for
the string "eibrs" in the Dynamic Raw block of information.  e.g.

  # xen-cpuid -v
  ...
  Dynamic sets:
  Raw                             ...
    ...
    [16] MSR_ARCH_CAPS.lo         ... eibrs ...
    ...
  ...

Be aware that the Static sets are compile time information so will include the
string "eibrs" irrespective of hardware support.  If there is no row for "[16]
MSR_ARCH_CAPS.lo" then the fixes for XSA-435 are missing.

MITIGATION
==========

There are no mitigations.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by VU Amsterdam.

RESOLUTION
==========

In Xen 4.17, in response to the original Spectre-BHB, CET-IBT support was
added to Xen to use on capable hardware.  It also came with work to remove
unnecessary function pointers, and to de-virtualise function pointers at boot,
as both a performance and hardening improvement.  This work has been steadily
continuing since, and every removed/de-virtualised function pointer reduces
the options available to an adversary trying to mount a Native-BHI attack.
All of this work has been backported to 4.17 and later for this advisory.

Beginning with the Intel Alder Lake (Client) and Sapphire Rapids (Server)
CPUs, a hardware control called BHI_DIS_S is available, which restricts
history-based predictions.  This control requires updated microcode on some
CPUs.  Look for "bhi-ctrl" in `xen-cpuid -v`, similar to eibrs above.

Xen has been updated to use this control when available, and to virtualise it
for guests to use.

For CPUs without BHI_DIS_S, BHB clearing sequences need using.  Out of an
abundance of caution, all sequences in the Intel whitepaper have been
implemented, although Xen will only use the "short" sequence by default.  The
others are available to opt in to.

The work to mitigate Native-BHI is extensive, and the backports are
more-extensive still.

Therefore, we have decided to produce new releases on all stable trees.
Please find fixes in the respective branches under the following release
tags:

  RELEASE-4.18.2
  RELEASE-4.17.4
  RELEASE-4.16.6
  RELEASE-4.15.6

Other release activities (tarballs, announcements, etc) will happen in
due course.

Issues were in those found subsequently.  To address those, newer commits
from the stable branches need updating to, in particular

stable-4.15	056500003eb44314cb90f2e3e7b2d405e86b5657
stable-4.16	d0e8f8ffbb19b5df5f767328baeb54c069b08e6a
stable-4.17	effcf70f020ff12d34c80e2abde0ecb00ce92bda
stable-4.18	f0ff1d9cb96041a84a24857a6464628240deed4f

For 4.15, since we're closing the branch, RELEASE-4.15.7 was tagged in
addition; other release activities - as per above - will follow.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

## Overview

[Branch Target Injection](/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/advisory-guidance/branch-target-injection.html) (BTI) (sometimes referred to as *Spectre variant 2*) is a known [cross-domain transient execution attack](/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/best-practices/refined-speculative-execution-terminology.html) where an attacker may seek to cause a disclosure gadget to be speculatively executed after an indirect branch prediction.

Generally, transient execution attacks require an attacker to be able to run code on the same machine (or the same virtual machine) as the data they are attempting to read, but do not have access to the data (such as where privilege-level isolation is in place). The recommendations below are applicable to situations where transient execution attacks are within the user's threat model.

Intra-mode BTI (IMBTI) refers to a variant of BTI where an indirect branch speculates to an aliased predictor entry for a different indirect branch1 in the same [predictor mode](/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/best-practices/related-intel-security-features-technologies.html), and a disclosure gadget at the predicted target will transiently execute. Such predictor entries may contain targets corresponding to the targets of indirect near jump, indirect near call and/or near return instructions, even if these branches were only transiently executed. Managed runtimes can provide an attacker with the means to create the aliasing required for intra-mode BTI attacks. IMBTI has been assigned CVE-2022-0002 with a CVSS base score of 4.7 (Medium) CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.

Branch History Injection (BHI) describes a specific form of intra-mode BTI, where an attacker may manipulate branch history before transitioning from user to supervisor or guest to VMX root mode in an effort to cause an indirect branch predictor to select a specific predictor entry for an indirect branch, and a disclosure gadget at the predicted target will transiently execute. This may be possible since the relevant branch history may contain branches taken in previous security contexts, and in particular, in other predictor modes. BHI as been assigned CVE-2022-0001 with a CVSS base score of 4.7 (Medium) CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.

Researchers from [VU Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/en) have demonstrated BHI and intra-mode BTI attacks against the Linux\* kernel by creating a kernel-mode disclosure gadget using a feature known as eBPF (the extended Berkeley Packet Filter). The indirect branch in the Linux system call dispatcher may then speculatively select an indirect branch predictor entry—based on partially attacker-controlled branch history—which corresponds to the attacker’s eBPF disclosure gadget. While the kernel eBPF verifier mitigates most transient execution attack variants, at the time of writing it does not defend against this form of attack.

**Update:** Since this guidance was originally published in 2022, the VU Amsterdam researchers have proposed new software techniques to identify and potentially exploit disclosure gadgets using BHI. Intel has added additional information to the [technical documentation](/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/technical-documentation/branch-history-injection.html) to address this development ([Guidelines for Applying Additional Hardening Options](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/technical-documentation/branch-history-injection.html#guidelines-additional-hardening)). OS and VMM software vendors may wish to consider a broader range of potential approaches when deciding on appropriate mitigation options, such as those described in the [Additional Hardening Options](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/technical-documentation/branch-history-injection.html#additional-hardening-options) section. The [Software BHB-clearing Sequence](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/technical-documentation/branch-history-injection.html#bhb-clearing-sequence) section has been updated to add descriptive names for each software sequence, and the [Software Mitigations in Migration Pools](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/technical-documentation/branch-history-injection.html#migration-pools) section has also been updated to describe improvements to the virtual MSR interface.

On BHI-affected processors, Intel recommends disabling unprivileged eBPF, enabling eIBRS and enabling [SMEP](/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/best-practices/related-intel-security-features-technologies.html). This will mitigate the demonstrated BHI attack as well as other intra-mode BTI attacks using eBPF. This makes transient execution attacks more difficult in general and is the current default configuration for most Linux distributions. Refer to the [Branch History Injection technical guidance](/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/technical-documentation/branch-history-injection.html) for more detailed mitigation guidance.

In addition to the demonstrated attacks using eBPF, the possibility exists that there may be other BHI attacks identified in the future. Such potential BHI attacks can be mitigated by adding LFENCE to specific identified gadgets that are found to be exploitable. The BHI technical guidance provides details on this and other mitigation options which could be considered for various threat models, including software BHB clearing sequences which can be executed when transitioning between domains, BHB-specific indirect predictor disable controls, or retpoline.

Future processors are expected to mitigate BHI attacks in hardware, and the BHI technical guidance describes the way in which future hardware will enumerate such hardware mitigation. In situations where these BHI mitigations are not viable, or environments where intra-mode BTI is a concern (for example, where managed runtimes like unprivileged eBPF are in use), potential mitigations for intra-mode BTI are also included.

## Mitigations

Intel has updated the BHI mitigation guidance in response to new external research that has identified additional disclosure gadgets in the Linux kernel. Customers may wish to implement additional software hardening as described in the [Additional Hardening Options](/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/technical-documentation/branch-history-injection.html#additional-hardening-options) section and the new [Guidelines for Applying Additional Hardening Options](/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/technical-documentation/branch-history-injection.html#guidelines-additional-hardening) section in the [Branch History Injection technical guidance](/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/technical-documentation/branch-history-injection.html) to address these new developments.

## [Affected Processors](/content/www/us/en/developer/topic-technology/software-security-guidance/processors-affected-consolidated-product-cpu-model.html)

Refer to the *Branch History Injection* (CVE-2022-0001) and *Intra-mode Branch Target Injection* (CVE-2022-0002) columns of the [consolidated Affected Processors table](/content/www/us/en/developer/topic-technology/software-security-guidance/processors-affected-consolidated-product-cpu-model.html) (2022 tab) linked above, which indicate the processors for which privileged code may be affected by BHI (CVE-2022-0001) and/or intra-mode BTI (CVE-2022-0002) when the IBRS/eIBRS mitigations against BTI are properly applied. For example, this table may indicate that a processor is not affected by intra-mode BTI if IBRS or retpoline applied to privileged (kernel or VMM) code stops all speculative execution at the targets of indirect jumps and calls; even though the behavior behind intra-mode BTI may occur when IBRS or retpoline is not applied (for example, to application code).

# InSpectre Gadget

This is the official repository for the InSpectre Gadget tool.

This code has been developed as part of our ["InSpectre Gadget" paper](https://download.vusec.net/papers/inspectre_sec24.pdf) (accepted
at 33rd USENIX Security Symposium 2024).

**Disclaimer**

This tool is a research project still under development. It should not be
considered a production-grade tool by any means.

## Description

InSpectre Gadget is a tool for inspecting potential Spectre disclosure gadgets
and performing exploitability analysis.

Documentation can be found at <https://vusec.github.io/inspectre-gadget>.

## Usage

A typical workflow might look something like this:

```
# Run the analyzer on a binary to find transmissions.
mkdir out
inspectre analyze <BINARY> --address-list <CSV> --config config_all.yaml --output out/gadgets.csv --tfp-output output/tfp.csv --asm out/asm

# Evaluate exploitability.
inspectre reason gadgets.csv gadgets-reasoned.csv

# Import the CSV in a database and query the results.
# You can use any DB, this is just an example with sqlite3.
sqlite3 :memory: -cmd '.mode csv' -cmd '.separator ;' -cmd '.import gadgets-reasoned.csv gadgets' -cmd '.mode table' < queries/exploitable_list.sql

# Manually inspect interesting candidates.
inspectre show <UUID>
```
