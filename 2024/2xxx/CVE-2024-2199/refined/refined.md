    "Root cause": "Malformed userPassword input during modification leads to a crash in `slapd/modify.c`",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Malformed userPassword input can cause a crash in `do_modify` function.",
        "Improper handling of userPassword attribute leading to a denial-of-service."
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service by crashing the LDAP server.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered when modifying the `userPassword` attribute using a specially crafted malformed input via an LDAP query.",
    "Attacker capabilities": "An authenticated user is required to send a malformed LDAP query to modify the `userPassword` attribute and cause a server crash.",
    "Affected products": [
        "Red Hat Directory Server 11.8",
        "Red Hat Directory Server 11.9",
