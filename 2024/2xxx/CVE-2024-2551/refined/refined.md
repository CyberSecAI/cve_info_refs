- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference (CWE-476) that can be triggered through a crafted packet.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by stopping a core system service on the firewall. Repeated attempts can lead the firewall to enter maintenance mode.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, exploiting the data plane of the firewall with a specially crafted packet.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need authentication to trigger the vulnerability, and only needs network access to send the crafted packets.
