- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the GlobalProtect gateway.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Null pointer dereference (CWE-476).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by stopping the GlobalProtect service. Repeated attempts can cause the firewall to enter maintenance mode.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted packet to the GlobalProtect gateway.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to a firewall with a configured GlobalProtect gateway. No authentication is required.
