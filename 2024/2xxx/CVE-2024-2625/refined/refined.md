Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-2625:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an "Object lifecycle issue in V8". V8 is the JavaScript engine used in Chromium. This implies a flaw in how V8 manages the creation, usage, and destruction of objects, leading to potential memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Object lifecycle issue: A problem in managing the lifespan of objects in the V8 JavaScript engine, resulting in use-after-free or double-free conditions, or other memory errors

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact of this vulnerability is considered **High**.
- Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to gain control of the affected system.
- It may also lead to denial-of-service via crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a malicious webpage or script that exploits the object lifecycle issue within V8.
- The attacker can trigger this vulnerability through user interaction with a specially crafted web page or by directing the user to a malicious site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to create a webpage that contains malicious JavaScript code designed to trigger the specific vulnerability in V8.
- The attacker would need to entice a user to visit the malicious webpage using social engineering or other methods, or by injecting malicious code into a legitimate website.
- The attacker does not need any privileged access to exploit the vulnerability from the web context.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content confirms the vulnerability is fixed in Chromium version 123.0.6312.58.
