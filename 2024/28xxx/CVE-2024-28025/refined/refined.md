Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-28025:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `/wbm/cgi-bin/p/adm/io` cgi-bin file. Specifically, the values of the `btn1`, `out1`, and `timer1` HTTP parameters are directly injected into OS commands executed via the `system()` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The primary vulnerability is an OS command injection. The application constructs OS commands by concatenating user-controlled input without sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary command execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands with root privileges on the affected device. This could lead to a full system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP request:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `/cgi-bin/p/adm/io` endpoint. The malicious payload is placed within the `btn1`, `out1`, or `timer1` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Network access:** The attacker must have network access to the router's web interface.

**Specifics of CVE-2024-28025:**
- The content specifies that when the HTTP parameter `btn1` is provided with an attacker-controlled value, that value is directly injected into the following command: `/usr/sbin/vout %s %u vo_manual`, where `%s` is the provided value, and executed using `system()`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The report indicates two other similar command injection vulnerabilities in the same file, accessible via the `out1` parameter (CVE-2024-28026) and the `timer1` parameter (CVE-2024-28027).
- The vulnerable code is located in the `form_handler` function at offset `0x8cec`.
