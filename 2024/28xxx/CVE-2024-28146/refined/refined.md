Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-28146:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The application uses hard-coded credentials for various purposes, including encrypting configuration files, decrypting firmware updates, and accessing the database server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Hard-coded Credentials:** The presence of hard-coded usernames and passwords within the application's files. This includes credentials for database access, firmware update decryption, and config file encryption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database by leveraging hard-coded credentials.
*   **Data Manipulation:** With database access, attackers could potentially manipulate or exfiltrate sensitive data.
*   **Firmware Modification:** The hardcoded credentials used for firmware updates could potentially be used to install malicious or modified firmware.
*   **Configuration Modification:** Attackers could potentially access the encrypted configuration files if they have the appropriate encryption key.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct Access:** Attackers who gain access to the file system of the affected device (via other vulnerabilities) can find the hardcoded credentials by examining the files of the Scan2Net application, such as `/opt/s2n/www/cgi/infoio.cgi`, `/opt/s2n/www/cgi/sysupd-*`,  `/opt/s2n/www/class/LocaleImport.php`,  `/opt/s2n/www/class/DBmysqli.php`, and `/opt/s2n/www/class/dbconnect.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **System Access:**  Requires the attacker to have some form of access to the file system of the scanner device.
*   **Network Access:** This vulnerability is often combined with other vulnerabilities to achieve complete system access, indicating that network access to the device is a prerequisite.

**Additional Information:**
*   The advisory mentions that while some of the hardcoded credentials have been rotated or changed in later versions, many of the credentials are still present. The most problematic user account ("support") had its password changed, but the storage location is not readily apparent.

**Summary:**
CVE-2024-28146 is due to the presence of hardcoded credentials within the Image Access Scan2Net software. This allows attackers who have file system access to gain unauthorized access to various parts of the system and its database, manipulate configuration files and possibly the firmware.
