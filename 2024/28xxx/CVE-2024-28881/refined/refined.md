- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Uncontrolled search path in the IntelÂ® Fortran Compiler Classic software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software does not properly control the search path, allowing an attacker to influence the locations from which the compiler loads libraries or other resources.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows for escalation of privilege by an authenticated user with local access.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access by an authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with local access to the system running the vulnerable software. The attack also requires user interaction (UI:R/A).
