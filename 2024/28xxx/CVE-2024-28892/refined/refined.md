- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `name` parameter, used to create a label for a loopback interface, is not properly sanitized before being used in a command executed by the system. This allows for OS command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS Command Injection (CWE-78), lack of input sanitization, lack of authentication for the HTTP API.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary command execution on the host system. An attacker can execute malicious commands on the vulnerable system.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted HTTP request to the GoCast API. The vulnerability can also be triggered via the config file or Consul integration.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can make an unauthenticated HTTP request to trigger the vulnerability.

The vulnerability exists in the `addLoopback` function within `system.go`. The `name` parameter is used in the command `ip address add %s/%d dev lo label %s`, and the lack of sanitization allows injection of malicious commands. The default configuration of GoCast enables the HTTP API without any authentication, exacerbating the issue. The length of the injectable string is limited by the maximum size of Linux kernel network interface labels to 12 characters, although it may still be sufficient for exploitation.
