# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2024-1960

## GoCast name parameter OS command injection vulnerability

##### November 21, 2024

##### CVE Number

CVE-2024-28892

##### SUMMARY

An OS command injection vulnerability exists in the name parameter of GoCast 1.1.3. A specially crafted HTTP request can lead to arbitrary command execution. An attacker can make an unauthenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

GoCast 1.1.3

##### PRODUCT URLS

GoCast - <https://github.com/mayuresh82/gocast>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

9.8 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-78 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (‘OS Command Injection’)

##### DETAILS

Gocast does BGP route advertisements from a host using GoBGP.

In GoCast an injection was found when the name of an app is used to create the label of a new loopback interface.
This injection has been demonstrated using the HTTP API, but could also be exploitable when the App is defined through the config file or if added due to Consul integration. Due to a lack of authentication, the HTTP API should be disabled in most environments or configured to only go through a proxy that adds authentication, but it should be noted that this API is enabled in the default config file.

Name triggers an injection in system.go:addLoopback but is limited to a string length of 12 characters due to the limited size of Linux Kernal network interfact labels.

```
func addLoopback(name string, addr *net.IPNet) error {
	deleteLoopback(addr)
	prefixLen, _ := addr.Mask.Size()
	label := fmt.Sprintf("lo:%s", name)
	// linux kernel limits labels to 15 chars
	if len(label) > 15 {
		label = label[:15]
	}
	cmd := fmt.Sprintf("ip address add %s/%d dev lo label %s", addr.IP.String(), prefixLen, label)
	cmdList := getCmdList(cmd)
	_, err := exec.Command(execCmd, cmdList...).Output()

```
### Mitigation

Users of GoCast should disable the HTTP API or put it behind authentication if it can’t be. Disable Consul integration if possible. Check that the file permissions for the configuration file prevent users other than root and the GoCast user from modifying the file.

There are many ways to prevent command injections. For minimal changes to the codebase, a good method would be to surround the label argument that contains user input with single quotes and remove all single quotes from the label string before inserting it into the command.

Example:

```
label = strings.ReplaceAll(label,"'","") // replace all single quotes with nothing
cmd := fmt.Sprintf("ip address add %s/%d dev lo label '%s'", addr.IP.String(), prefixLen, label)
cmdList := getCmdList(cmd)

```
