- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web interface of the MC Technologies MC LR Router contains OS command injection vulnerabilities. User-supplied input from HTTP parameters `btn1`, `out1`, and `timer1` is directly injected into OS commands without proper sanitization and executed with root privileges via the `system` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS command injection (CWE-78). The application does not sanitize user input before using it to construct shell commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands with root privileges on the device.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the `/cgi-bin/p/adm/io` URI, including the `out1` parameter containing malicious shell commands in the value.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send authenticated HTTP requests to the vulnerable web interface of the MC Technologies MC LR Router.
