```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `strcpy` function in `/src/ifaces.c` does not perform bounds checking, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121)",
    "Uncontrolled copy of data to a fixed-size buffer"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's system with the privileges of the `iptraf-ng` process, typically root.",
  "Attack vectors": "By providing a crafted configuration file via the `-C` argument or injecting a long string into the `-i` argument.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to provide a malicious configuration file or control the content of the input, and must have the ability to execute the `iptraf-ng` command."
