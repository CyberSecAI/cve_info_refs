# Deserialization of Untrusted Data

Critical

[tabacitu](/tabacitu)
published
GHSA-8237-957h-h2c2
Nov 13, 2024

## Package

composer

backpack/filemanager
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

<3.0.8
2.\*
1.\*

## Patched versions

3.0.9
2.0.2

## Description

### Impact

Deserialization of untrusted data from the `mimes` parameter could lead to remote code execution.

### Patches

Fixed in 3.0.9

### Workarounds

Not needed, a `composer update` will solve it in a non-breaking way.

### References

Reported responsibly [Vladislav Gladkiy](https://github.com/catferq) at [Positive Technologies](https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/).

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-52306

### Weaknesses
