The provided content relates to CVE-2024-52306.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the deserialization of untrusted data within the `mimes` parameter. Specifically, the application was decrypting the `mimes` parameter which was then being serialized again and used without sanitization. An attacker could manipulate the encrypted data in the `mimes` parameter to inject malicious PHP objects.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Deserialization of untrusted data (CWE-502)
- Lack of input validation/sanitization

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network (via HTTP request)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the application with a malicious, specially crafted encrypted value for the `mimes` parameter.
- The application must be accessible to the attacker.
- No privileges are needed to exploit, but user interaction is required.
