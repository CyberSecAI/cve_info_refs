- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin "Disable Admin Notices individually" lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions on the website, under their authentication context. Specific impact may vary depending on the actions implemented in the plugin.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is carried out through a crafted request that targets a vulnerable function within the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to entice an authenticated user to unknowingly trigger a malicious request. The attacker does not require any prior authentication.
