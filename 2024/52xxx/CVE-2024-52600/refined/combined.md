# Path Traversal in Asset Upload

Moderate

[jasonvarga](/jasonvarga)
published
GHSA-p7f6-8mcm-fwv3
Nov 19, 2024

## Package

composer

statamic/cms
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

<= 5.16.0

## Patched versions

5.17.0

## Description

Assets uploaded with appropriately crafted filenames may result in them being placed in a location different than what was configured.

### Impact

* Affects front-end forms with `assets` fields.
* Affects other places where assets can be uploaded, although users would need upload permissions anyway.
* Files can be uploaded so they would be located on the server in a different location, and potentially override existing files.
* Traversal *outside* an asset container was not possible.

### Patches

This has been fixed in 5.17.0.

### Severity

Moderate

5.3

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

### CVE ID
