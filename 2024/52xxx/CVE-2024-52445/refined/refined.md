- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress QRMenu Restaurant QR Menu Lite plugin is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection. This type of vulnerability arises when unserialized data from an untrusted source is used to create objects, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution if a suitable POP chain exists.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to code injection, SQL injection, path traversal, denial of service, and other malicious activities. The exact impact depends on the specific context and the presence of a usable POP (Property-Oriented Programming) chain.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the injection of malicious serialized PHP objects into the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a Contributor or higher privileged WordPress user to inject the malicious payload.
