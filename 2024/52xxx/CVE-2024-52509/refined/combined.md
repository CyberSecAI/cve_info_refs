For now it silently Fails on draft/outbox save/update

* Find a way to reflect in the front end for versions prior to 3.6 if needed (not needed)

The backend side works. When sending the mail a warning is logged, the attachment is still shown in the frontend (composer) but not sent.

I wonder why the frontend let's me pick a file without download permissions. Shouldn't the file picker filter incoming shares without download permissions?

Sorry, something went wrong.

# Mail app does not respect download permissions in shares

Low

[nickvergessen](/nickvergessen)
published
GHSA-pwpp-fvcr-w862
Nov 15, 2024

## Package

Mail
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

>=2.2.0, >= 3.6.0, >= 3.7.0

## Patched versions

2.2.10, 3.6.2, 3.7.2

## Description

### Impact

The Nextcloud mail app incorrectly allowed attaching shared files without download permissions as attachments. This allowed users to send them the files to themselves and then downloading it from their mail clients.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Mail is upgraded to 2.2.10, 3.6.2 or 3.7.2

### Workarounds

* Disable app mail

### References

* [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/reports/1878255)
* [PullRequest](https://github.com/nextcloud/mail/pull/9592)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
