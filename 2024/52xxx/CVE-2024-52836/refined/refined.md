The provided content is related to CVE-2024-52836.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by a Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS) vulnerability
*   **Weaknesses:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input that is stored and later rendered in a web page. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious script into the context of the application.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).  An attacker with low privileges (PR:L) can inject malicious script that will be executed when another user views the affected page.  This requires user interaction (UI:R).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs low privileges within the application and needs to be able to inject malicious code, which will then be executed when a user views the affected page.
