### @KatrinIhler **[KatrinIhler](/KatrinIhler)** commented [Aug 1, 2023](#issue-1830919757)

Instead of stopping once maxRetryAttempts has been reached, Opencast will try to query or update Elasticsearch endlessly when encountering an ElasticsearchStatusException. This was broken by [#4120](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/4120).

Sorry, something went wrong.

# Searching Opencast may cause a denial of service

Moderate

published
GHSA-jh6x-7xfg-9cq2

## Package

maven

opencast
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

<13.10, <14.3

## Patched versions

13.10, 14.3, follow on patch in 16.7

## Description

### Impact

First noticed in Opencast 13 and 14, Opencast's Elasticsearch integration may generate syntactically invalid Elasticsearch queries in relation to previously acceptable search queries. From Opencast version 11.4 and newer, Elasticsearch queries are retried a configurable number of times in the case of error to handle temporary losses of connection to Elasticsearch. These invalid queries would fail, causing the retry mechanism to begin requerying with the same syntactically invalid query immediately, in an infinite loop. This causes a massive increase in log size which can in some cases cause a denial of service due to disk exhaustion.

### Patches

Opencast 13.10 and Opencast 14.3 contain patches ([#5150](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/5150), and [#5033](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/5033)) which address the base issue, with Opencast 16.7 containing changes which harmonize the search behaviour between the admin UI and external API. Users are strongly recommended to upgrade as soon as possible if running versions prior to 13.10 or 14.3. While the relevant endpoints require (by default) `ROLE_ADMIN` or `ROLE_API_SERIES_VIEW`, the problem queries are otherwise innocuous. This issue could be easily triggered by normal administrative work on an affected Opencast system. If you are running a version newer than 13.10 and 14.3 *and* seeing different results when searching in your admin UI vs your external API or LMS, upgrading to 16.7 should resolve the issue.

### Workarounds

None identified.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @Arnei **[Arnei](/Arnei)** commented [Jun 8, 2023](#issue-1748108619)

Some external API endpoints have optional query parameters that are internally treated as ElasticSearch queries. Endpoint users are not informed about this, due to which they may include characters in their parameter that are actually reserved in Elasticsearch without escaping them. At best, the endpoint then might return unexpected results, at worst it goes into an endless loops that spams the Opencast log with error messages until the disk is full.

Example: The `/api/series/series.json` endpoint. Set the parameter `q` to `T9-VB-20-Online:`.

This commit suggests fixing the problem by adding a method for sanitizing parameters. It simply escapes ElasticSearch reserved characters.

Another way of fixing this would be to explicitly inform users that a certain parameter will be an ElasticSearch query and let them decide which reserved characters they want to escape in their query.

If people are happy with simply sanitizing incoming strings, the code suggested here could likely be approved upon by burying it deeper in the Elasticsearch modules. But that's a pain so I refrained from doing that for now ^^'.

Sorry, something went wrong.
