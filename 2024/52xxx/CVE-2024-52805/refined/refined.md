{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way Synapse handles `multipart/form-data` requests, where it may process and store the entire request body in memory before parsing, without proper size limits or streaming capabilities. This behavior is due to how Twisted Web parses form data from POST requests.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling",
      "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by sending large `multipart/form-data` requests. This leads to excessive memory consumption on the server, potentially slowing it down or causing it to crash.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending crafted HTTP POST requests with a `multipart/form-data` content type and large payloads."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Synapse server. No authentication or specific network position is required.",
        "details": "The `twisted.web.http.Request` class reads the entire request body into memory when parsing form data, specifically through `email.message_from_bytes`, and stores it in `request.args`. There are no limits on the size of individual form values. The issue is not with `request.content`, where the body is initially buffered, but with the parsing of form parameters that are stored in `Request.args`."
