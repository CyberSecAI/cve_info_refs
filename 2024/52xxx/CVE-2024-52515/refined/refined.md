Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-52515:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insufficient sanitization of SVG files within Nextcloud's preview functionality. Specifically, the application fails to properly validate references (specifically, `xlink:href` and `href` attributes) within SVG files, allowing for the embedding of other local files into the preview.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate input sanitization for SVG files, particularly regarding external references.
- Failure to block or sanitize `xlink:href` and `href` attributes in SVG files, allowing the inclusion of external resources.
- The SVG preview provider is disabled by default, but enabling it introduces the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach**: A malicious user could craft an SVG file that references another file on the server. When a user views the preview of this SVG file, the contents of the referenced file are displayed instead, potentially exposing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious user uploads a crafted SVG file to the Nextcloud server.
- An admin must enable the SVG preview provider for the attack to be viable.
- When another user previews the malicious SVG, the embedded content from the referenced file is loaded, resulting in a confidentiality breach.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account on the Nextcloud instance to upload files.
- The attacker needs to craft an SVG file containing malicious references to other files.
- An administrator must enable the SVG preview provider for this exploit to be possible.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity with a CVSS v3 score of 5.7.
- The affected versions include Nextcloud Server versions 27.0.0, 28.0.0, and 29.0.0 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions 24.0.0, 25.0.0, 26.0.0, 27.0.0, 28.0.0 and 29.0.0
- Patched versions are available: Nextcloud Server 27.1.10, 28.0.6, 29.0.1 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server 24.0.12.15, 25.0.13.10, 26.0.13.4, 27.1.10, 28.0.6, 29.0.1.
- Workarounds include disabling SVG previews.
- The fix involves extending the SVG reference check by blocking all `xlink:href` and `href` attributes.
- The relevant code changes can be seen in the provided diffs for `lib/private/Preview/SVG.php` and `tests/lib/Preview/SVGTest.php`.
