# Request smuggling due to incorrect parsing of chunk extensions

Low

[Dreamsorcerer](/Dreamsorcerer)
published
GHSA-8495-4g3g-x7pr
Nov 18, 2024

## Package

pip

aiohttp
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<= 3.10.10

## Patched versions

3.10.11

## Description

### Summary

The Python parser parses newlines in chunk extensions incorrectly which can lead to request smuggling vulnerabilities under certain conditions.

### Impact

If a pure Python version of aiohttp is installed (i.e. without the usual C extensions) or `AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS` is enabled, then an attacker may be able to execute a request smuggling attack to bypass certain firewalls or proxy protections.

Patch: [259edc3](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/commit/259edc369075de63e6f3a4eaade058c62af0df71)

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-52304

### Weaknesses

[CWE-444](/advisories?query=cwe%3A444)
