  "CVE-2024-52059": {
    "root_cause": "A heap buffer overflow vulnerability occurred in the Security Plugins while creating a DomainParticipant that used a malformed Identity Certificate.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap buffer overflow (CWE-122)",
        "Integer Overflow or Wraparound (CWE-190)"
    ],
    "impact": "The application could experience a heap buffer overwrite during the creation of a new DomainParticipant that attempted to use the malicious Identity Certificate, impacting the integrity and availability of the application.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Overwriting the Identity Certificate on the file system with a malicious Identity Certificate.",
         "Exploitable if the `authentication.propagate_simplified_identity_certificate` property was unset or set to `TRUE`."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to have write access to the file system where the Identity Certificate is stored and be able to overwrite the certificate file. The vulnerability is much easier to exploit on a 32-bit architecture compared to 64-bit, and only affects the Security Plugins for OpenSSL on 64-bit."
