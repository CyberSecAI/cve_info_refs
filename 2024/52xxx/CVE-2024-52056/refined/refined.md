*   The provided content explicitly mentions CVE-2024-52056 within the context of multiple vulnerabilities in Wowza Streaming Engine. The description matches, confirming relevance.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to an injection flaw within the Wowza Streaming Engine REST API that permits an administrator user to manipulate directory paths during the deletion of an application.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Path Traversal/Injection
    *   Specifically, the vulnerability arises because the application name used in the deletion process is not properly sanitized by the REST API and an authenticated administrator can inject special characters to manipulate the file system operations.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An authenticated administrator can delete any directory on the host system if the targeted directory contains an XML file.
    *   This can lead to data loss, service disruption, and potentially system instability if crucial system directories are targeted.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability can be exploited via the Wowza Streaming Engine REST API.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have administrator-level access to the Wowza Streaming Engine Manager and/or the REST API.

**3. Additional Details (Beyond CVE Description):**

*   The vulnerability is part of a series of related vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-52052, CVE-2024-52053, CVE-2024-52054, CVE-2024-52055, and CVE-2024-52056) that were discovered and reported by Rapid7.
*   It affects Wowza Streaming Engine versions prior to 4.9.1.
