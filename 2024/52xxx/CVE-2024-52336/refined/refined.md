{
  "cveId": "CVE-2024-52336",
  "description": "The `script_pre` and `script_post` options in the `instance_create()` D-Bus method of the Tuned daemon allow a local, unprivileged attacker to pass arbitrary scripts with absolute paths, which are then executed with root privileges. This allows for a local root exploit.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The `instance_create()` D-Bus method does not properly sanitize the `script_pre` and `script_post` parameters, allowing arbitrary scripts to be passed. The only check performed is that the path is absolute, but no validation to ensure the script is from a trusted location is performed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate input sanitization",
      "Improper privilege management",
      "Command injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Local privilege escalation to root. An attacker can execute arbitrary code with root privileges by injecting a malicious script via D-Bus.",
    "attackVectors": "By crafting a malicious D-Bus call to the `instance_create()` method, a local attacker can specify the execution of an arbitrary script with root privileges.",
    "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be a local user logged into the system, no further privileges are required.",
    "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability is present in the `tuned` daemon's D-Bus interface, specifically in the `instance_create` method. The `script_pre` and `script_post` options within the `options` dictionary are vulnerable. The issue was introduced in version 2.23.0."
