This should be easily resolvable if the authors of tuned want to do so,
without needing to resort to relying on hard-to-predict cookie values.
Clients of the D-Bus system bus can identify other clients of the system
bus, by calling the GetConnectionCredentials method on the message bus
itself (this is how polkit works).

So, if tuned's design constraints allow a model where a cookie is only
considered valid to release if it was allocated by the same uid that
made the original request, that would be straightforward to implement.
Pseudocode:

    HoldProfile() -> cookie:
        get the caller's unique bus name (looks like e.g. :1.23)
        call GetConnectionCredentials(":1.23") to get the UnixUserID
        allocate a cookie
        store {cookie: uid} in a hash table
        return cookie

    ReleaseProfile(cookie):
        get the caller's unique bus name (looks like e.g. :1.23)
        call GetConnectionCredentials(":1.23") to get the UnixUserID

        look up the cookie's corresponding uid in the hash table

        if cookie not found || caller_uid != cookie_uid:
            error "No such cookie owned by this uid"

        ... continue to release the profile

Any good-quality D-Bus client library should have API to get the unique
bus name of the caller while handling an incoming method call. The most
commonly-used client libraries (dbus' libdbus, GLib's GDBus, systemd's
sd-bus) can certainly do that.

Treating each uid as a trust domain is the most common way to handle
system bus security, but on Linux, various other fields are conditionally
available in the result of GetConnectionCredentials if tuned wants to
implement some more complicated security model (for example looking at
the SELinux/AppArmor/Smack security label, which is available on D-Bus as
the LinuxSecurityLabel credential).

(Behind the scenes, this is implemented by the message bus using
SO_PEERCRED, SO_PEERSEC, etc. on each client connection, or the closest
available equivalent of SO_PEERCRED on various non-Linux OSs.)

Or, if the tuned authors want to implement a model where only the same
bus connection that initially called HoldProfile can call ReleaseProfile,
that's even simpler, because it doesn't need GetConnectionCredentials:
tuned could remember the unique bus name of the caller of HoldProfile,
and only allow ReleaseProfile to be called by a matching unique bus
name. If this is the chosen model, it will probably also want to watch for
NameOwnerChanged signals, so that it can automatically release the profile
when the requester disconnects from the message bus. In particular,
if the requester crashes, this disconnection will happen automatically
when the kernel cleans up its resources, which is not directly
security-relevant but seems likely to be desirable anyway.

Subject: tuned: local root exploit in D-Bus method instance_create and other
 issues in tuned >= 2.23 (CVE-2024-52336, CVE-2024-52337)

Hello list,

this is a report a about a local root exploit and some other issues in
tuned [1]. We also offer a rendered version of this report on our blog
[2].

1) Introduction
===============

Tuned is a privileged daemon for Linux that supports
automatic tuning of various hardware and kernel settings during runtime.
The daemon offers a comprehensive D-Bus interface protected by Polkit
authentication. We regularly perform reviews of newly introduced D-Bus
system services and changes to them. Tuned sees frequent additions to
its D-Bus interface and this is already the tenth review of it that we
carried out since 2019. Usually the reviews are straightforward and we
have no complaints, but this time was the exception.

During the review we checked the D-Bus methods matching the following
Polkit actions:

    com.redhat.tuned.instance_create        (auth_admin:auth_admin:yes)
    com.redhat.tuned.instance_destroy       (auth_admin:auth_admin:yes)
    net.hadess.PowerProfiles.HoldProfile    (no:no:yes)
    net.hadess.PowerProfiles.ReleaseProfile (no:no:yes)

This report is based on tuned release v2.24.0.

2) Problems in the `instance_create` D-Bus Method
=================================================

Calling the `instance_create()` D-Bus method is allowed without
authentication for locally logged-in users (`yes` Polkit setting). The
method call accepts various parameters, including an `options`
dictionary, that are fully under attacker control.

2a) Script Options Allow Local Root Exploit (CVE-2024-52336)
------------------------------------------------------------

The `script_pre` and `script_post` options allow to pass arbitrary
scripts that will be executed by _root_. The parameters are extracted in
daemon/controller.py:459 [3], stored unmodified in a new `Instance`
object and the only verification of the script path is performed in
plugins/base.py:222 [4]:

```
    if not script.startswith("/"):
        log.error("Relative paths cannot be used in script_pre or script_post. " \
                + "Use ${i:PROFILE_DIR}.")
        return False
```

So the only requirement is that an absolute path is passed. Thus,
scripts under control of an unprivileged user can be passed here. This
allows for a local root exploit.

### Reproducer

As a locally logged-in non-privileged user execute the following D-Bus
call:

```
    $ gdbus call -y -d com.redhat.tuned -o /Tuned \
        -m com.redhat.tuned.control.instance_create cpu myinstance \
        '{"script_pre": "/path/to/myscript.sh", "devices": "*"}'
```

The path _/path/to/myscript.sh_ needs to be replaced by a path to a user
controlled executable script or program. It will be executed by tuned
with root privileges.

2b) Instance Name can Contain Arbitrary Data (CVE-2024-52337)
-------------------------------------------------------------

The `instance_name` parameter of the `instance_create()` method is not
sanitized. This string is later on used in logging and in the output of
utilities like `tuned-adm get_instances`, or other third party programs
that utilize tuned's D-Bus interface to obtain instance names.

A local attacker can include arbitrary data in the instance name and can
achieve log spoofing this way. By placing newline characters into the
name, seemingly independent, legitimate-looking entries can be added to
the tuned log. By adding terminal control sequences the terminal
emulators of administrators or other users can be influenced. The
following is a Proof-of-Concept for this:

```
    $ EVIL=`echo -e "this is\nevil\033[?1047h"`
    $ gdbus call -y -d com.redhat.tuned -o /Tuned -m com.redhat.tuned.control.instance_create cpu "$EVIL" '{"devices": "*"}'
```

When another user now calls `tuned-adm get_instances` then the terminal
emulator will switch to the alternate screen upon output of the crafted
instance name.

Affectedness
------------

The `instance_create()` D-Bus method has been added via upstream commit
cddcd233 [5] and was first part of version tag v2.23.0. The initial
version already contained support for the script option parameters and
the `instance_name` parameter.

3) Problems in the PowerProfiles Interface
==========================================

3a) Cookie in PowerProfiles API is Predictable
----------------------------------------------

The new D-Bus methods `HoldProfile()` and `ReleaseProfile()` use a
cookie to identify a profile hold. The cookie is simply a continuously
increasing integer starting at zero. This means other users in the
system can easily release the profile holds of any other users.

3b) User Supplied Strings can Contain Arbitrary Data
----------------------------------------------------

The `HoldProfile()` call accepts `reason` and `app_id` strings which are
used in logging and may also be returned as a dictionary via
`ProfileHold.as_dict()`.  These strings can again contain crafted data
that could have side effects similar to the ones shown in section 2b).

Suggested Fix
-------------

A local DoS scenario using the `cookie` would only be an issue on
multi-user systems, or if the Polkit settings are relaxed so that also
non-local sessions can use these D-Bus methods. One way to make this
more robust could be to hand out random `cookie` IDs instead, to make
the attack less trivial.

4) Bugfixes
===========

Upstream published release v2.24.1 [6] that addresses the issues
described in this report. Commit 90c24eea037 [7] contains the cumulative
fixes as follows:

- plugins are now only loaded from trusted locations
  (`_safe_script_path()` function).
- various user supplied strings are rejected if they contain disallowed
  characters (`is_valid_name()` function).
- upstream also tightened the tuned Polkit policy for `instance_create`
  and a number of other actions, that they also found to be problematic
  when accessed by local unprivileged users.

For issue 3a) no upstream fix is available at the moment. This is more
of a hardening suggestion, though.

5) Timeline
===========

2024-11-07: We reported the issues to the Red Hat security team.
2024-11-08: Red Hat security confirmed the issues and communicated the
	    CVE assignments to us, and the publication date of
	    2024-11-26 was suggested.
2024-11-11: Red Hat shared the suggested patch and we reviewed it.
2024-11-26: The publication date has been reached and publication
            happened as planned.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2324540#c0)  OSIDB Bzimport    2024-11-08 13:07:00 UTC  ``` The `script_pre` and `script_post` options allow to pass arbitrary scripts that will be executed by root. The parameters are extracted in "daemon/controller.py:459", stored unmodified in a new `Instance` object and the only verification of the script path is performed in "plugins/base.py:222":  ```     if not script.startswith("/"):         log.error("Relative paths cannot be used in script_pre or script_post. " \                 + "Use ${i:PROFILE_DIR}.")         return False ```  So the only requirement is that an absolute path is passed. Thus scripts under control of an unprivileged user can be passed here. This allows for a local root exploit.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=2324540#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-26 15:44:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2024:10384 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10384](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A10384)   ``` |  |

# 1) Introduction

[Tuned](https://github.com/redhat-performance/tuned) is a privileged daemon for Linux that supports automatic
tuning of various hardware and kernel settings during runtime. The daemon
offers a comprehensive D-Bus interface protected by Polkit authentication. We
regularly perform reviews of newly introduced D-Bus system services and
changes to them. Tuned sees frequent additions to its D-Bus interface and this
is already the tenth review of it that we carried out since 2019. Usually the
reviews are straightforward and we have no complaints, but this time was the
exception.

During the review we checked the D-Bus methods matching the following Polkit
actions:

```
com.redhat.tuned.instance_create        (auth_admin:auth_admin:yes)
com.redhat.tuned.instance_destroy       (auth_admin:auth_admin:yes)
net.hadess.PowerProfiles.HoldProfile    (no:no:yes)
net.hadess.PowerProfiles.ReleaseProfile (no:no:yes)

```

This report is based on tuned release v2.24.0.

# 2) Problems in the `instance_create` D-Bus Method

Calling the `instance_create()` D-Bus method is allowed without
authentication for locally logged-in users (`yes` Polkit setting). The method
call accepts various parameters, including an `options` dictionary, that are
fully under attacker control.

## 2a) Script Options Allow Local Root Exploit (CVE-2024-52336)

The `script_pre` and `script_post` options allow to pass arbitrary scripts
that will be executed by *root*. The parameters are extracted in
[daemon/controller.py:459](https://github.com/redhat-performance/tuned/blob/v2.24.0/tuned/daemon/controller.py#L459), stored unmodified in a new
`Instance` object and the only verification of the script path is performed in
[plugins/base.py:222](https://github.com/redhat-performance/tuned/blob/v2.24.0/tuned/plugins/base.py#L222):

```
    if not script.startswith("/"):
        log.error("Relative paths cannot be used in script_pre or script_post. " \
                + "Use ${i:PROFILE_DIR}.")
        return False

```

So the only requirement is that an absolute path is passed. Thus, scripts
under control of an unprivileged user can be passed here. This allows for a
local root exploit.

### Reproducer

As a locally logged-in non-privileged user execute the following D-Bus call:

```
    $ gdbus call -y -d com.redhat.tuned -o /Tuned \
        -m com.redhat.tuned.control.instance_create cpu myinstance \
        '{"script_pre": "/path/to/myscript.sh", "devices": "*"}'

```

The path */path/to/myscript.sh* needs to be replaced by a path to a user
controlled executable script or program. It will be executed by tuned with
root privileges.

## 2b) Instance Name can Contain Arbitrary Data (CVE-2024-52337)

The `instance_name` parameter of the `instance_create()` method is not
sanitized. This string is later on used in logging and in the output of
utilities like `tuned-adm get_instances`, or other third party programs that
utilize tunedâs D-Bus interface to obtain instance names.

A local attacker can include arbitrary data in the instance name and can
achieve log spoofing this way. By placing newline characters into the name,
seemingly independent, legitimate-looking entries can be added to the tuned
log. By adding terminal control sequences the terminal emulators of
administrators or other users can be influenced. The following is a
Proof-of-Concept for this:

```
    $ EVIL=`echo -e "this is\nevil\033[?1047h"`
    $ gdbus call -y -d com.redhat.tuned -o /Tuned -m com.redhat.tuned.control.instance_create cpu "$EVIL" '{"devices": "*"}'

```

When another user now calls `tuned-adm get_instances` then the terminal emulator
will switch to the alternate screen upon output of the crafted instance name.

## Affectedness

The `instance_create()` D-Bus method has been added via upstream commit
[cddcd233](https://github.com/redhat-performance/tuned/commit/cddcd2336944a56e313324c699dd739fe8f1f85d) and was first part of version tag
v2.23.0. The initial version already contained support for the script option
parameters and the `instance_name` parameter.

# 3) Problems in the PowerProfiles Interface

## 3a) Cookie in PowerProfiles API is Predictable

The new D-Bus methods `HoldProfile()` and `ReleaseProfile()` use a cookie to
identify a profile hold. The cookie is simply a continuously increasing
integer starting at zero. This means other users in the system can easily
release the profile holds of other users.

## 3b) User Supplied Strings can Contain Arbitrary Data

The `HoldProfile()` call accepts `reason` and `app_id` strings which are used
in logging and may also be returned as a dictionary via
`ProfileHold.as_dict()`. These strings can again contain crafted data that
could have side effects similar to the ones shown in section 2b).

## Suggested Fix

A local DoS scenario using the `cookie` would only be an issue on multi-user
systems, or if the Polkit settings are relaxed so that also non-local sessions
can use these D-Bus methods. One way to make this more robust could be to hand
out random `cookie` IDs instead, to make the attack less trivial.

# 4) Bugfixes

Upstream published release [v2.24.1](https://github.com/redhat-performance/tuned/releases/tag/v2.24.1) that addresses the
issues described in this report. [Commit
90c24eea037](https://github.com/redhat-performance/tuned/commit/90c24eea037c7a5e9414c93f8fb3e549ed4a7b06) contains the cumulative fixes as follows:

* plugins are now only loaded from trusted locations (`_safe_script_path()`
  function).
* various user supplied strings are rejected if they contain disallowed
  characters (`is_valid_name()` function).
* upstream also tightened the tuned Polkit policy for `instance_create` and a
  number of other actions, that they also found to be problematic when
  accessed by local unprivileged users.

For issue 3a) no upstream fix is available at the moment. This is more of a
hardening suggestion, though.
