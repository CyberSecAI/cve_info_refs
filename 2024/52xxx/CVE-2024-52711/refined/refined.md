- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `ip_position_asp` function of the DI-8100 router. The `ip` parameter is controllable by the user and is used in a `sprintf` function call, which copies the user-provided input into a fixed-size buffer without proper bounds checking. This can lead to a stack buffer overflow when the length of the `ip` parameter exceeds the buffer's capacity.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the lack of bounds checking when copying the user-controlled `ip` parameter into a buffer using `sprintf`. This lack of validation allows for a buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite other important data on the stack. This can lead to device crashes and potentially more severe consequences. The provided proof of concept (POC) demonstrates that a crafted payload can crash the web service of the device.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `ip_position.asp` endpoint with an overly long `ip` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs network access to the device's web interface. They need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint, which may require authentication if the device requires login for this functionality. The provided POC includes login, indicating that authentication is required for exploitation.
