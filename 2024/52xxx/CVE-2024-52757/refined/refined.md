Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `arp_sys_asp` function of the `jhttpd` executable.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow.
- The `notify` parameter, along with other parameters obtained via HTTP, are used without proper bounds checking leading to the overflow.

**Impact:**
- The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious HTTP request with oversized parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. This typically means they need to be on the same network or have access to the device's web interface.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerable function is `arp_sys_asp` within the `jhttpd` executable.
- The specific parameters that cause the overflow are those obtained via HTTP, including the `notify` parameter.
- The provided images demonstrate the vulnerable function and the resulting crash when exploited.
- The affected product is the D-Link DI-8003 router, specifically firmware version 16.07.16A1.
