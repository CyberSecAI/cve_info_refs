Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `ip_position_asp` function of the D-Link DI-8003 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `ip_position_asp` function does not properly validate the length of the `ip` parameter received via HTTP, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing an attacker to gain full control over the affected device.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the affected router, including an oversized `ip` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router, indicating they need to be on the same network or have a means to send requests to the router remotely if remote access is enabled.

**Additional Details:**
- The affected firmware version is D-Link DI-8003: 16.07.16A1
- The vulnerable executable is `jhttpd`
- The specific function affected is `ip_position_asp`
