# The PDF viewer macro allows accessing any attachment without access right checks

## Package

maven

com.xwiki.pdfviewer:macro-pdfviewer-ui
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 1.6.2

## Patched versions

2.5.6

## Description

### Impact

Any user with view right on `XWiki.PDFViewerService` can access any attachment stored in the wiki as the "key" that is passed to prevent this is computed incorrectly, calling `skip` on the digest stream doesn't update the digest.

To reproduce, create a document named "Secret Document" with a "secret-attachment.png" as user "Admin" and restrict access to it. Then download `http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/get/XWiki/PDFViewerService?reference=xwiki:Secret%20Page.WebHome&filename=secret-attachment.png&user=xwiki:XWiki.Admin&key=G0Wy2P9YyuXPwRVx3S_jyrCAJs0.&xpage=plain`, e.g. using `wget` (downloading in the browser doesn't work unless the attachment is a PDF file). The `key` parameter only depends on the passed user, unless the attacker is logged in which would be necessary to exploit this in a private wiki. In that latter case, the key also depends on the attacker's username. The attacker can compute the key in any XWiki instance (e.g., a local demo instance) by executing the following macro:

```
{{velocity}}
#set ($digestFactory = $services.component.getInstance('org.xwiki.crypto.DigestFactory', 'SHA-1'))
#set ($encoder = $services.component.getInstance('org.xwiki.crypto.BinaryStringEncoder', 'URLBase64'))
#if ($digestFactory && $encoder)
  #set ($digest = $digestFactory.instance)
  #if ($xcontext.userReference)
    #set ($discard = $digest.update($services.model.serialize($xcontext.userReference, 'default').getBytes('UTF-8')))
  #end
  #set ($user = 'xwiki:XWiki.Admin')
  #set ($discard = $digest.update($user.getBytes('UTF-8')))
{{{$encoder.encode($digest.digest)}}}
#end
{{/velocity}}

```

In this code, `xwiki:XWiki.Admin` needs to be changed to the author of the document that contains the secret attachment. The code automatically adds the user, if this is not desired, the line accessing `$xcontext.userReference` can be removed, then the key is for the guest user.

To successfully execute the attack, the attacker needs two pieces of information:

1. the reference of the desired attachment
2. the user reference of a user who can view the attachment

To obtain the reference of the desired attachment, the attacker can access the Page Index, Attachments tab. Even if the UI shows N/A, the user can inspect the page and check the HTTP request that fetches the live data entries. The attachment URL is available in the returned JSON for all attachments, including protected ones and allows getting the necessary values. Getting the reference of a user who can view the attachment is easy as, if in doubt, `xwiki:XWiki.superadmin`, the superadmin account, can be used.

### Patches

Fixed in version 2.5.6

### Workarounds

As a workaround, `XWiki.PDFViewerService` can be deleted as "superadmin", thereby removing the possibility to use the author's rights to view the PDF file.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
