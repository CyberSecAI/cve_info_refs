Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The WordPress Office Locator Plugin, in versions up to 1.3.0, is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI). This likely stems from the plugin not properly sanitizing user-supplied input when handling file paths, allowing attackers to manipulate the input to include arbitrary files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The core vulnerability is LFI, where an attacker can include local files from the server running the WordPress site.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive files containing configuration data like database credentials, leading to potential database compromise and other security issues.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Depending on server configurations and the files that are included through LFI, an attacker can potentially gain arbitrary code execution on the server, leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through manipulating the plugin's functionality to include a file path that the plugin is not supposed to access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have the role of at least a contributor on the WordPress site.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is considered low priority by the reporting source
*   No official patch is available, and the reporting source offers virtual patching as a mitigation.
*   The CVSS score is 7.5
