## Description

Summary

When loading an (untrusted) XML document, for example the SAMLResponse, it's possible to induce an XXE.

$options is defined as:

[saml2/src/SAML2/DOMDocumentFactory.php](https://github.com/simplesamlphp/saml2/blob/717c0adc4877ebd58428637e5626345e59fa0109/src/SAML2/DOMDocumentFactory.php#L41)

Line 41
in
[717c0ad](/simplesamlphp/saml2/commit/717c0adc4877ebd58428637e5626345e59fa0109)

|  | $options = LIBXML\_DTDLOAD | LIBXML\_DTDATTR | LIBXML\_NONET | LIBXML\_PARSEHUGE; |
| --- | --- |

including the DTDLoad option, which allows an attacker to read file contents from local file system OR internal network.

While there is the NONET option, an attacker can simply bypass if by using PHP filters:

php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=<http://URL> OR FILE

From there an attacker can induce network connections and steal the targeted file OOB (haven't fully tested this).

RCE may be possible with the php://expect or php://phar wrappers, but this hasn't been tested.

Note:

The mitigation here:

[saml2/src/SAML2/DOMDocumentFactory.php](https://github.com/simplesamlphp/saml2/blob/717c0adc4877ebd58428637e5626345e59fa0109/src/SAML2/DOMDocumentFactory.php#L63-L69)

Lines 63 to 69
in
[717c0ad](/simplesamlphp/saml2/commit/717c0adc4877ebd58428637e5626345e59fa0109)

|  | foreach ($domDocument->childNodes as $child) { |
| --- | --- |
|  | if ($child->nodeType === XML\_DOCUMENT\_TYPE\_NODE) { |
|  | throw new RuntimeException( |
|  | 'Dangerous XML detected, DOCTYPE nodes are not allowed in the XML body' |
|  | ); |
|  | } |
|  | } |

Comes too late, as the XML has already been loaded into a document.

Mitigation:

Remove the LIBXML\_DTDLOAD | LIBXML\_DTDATTR options.

Additionally, as a defense in depth measure, check if there is the string: <!DOCTYPE inside the XML before parsing it. (This is not a complete fix because someone may be able to exploit some parser differentials, to load a DOCTYPE, maybe through spacing like: <! DOCTYPE)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
