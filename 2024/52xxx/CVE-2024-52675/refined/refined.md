Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the described SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the direct insertion of user-controlled input (specifically the `gid` parameter from the GET request) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where an attacker can manipulate the SQL query to perform unauthorized actions or access sensitive data.
* **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or escape user-provided input before using it in an SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Database Information Disclosure:** The provided payload demonstrates an attacker's ability to extract database information (e.g., database name) using SQL injection.
* **Data Modification:** An attacker could potentially modify data within the database, insert malicious data, or delete data.
* **Authentication Bypass:** Depending on the application's logic, an attacker could potentially bypass authentication mechanisms.
* **Complete Server Compromise**: An attacker could potentially gain full control of the server, depending on the database privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request where the `gid` parameter contains SQL injection code.
* **URL Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the URL by adding malicious SQL code within the `gid` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
* **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to construct and send HTTP GET requests.
* **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have a basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft malicious queries.

**Technical Details:**
* **Vulnerable File:** `msrps/movies.php`
* **Vulnerable Parameter:** `gid`
* **Injection Point:** Inside the SQL query where the `gid` value is used in a `LIKE` clause:
   ```sql
   where CONCAT('|',REPLACE(`genres`,',','|,|'),'|') LIKE '%|{$_GET['gid']}|%'
   ```
* **Exploitation Example:**
   `GET /msrps/?page=movies&genre=Fantasy&gid=-13' union select 1,database(),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13--+`
* **Database:** `msrps_db` (as inferred from the content)
