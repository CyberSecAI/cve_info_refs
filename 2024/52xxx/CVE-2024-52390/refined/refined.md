- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The CYAN Backup WordPress plugin (versions <= 2.5.3) is vulnerable to an arbitrary file download.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin has a flaw that allows a malicious actor to download arbitrary files from the website. This constitutes a broken access control vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could download any file from the website, including files containing login credentials or backup files. This could lead to a full compromise of the site.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is likely exploited through a direct web request that bypasses access controls.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be able to make web requests to the affected WordPress site. The page notes that an administrator privilege is required for exploitation, which suggests this may be a privilege escalation from a lower privileged user, or an admin user performing malicious actions.
