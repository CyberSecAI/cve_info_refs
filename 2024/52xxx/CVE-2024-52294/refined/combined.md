# IDOR in subscription management allows unauthorized subscription modifications

Moderate

Dec 29, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<1.29.0

## Patched versions

1.29.0

## Description

### Summary

An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in the update\_subscription endpoint allows any authenticated user to manipulate other users' Stripe subscriptions by simply modifying the email parameter in the request.

### Details

The vulnerability exists in the subscription endpoint at `/api/subscription`. The endpoint uses an email parameter as a direct reference to user subscriptions without verifying object ownership. While authentication is required, there is no authorization check to verify if the authenticated user owns the referenced subscription.

Vulnerable code in `/api/subscription`:

```
@subscription_router.patch("")
@requires(["authenticated"])
async def update_subscription(request: Request, email: str, operation: str):
    # IDOR: email parameter directly references user subscriptions without ownership verification
    customers = stripe.Customer.list(email=email).auto_paging_iter()
    customer = next(customers, None)

    if operation == "cancel":
        # Any authenticated user can modify any subscription referenced by email
        customer_id = customer.id
        for subscription in stripe.Subscription.list(customer=customer_id):
            stripe.Subscription.modify(subscription.id, cancel_at_period_end=True)
```
### PoC

1. Create a customer account in stripe:

   * Customer A: `adventure8812@zeropath.com` (attacker)
2. Log in as any user.
3. Send this request:

```
PATCH /api/subscription?email=adventure8812@zeropath.com&operation=cancel HTTP/1.1
```

4. The subscription for Customer A is successfully set to cancel.

### Impact

High:

Revenue loss via mass cancellation of subscriptions.

Loss of customer trust by re-enabling subscriptions they had set to cancel.

### Resolution

This was fixed in the following commit which limited subscription update operations to the authenticated user: [47d3c8c](https://github.com/khoj-ai/khoj/commit/47d3c8c23597900af708bdc60aced3ae5d2064c1). Support for arbitrarily presenting an email for update has been deprecated.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
