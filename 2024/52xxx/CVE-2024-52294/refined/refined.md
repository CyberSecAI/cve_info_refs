Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-52294:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in the `/api/subscription` endpoint.
*   The `update_subscription` function uses an email parameter directly to reference user subscriptions without proper authorization checks. Specifically, the system does not verify if the authenticated user is the owner of the subscription being modified.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **IDOR:** The core vulnerability is the lack of ownership validation when modifying subscriptions, allowing any authenticated user to manipulate subscriptions of other users by supplying a different user's email.
*   **Insufficient Authorization:** While authentication is in place, there are no authorization checks to verify that the authenticated user has the right to manage the specified subscription.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Revenue Loss:** Attackers could cancel subscriptions of other users, leading to financial losses for the service provider.
*   **Customer Trust Loss:** Malicious modification of subscription status (e.g., re-enabling cancelled subscriptions) can erode customer trust.
*   **Unauthorized Subscription Modification:** Any authenticated user can arbitrarily modify subscription settings of other users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network via the API endpoint.
*   The attack vector involves a crafted HTTP PATCH request to `/api/subscription`
*   The attacker manipulates the `email` query parameter to specify the target user's subscription.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have a valid account on the application to be authenticated.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the API endpoint.
*   **Knowledge of Target Email:** The attacker needs to know the email of the user whose subscription they want to modify.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in commit [47d3c8c](https://github.com/khoj-ai/khoj/commit/47d3c8c23597900af708bdc60aced3ae5d2064c1) by removing the `email` parameter from the API endpoint, ensuring that subscription updates only affect the authenticated user's subscription.
*   The provided code snippet shows the vulnerable function `update_subscription` where the email is directly used to query and modify subscriptions.
*   The fix removes email as a query parameter, ensuring that the authenticated user's email is used to retrieve and modify their own subscription details.
*   The CVSS score is 4.3, which is considered a moderate severity.
*   The vulnerability is associated with CWE-639, "Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key."
*   The vulnerability was found by adventure8812 and r0path.
