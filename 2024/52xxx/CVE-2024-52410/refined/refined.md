**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a **PHP Object Injection vulnerability**.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary vulnerability is PHP Object Injection, which arises from the insecure handling of user-supplied data that can be unserialized into PHP objects.
- The specific location and mechanism of the injection are not provided in this document, but it's clear that the vulnerability exists in the Referrer Detector plugin.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow a malicious actor to execute arbitrary code.
- Other potential impacts include SQL injection, path traversal, and denial-of-service attacks, which depend on the availability of suitable Property-Oriented Programming (POP) chains within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
