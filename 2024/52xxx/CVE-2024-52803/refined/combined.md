# Llama Factory Remote OS Command Injection Vulnerability

High

[hiyouga](/hiyouga)
published
GHSA-hj3w-wrh4-44vp
Nov 21, 2024

## Package

pip

llamafactory
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<=0.9.0

## Patched versions

0.9.1

## Description

## Summary

A critical remote OS command injection vulnerability has been identified in the Llama Factory training process. This vulnerability arises from improper handling of user input, allowing malicious actors to execute arbitrary OS commands on the host system. The issue is caused by insecure usage of the `Popen` function with `shell=True`, coupled with unsanitized user input. Immediate remediation is required to mitigate the risk.

## Affected Version

Llama Factory versions **<=0.9.0** are affected by this vulnerability.

## Impact

Exploitation of this vulnerability allows attackers to:

1. Execute arbitrary OS commands on the server.
2. Potentially compromise sensitive data or escalate privileges.
3. Deploy malware or create persistent backdoors in the system.

This significantly increases the risk of data breaches and operational disruption.

## Root Cause

The vulnerability originates from the training process where the `output_dir` value, obtained from the user input, is injected into the popen function without any sanitization. Furthermore, popen is invoked in a unsafe way by enabling the interact shell (`shell=True`), leading to remote OS command injection vulnerability.

Vulnerable snippet:

```
# https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/blob/bd639a137e6f46e1a0005cc91572f5f1ec894f74/src/llamafactory/webui/runner.py#L304-L323
def _launch(self, data: Dict["Component", Any], do_train: bool) -> Generator[Dict["Component", Any], None, None]:
				...
        args = self._parse_train_args(data) if do_train else self._parse_eval_args(data)
				...
        self.trainer = Popen(f"llamafactory-cli train {save_cmd(args)}", env=env, shell=True)
        yield from self.monitor()
```
## Proof of Concept (PoC)

### Steps to Reproduce

* Deploy llama factory
* Execute the exploitation script from: <https://gist.github.com/superboy-zjc/f2d2b93ae511c445ba97e144b70e534d>

  ```
  python3 llama-factory-rce.py --url http://127.0.0.1:7861 --cmd "curl XXX" --trace
  ```

Bad actors are able to execute any OS command as they want.

## Remediation Recommendations

**Avoid using `shell=True` in `Popen`.**

* Instead, pass the command and its arguments as a list. This prevents user inputs from being executed as part of a shell command.

```
cmd = [
    "llamafactory-cli",
    "train",
  	*save_cmd(args).split(),
]
self.trainer = Popen(cmd, env=env)
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
