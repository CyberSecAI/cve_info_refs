Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation and restrictions on file uploads to the `/api/v1/customer/profile-picture` endpoint. Specifically, the application does not validate the file extension or the `Content-Type` header, allowing the upload of arbitrary files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of restrictions on the types of files that can be uploaded.
*   **Missing File Extension Validation:** The application does not check the file extension to ensure it's an allowed type.
*   **Missing `Content-Type` Header Validation:** The application does not validate the `Content-Type` header to match the expected file type.
*   **Direct File Access/Execution:** Uploaded files can be accessed directly via a URL, leading to the server executing files that it shouldn't.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can upload and execute malicious server-side scripts (e.g., JSP, PHP, ASP), leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data:** Successful RCE can give attackers access to sensitive data stored on the server.
*   **Compromised Application Integrity and Availability:** The vulnerability can compromise the integrity and availability of the application.
*   **Full Server Compromise:** The vulnerability can lead to complete control over the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP PUT Request:** Attackers send a `PUT` request to the `/api/v1/customer/profile-picture` endpoint.
*   **Malicious File Upload:** The request includes a malicious file payload, such as a `.jsp`, `.php`, or `.html` file.
*   **Direct URL Access:** After upload, the attacker accesses the file directly via a URL obtained from a response, causing it to be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application.
*   **Valid Customer Role:** The attacker needs a valid customer account with role 26,17 as mentioned in the description.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable `/api/v1/customer/profile-picture` endpoint.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Payloads:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious file payloads, suitable for server-side execution.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes steps to reproduce the vulnerability, including a Burp Suite request screenshot showing the malicious file upload and a browser screenshot showing how to execute the file.
*   The content also includes a suggested fix, such as input validation, content inspection, directory restrictions and security headers.
*   The fix commit `204402b` introduces file type validation using `tika-core` library.
