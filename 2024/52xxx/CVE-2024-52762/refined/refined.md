The provided content describes two distinct Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in different versions of the `ganglia-web` project.

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of input sanitization for the `g` parameter in `graph_all_periods.php`.
*   **Vulnerability:**  Unrestricted parameters are passed to `graph_all_periods.php`, and the `g` parameter is vulnerable to XSS.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they visit a crafted URL.
*   **Attack Vector:**  A specially crafted URL is constructed with a malicious payload in the `g` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to entice a user to click the malicious URL.
*   **Affected Versions:** 3.73 <= Ganglia-web < 3.75

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of input sanitization for the `tz` parameter in `header.php`.
*   **Vulnerability:** The `tz` parameter in `header.php` is vulnerable to XSS due to lack of sanitization.
*   **Impact:** Similar to the first vulnerability, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser.
*   **Attack Vector:**  A specially crafted URL with a malicious payload in the `tz` parameter is used to trigger the XSS.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to entice a user to click the malicious URL.
*   **Affected Versions:** 3.73 <= Ganglia-web <= 3.76
