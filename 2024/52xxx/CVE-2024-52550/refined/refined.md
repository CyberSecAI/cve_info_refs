- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Pipeline: Groovy Plugin does not check if the main (Jenkinsfile) script for a rebuilt build is approved.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing script approval check when rebuilding a build.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can rebuild a previous build with a revoked (Jenkinsfile) script, potentially leading to the execution of malicious code that was previously disallowed.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to have Item/Build permission. The attack requires user interaction as the attacker needs to initiate the rebuild action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have Item/Build permission to initiate a rebuild on a project that had a revoked (Jenkinsfile) script. The attacker also needs to be able to trigger the rebuild by user interaction.
