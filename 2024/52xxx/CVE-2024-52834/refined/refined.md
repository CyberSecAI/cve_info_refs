This document provides details for multiple CVEs, including CVE-2024-52834.

**CVE-2024-52834**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS) due to improper input validation.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the system.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vectors**: Network based attack. The attacker would need to inject malicious code through a feature that allows user input. The injected code is then stored and executed when other users interact with the affected part of the application.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A low-privileged attacker can inject a malicious script. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
