Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**CVE-2024-52913** is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, the content does contain details regarding a recently disclosed vulnerability that was addressed in Bitcoin Core, but not assigned a CVE. This disclosure is titled "Disclosure of censorship due to transaction re-request handling"

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the "g_already_asked_for" mechanism, a limited-size map used to track `GETDATA` requests for transactions. This map has a bounded size (50000 entries), which can lead to the eviction of older entries when the map is full.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Limited Size of `g_already_asked_for` Map:** The bounded size of the `g_already_asked_for` map allows an attacker to force the eviction of specific transaction requests by flooding the map with bogus announcements.
- **Lack of Persistent Tracking:** The system relies solely on the `g_already_asked_for` map, without other mechanisms to ensure that requested transactions are eventually retrieved.
- **Re-Request Logic:** The vulnerability lies in how re-requesting transactions is handled. If a transaction is not found in `g_already_asked_for`, it's treated as a new announcement, triggering a new `GETDATA` request, even if an earlier request was already made.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Transaction Censorship:** An attacker can prevent a victim node from ever receiving a specific unconfirmed transaction. By continuously re-announcing the transaction and then not responding to the `GETDATA`, the attacker keeps the victim's node in a state of perpetual request for the same transaction. This effectively prevents the victim from seeing the transaction from other peers.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious Peer:** The attacker must be connected as a peer to the victim node.
- **Transaction Announcement:** The attacker initiates the attack by announcing a legitimate transaction to the victim node.
- **Bogus Announcements:** The attacker floods the victim node with bogus transaction announcements to evict the targeted transaction from `g_already_asked_for`.
- **Delayed Response:** The attacker delays responding to the `GETDATA` request for the legitimate transaction until after it is evicted from the `g_already_asked_for` map.
- **Repeated Re-Announcement:** The attacker re-announces the legitimate transaction, which causes the victim node to issue another `GETDATA` request, thus repeating the cycle.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be a peer on the Bitcoin network and connected to the victim node.
- **Transaction Relay:** The attacker must be able to announce transactions to the victim node.
- **Controlled Peer Behavior:** The attacker must be able to selectively respond to or ignore `GETDATA` requests.

**Additional details from the disclosure:**
- The vulnerability was responsibly disclosed by John Newbery, with the discovery credited to Amiti Uttarwar and him.
- The issue was fixed in Bitcoin Core version 0.21.0 (2021-01-14) via PR #19988.
-  The last vulnerable version (0.20.x) went End-Of-Life (EOL) on 2022-04-25.
- Public disclosure was made on 2024-07-03.
- This issue is considered to be of **Medium** severity.

This vulnerability is **related to transaction handling and network-level interaction in Bitcoin Core**, but it does not have a CVE assigned in the provided documentation. Since a CVE was requested, I will respond **NOINFO** rather than a non-explicitly related category.
