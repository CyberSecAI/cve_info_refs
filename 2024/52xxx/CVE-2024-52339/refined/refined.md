- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts, including redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads, that will be executed when guests visit the website.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious scripts through user-submitted data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to submit data through the front-end forms of the plugin. The privilege needed is "Contributor".
