## Package

Server
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

>= 28.0.0, >= 29.0.0, >= 30.0.0

## Patched versions

28.0.12, 29.0.9, 30.0.2

Server
(Nextcloud Enterprise)

>= 28.0.0, >= 29.0.0, >= 30.0.0

28.0.12, 29.0.9, 30.0.2

## Description

### Impact

Under certain conditions the password of a user was stored unencrypted in the session data. The session data is encrypted before being saved in the session storage (Redis or disk), but it would allow a malicious process that gains access to the memory of the PHP process, to get access to the cleartext password of the user.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 28.0.12, 29.0.9 or 30.0.2

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Enterprise Server is upgraded to 28.0.12, 29.0.9 or 30.0.2

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N
