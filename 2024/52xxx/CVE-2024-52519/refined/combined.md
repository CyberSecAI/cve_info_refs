Nov 15, 2024

## Package

Server
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

>= 28.0.0, >= 29.0.0

## Patched versions

28.0.10, 29.0.7

## Description

### Impact

The OAuth2 client secrets were stored in a recoverable way, so that an attacker that got access to a backup of the database and the Nextcloud config file, would be able to decrypt them.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 28.0.10 or 29.0.7

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Enterprise Server is upgraded to 27.1.11.8, 28.0.10 or 29.0.7

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Store the oauth2 secrets as hash instead of encrypting them. Then they can be validated but not recovered.

UI adjustment:

[![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/affef8e6-9162-4806-905b-c41412195c21)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/affef8e6-9162-4806-905b-c41412195c21)

* Show the eye button only if necessary
* Display a warning when a client is added (when a secret is actually displayed)

Sorry, something went wrong.
