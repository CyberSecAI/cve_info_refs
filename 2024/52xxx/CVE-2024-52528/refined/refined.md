- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The middleware in the application does not properly validate the authentication token.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper authentication token validation. The middleware returns a 200 OK status code even when a dummy or incorrect authentication token is provided.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass authentication and potentially access all endpoints of the application.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending requests with a dummy or invalid authentication token.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the affected endpoints with a fabricated or wrong auth token.
