- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Some APIs using `HttpRequestService` do not properly check the target host.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) due to insufficient validation of target host in `HttpRequestService` usage.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can send POST or GET requests to private IPs, potentially allowing them to access internal servers and perform further attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: Network. An attacker sends crafted requests to the vulnerable API endpoints.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs low privileges to exploit the vulnerability. No user interaction is required.
