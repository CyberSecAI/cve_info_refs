Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-52507:

**Vulnerability Description:**

The vulnerability is that the information about which Tables (identified by numeric IDs) are shared with which groups and users, including the respective permissions, was not restricted to only the affected users. This means a user could potentially learn about tables and their sharing configurations that they should not have access to.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is a lack of proper authorization checks within the Tables application, specifically when retrieving information about table shares. The application did not properly limit the visibility of sharing configurations to only users with the appropriate permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information about table sharing configurations.
*   **Insufficient Authorization:** The application lacked proper authorization checks to ensure users could only access share information for tables they were authorized to see.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers could potentially learn which users and groups have access to specific tables.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Knowledge of table sharing configurations could be leveraged to plan further attacks, although this is not explicitly detailed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely via the network as it involves accessing the application's API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges Required:** The attacker needs only low privileges in the Nextcloud instance.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The attacker needs to interact with the application, and this is not a purely passive attack.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 0.8.1 of the Nextcloud Tables app.
*   The fix was introduced through pull request #1406, which involved extending the usage of the Permission Middleware and replacing deprecated annotations with attributes.
*   The vulnerability is classified as having a "Low" severity score of 3.5 by CVSS v3.
*   The provided information is more descriptive than the typical CVE description, outlining the specific flaw and its resolution.
*   The fix was implemented by adding the `#[RequirePermission(permission: Application::PERMISSION_READ)]` attribute on the related methods which enforces the permission check before returning the data.
