# Custom defined credentials of external storages are sent back to the frontend

Moderate

[nickvergessen](/nickvergessen)

GHSA-42w6-r45m-9w9j
Nov 15, 2024

## Package

Server
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

>= 28.0.0, >= 29.0.0, >= 30.0.0

## Patched versions

28.0.12, 29.0.9, 30.0.2

Server
(Nextcloud Enterprise)

>= 25.0.0, >= 26.0.0, >= 27.0.0, >= 28.0.0, >= 29.0.0, >= 30.0.0

25.0.13.14, 26.0.13.10, 27.1.11.10, 28.0.12, 29.0.9, 30.0.2

## Description

### Impact

After setting up a user or administrator defined external storage with fixed credentials, the API returns them and adds them into the frontend again, allowing to read them in plain text when an attacker already has access to an active session of a user.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 28.0.12, 29.0.9 or 30.0.2

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Enterprise Server is upgraded to 25.0.13.14, 26.0.13.10, 27.1.11.10, 28.0.12, 29.0.9 or 30.0.2

### Workarounds

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

### CVE ID
