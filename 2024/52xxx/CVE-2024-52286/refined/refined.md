The provided content is related to CVE-2024-52286.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Merge functionality in Stirling-PDF takes user-provided file names and uses them directly in the creation of HTML pages without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input handling
- Lack of sanitization of user-supplied data
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user who uploads a malicious file. This can potentially lead to:
- Displaying of arbitrary HTML, including iframes, to change the look of the page.
- Displaying sensitive information, like session cookies.
- Potentially launching phishing attacks

**Attack vectors:**
- Uploading a file with a malicious filename containing HTML tags, such as `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>.pdf`.
- Navigating to the Merge PDF page and uploading the malicious file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to upload files to the Stirling-PDF application through the merge functionality.
- No authentication required.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `src/main/resources/static/js/merge.js` file, specifically at line 24.
- The fix involves using `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` when displaying the file name and creating elements using javascript and setting `textContent` for the file name and page counts to avoid any html injection.
- The provided proof of concept demonstrates the injection of JavaScript code and cookie access.
- The vulnerability is considered a self-injection style attack, meaning the attacker needs to trick the victim to upload a malicious file themselves.
