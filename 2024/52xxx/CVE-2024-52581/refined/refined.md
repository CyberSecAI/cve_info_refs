  "vulnerability_information": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2024-52581",
    "description": "Litestar offers multiple methods to return a parsed representation of the request body, as well as extractors that rely on those parsers to map request content to structured data types. Multiple of those parsers do not have size limits when reading the request body into memory, which allows an attacker to cause excessive memory consumption on the server by sending large requests.",
    "root_cause": "The `Request` methods to parse json, msgpack or form-data all read the entire request stream into memory via `await self.body()` without a prior size check or size limit.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-770"
    ],
    "impact": "A denial of service (DoS) vulnerability affecting all Litestar applications that process json, msgpack or form-data submission requests. Server memory consumption will increase very quickly until memory (and swap) are exhausted.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can send a large request with a matching content type to trigger the vulnerability.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists because the parsers for json, msgpack, and form-data read the entire request body into memory without any size limits. The multipart parser expects a single byte string as input and doesn't support incremental parsing. The `request_max_body_size` parameter was introduced to mitigate this vulnerability. When set, it will return a `413 - Request Entity Too Large` error if exceeded."
