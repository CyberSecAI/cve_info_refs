- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect object recycling and reuse in Apache Tomcat's JSP tag processing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper recycling of JSP tag objects, leading to potential information leakage or cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability could lead to XSS attacks, potentially enabling an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting malicious JSP pages that exploit the incorrect object recycling, an attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to deploy or influence the JSP pages processed by the vulnerable Tomcat instance. This usually involves having access to the web application's deployment files or being able to manipulate the JSP content through other vulnerabilities.
