Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-52520

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `LinkReferenceProvider` of Nextcloud. It relies on a HEAD request to determine the size of a linked resource before downloading it to extract open graph data. However, the HEAD request can be manipulated to report a small size, while the subsequent GET request returns a much larger file. This allows the provider to be tricked into downloading files larger than the intended limit.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate size check: The `LinkReferenceProvider` relies on the `Content-Length` header from a HEAD request which is not reliable.
- Lack of proper stream handling: The initial size check was done only on the HEAD request, not on the body of the GET request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can cause the Nextcloud server to download large files, potentially consuming excessive bandwidth and resources, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The attack is carried out over the network by providing manipulated links to the Nextcloud instance.
- The vulnerability is triggered when Nextcloud attempts to resolve a link for Open Graph data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide or control links that a Nextcloud user will interact with.
- The attacker needs to be able to host files on a server.
- The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests and headers.
- The attacker needs to provide a manipulated response to a HEAD request so that the GET request is initiated.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix implemented reads the response body as a stream and checks the size during the reading process to ensure that the limit isn't exceeded, rather than relying on the HEAD request.
- The fix also includes a timeout for the get request.
- The vulnerability has been assigned a "Moderate" severity with a CVSS score of 5.7
- The vulnerability is addressed in Nextcloud Server versions 28.0.10, 29.0.7 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions 27.1.11.8, 28.0.10, and 29.0.7.
- A workaround is to disable the `'reference_opengraph'` setting in the `config.php` file.
