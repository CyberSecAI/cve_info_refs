{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application allows uploading SVG files as profile pictures, and it does not sanitize or validate the content of these files. This allows an attacker to embed malicious JavaScript within the SVG file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of user-uploaded SVG files.",
      "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to session hijacking and privilege escalation, bypassing CSRF protections. An attacker could potentially steal session cookies and gain unauthorized access to user accounts.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the web interface of the application, specifically through the profile picture upload feature in the Create User functionality.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have the ability to access the Create User form, which is generally available to admin users. They need to be able to upload SVG files, which are not being properly validated. No user interaction is required to trigger the stored XSS."
  },
  "cve_id": "CVE-2024-52305"
