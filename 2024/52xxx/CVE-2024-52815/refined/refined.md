- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly validate invites received over federation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation of federated invites.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious server can send a specially crafted invite that disrupts the invited user's `/sync` functionality, effectively breaking the user's ability to synchronize.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, leveraging federation between matrix servers. A malicious server sends a crafted invite to a vulnerable Synapse server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to control a malicious federated Matrix server. They do not require any privileges on the target server. No user interaction is needed to trigger the vulnerability.
