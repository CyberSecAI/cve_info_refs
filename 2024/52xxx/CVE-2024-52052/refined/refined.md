Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2024-52052 and related CVEs:

**CVE-2024-52052 (RAPID7-WOWZA-WRITEJSP):**

*   **Root Cause:** This vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the `pushPublishMapPath` property when configured through the Wowza Streaming Engine Manager or REST API. This property is used to define the path for a mapping file which can then be used to redirect publishing streams.
*   **Weakness:**
    *   Lack of proper validation on the `pushPublishMapPath` value. Specifically, the system does not properly check if the provided file path:
        *   Is not empty.
        *   Has a TXT file extension
        *   Starts with the correct prefix (`VHostConfigHome`).
        *   Does not include a relative path
        *   Is not saved within the manager folder of the installation directory.
    *   This missing validation allows an attacker to control the file path, leading to remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** An authenticated administrator can define a malicious custom application property with a manipulated `pushPublishMapPath` value. This allows them to overwrite a TXT file which can then be used to redirect publishing streams to a malicious location and achieve high-privilege remote code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  An attacker needs to be an authenticated administrator.
    2.  The attacker uses the Wowza Streaming Engine Manager or the REST API to set a malicious `pushPublishMapPath` value in a custom application property.
    3.  The system writes the malicious configuration to a TXT file using the given path.
    4.  When a stream is published to the application, the system reads the malicious configuration file and redirects publishing to a malicious location, resulting in remote code execution.
*   **Required Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker must have administrative access to the Wowza Streaming Engine.

**CVE-2024-52053 (RAPID7-WOWZA-XSS):**

*   **Root Cause:** Inadequate sanitization of user-generated text in application logs.
*   **Weakness:** The application logs do not escape user-generated text before rendering it into HTML.
*   **Impact:** An unauthenticated attacker can inject client-side JavaScript into the administrator dashboard. When an administrator views the poisoned dashboard, the injected JavaScript executes, allowing the attacker to hijack the admin's session/account.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code via a method that gets logged and displayed on the administrator dashboard.
*   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker only needs to be able to generate logs. No authentication is required. The attacker also needs a user (admin) to view the poisoned dashboard.

**CVE-2024-52054 (RAPID7-WOWZA-TRAVERSAL-1):**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of validation on application names created via the REST API.
*   **Weakness:** The REST API does not prevent the creation of application names containing path traversal or special characters.
*   **Impact:** An authenticated administrator can create an XML file at an arbitrary location on the file system.
*  **Attack Vector:** An authenticated attacker crafts a request to the REST API to create an application with a malicious name containing path traversal.
*   **Required Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker must have administrative access to the Wowza Streaming Engine.

**CVE-2024-52055 (RAPID7-WOWZA-TRAVERSAL-2):**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of validation on source and destination application names when copying applications via the REST API.
*   **Weakness:** The REST API does not prevent the use of path traversal or special characters in source or destination application names when copying.
*   **Impact:** An authenticated administrator can read arbitrary files on the file system if the target directory contains an XML file.
*   **Attack Vector:** An authenticated attacker crafts a request to the REST API to copy an application with a malicious source or destination name containing path traversal.
*   **Required Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker must have administrative access to the Wowza Streaming Engine.

**CVE-2024-52056 (RAPID7-WOWZA-TRAVERSAL-3):**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of validation on application names when deleting applications via the REST API.
*   **Weakness:** The REST API does not prevent the use of path traversal or special characters in application names when deleting.
*   **Impact:** An authenticated administrator can delete any directory on the host system if the target directory contains an XML file.
*   **Attack Vector:** An authenticated attacker crafts a request to the REST API to delete an application with a malicious name containing path traversal.
*   **Required Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker must have administrative access to the Wowza Streaming Engine.

**Summary of fixes in Wowza Streaming Engine 4.9.1:**

*   Input validation was added to confirm that the `pushPublishMapPath` values for custom application settings are valid, specifically ensuring it has a TXT extension, and starts with a defined prefix, and is not in the manager folder.
*   Application logs now escape all text to prevent XSS.
*   REST API was updated to validate application names during creation, copy, and deletion to prevent path traversal.
* Spring Security was upgraded to version 6.2.7
* Read-only fields for Virtual Host Setup page were implemented in the Wowza Streaming Engine Manager and REST API
* SRT stream connection failure fixed due to null pointer exceptions when parsing description headers
* Removed netty-nio-client dependency to resolve AWS SDK API calls and Media Cache workflow issues
* Fixed 403 errors with HTTP Streamers Cupertino Settings in the Wowza Streaming Engine Manager
