Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-52301:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the Laravel framework handles environment variables when the `register_argc_argv` PHP directive is set to `on`. When this directive is enabled, user-supplied query string parameters can be manipulated to alter the environment variables used by the framework during request handling. This occurs because the framework was incorrectly parsing and using the command line arguments (`argv`) for environment detection even when not running from a command-line interface (CLI) environment

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of user-supplied input.
- Incorrect use of `argv` values when running in non-CLI SAPI environments.
- Environment variables can be manipulated using query strings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can change the environment variables used by the framework, potentially leading to unexpected behavior, information disclosure, or other security breaches.
- This could enable attackers to circumvent security controls.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited via crafted query strings in a URL.
- The `register_argc_argv` PHP directive must be set to `on` for the vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to a Laravel application with a vulnerable configuration.
- The attacker does not need any specific privileges or local access, making it a remote vulnerability.

**Additional Details**
- The fix ignores `argv` values when the application is running in non-CLI SAPIs (e.g., web server).
- The vulnerability affects Laravel versions before the patched releases.
- The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity.
