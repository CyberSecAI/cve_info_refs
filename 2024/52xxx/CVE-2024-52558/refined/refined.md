**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-191 Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound):** The software does not properly handle integer operations, which can result in the value wrapping around to an unexpected large value instead of becoming negative.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Denial of Service (DoS): Successful exploitation can lead to the program crashing.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Malicious HTTP Request: An unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted HTTP request containing a malformed query string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected device.
*   No Authentication Required: The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided text also details two other vulnerabilities: CVE-2024-48871 (Stack-based buffer overflow) and CVE-2024-52320 (OS command injection).
