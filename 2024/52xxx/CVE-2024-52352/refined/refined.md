- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Postcasa Shortcode plugin for WordPress, versions 1.0 and below, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin allows for the injection of malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful XSS attack allows a malicious actor to inject malicious scripts into a website, which are then executed when users visit the site. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as redirects to malicious sites, serving unwanted advertisements, and potentially other client-side attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the Postcasa Shortcode plugin, where malicious scripts can be injected.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts, which likely requires the ability to submit crafted shortcode input. The vulnerability requires at least a Contributor role.
