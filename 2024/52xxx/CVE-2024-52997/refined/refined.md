- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Use-After-Free (CWE-416)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A use-after-free vulnerability exists within Adobe Photoshop 2025.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The CVSS vector indicates local access (AV:L), low attack complexity (AC:L), no privileges required (PR:N), user interaction is required (UI:R), and the scope is unchanged (S:U), with high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability (C:H/I:H/A:H).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed, and requires a user to interact with a crafted file to trigger the vulnerability.
