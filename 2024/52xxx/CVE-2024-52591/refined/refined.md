- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing validation in `ApRequestService.signedGet` and `HttpRequestService.getActivityJson`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Insufficient input validation, allowing manipulation of data related to user profiles and notes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can create spoofed user profiles appearing to originate from a different instance, and forge notes that seem to be posted by different users. This enables impersonation, allowing the attacker to interact with the system as a fake user and post fabricated notes. The compromised Misskey instance will treat these spoofed objects as legitimate.
- **Attack vectors:** Network based attack, involving the manipulation of data via the API endpoints `ApRequestService.signedGet` and `HttpRequestService.getActivityJson`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No specific privileges, user interaction, or special deployment/execution conditions are required. The attacker only needs to send malicious requests over the network.
