# 1) Introduction

[Tuned](https://github.com/redhat-performance/tuned) is a privileged daemon for Linux that supports automatic
tuning of various hardware and kernel settings during runtime. The daemon
offers a comprehensive D-Bus interface protected by Polkit authentication. We
regularly perform reviews of newly introduced D-Bus system services and
changes to them. Tuned sees frequent additions to its D-Bus interface and this
is already the tenth review of it that we carried out since 2019. Usually the
reviews are straightforward and we have no complaints, but this time was the
exception.

During the review we checked the D-Bus methods matching the following Polkit
actions:

```
com.redhat.tuned.instance_create        (auth_admin:auth_admin:yes)
com.redhat.tuned.instance_destroy       (auth_admin:auth_admin:yes)
net.hadess.PowerProfiles.HoldProfile    (no:no:yes)
net.hadess.PowerProfiles.ReleaseProfile (no:no:yes)

```

This report is based on tuned release v2.24.0.

# 2) Problems in the `instance_create` D-Bus Method

Calling the `instance_create()` D-Bus method is allowed without
authentication for locally logged-in users (`yes` Polkit setting). The method
call accepts various parameters, including an `options` dictionary, that are
fully under attacker control.

## 2a) Script Options Allow Local Root Exploit (CVE-2024-52336)

The `script_pre` and `script_post` options allow to pass arbitrary scripts
that will be executed by *root*. The parameters are extracted in
[daemon/controller.py:459](https://github.com/redhat-performance/tuned/blob/v2.24.0/tuned/daemon/controller.py#L459), stored unmodified in a new
`Instance` object and the only verification of the script path is performed in
[plugins/base.py:222](https://github.com/redhat-performance/tuned/blob/v2.24.0/tuned/plugins/base.py#L222):

```
    if not script.startswith("/"):
        log.error("Relative paths cannot be used in script_pre or script_post. " \
                + "Use ${i:PROFILE_DIR}.")
        return False

```

So the only requirement is that an absolute path is passed. Thus, scripts
under control of an unprivileged user can be passed here. This allows for a
local root exploit.

### Reproducer

As a locally logged-in non-privileged user execute the following D-Bus call:

```
    $ gdbus call -y -d com.redhat.tuned -o /Tuned \
        -m com.redhat.tuned.control.instance_create cpu myinstance \
        '{"script_pre": "/path/to/myscript.sh", "devices": "*"}'

```

The path */path/to/myscript.sh* needs to be replaced by a path to a user
controlled executable script or program. It will be executed by tuned with
root privileges.

## 2b) Instance Name can Contain Arbitrary Data (CVE-2024-52337)

The `instance_name` parameter of the `instance_create()` method is not
sanitized. This string is later on used in logging and in the output of
utilities like `tuned-adm get_instances`, or other third party programs that
utilize tunedâs D-Bus interface to obtain instance names.

A local attacker can include arbitrary data in the instance name and can
achieve log spoofing this way. By placing newline characters into the name,
seemingly independent, legitimate-looking entries can be added to the tuned
log. By adding terminal control sequences the terminal emulators of
administrators or other users can be influenced. The following is a
Proof-of-Concept for this:

```
    $ EVIL=`echo -e "this is\nevil\033[?1047h"`
    $ gdbus call -y -d com.redhat.tuned -o /Tuned -m com.redhat.tuned.control.instance_create cpu "$EVIL" '{"devices": "*"}'

```

When another user now calls `tuned-adm get_instances` then the terminal emulator
will switch to the alternate screen upon output of the crafted instance name.

## Affectedness

The `instance_create()` D-Bus method has been added via upstream commit
[cddcd233](https://github.com/redhat-performance/tuned/commit/cddcd2336944a56e313324c699dd739fe8f1f85d) and was first part of version tag
v2.23.0. The initial version already contained support for the script option
parameters and the `instance_name` parameter.

# 3) Problems in the PowerProfiles Interface

## 3a) Cookie in PowerProfiles API is Predictable

The new D-Bus methods `HoldProfile()` and `ReleaseProfile()` use a cookie to
identify a profile hold. The cookie is simply a continuously increasing
integer starting at zero. This means other users in the system can easily
release the profile holds of other users.

## 3b) User Supplied Strings can Contain Arbitrary Data

The `HoldProfile()` call accepts `reason` and `app_id` strings which are used
in logging and may also be returned as a dictionary via
`ProfileHold.as_dict()`. These strings can again contain crafted data that
could have side effects similar to the ones shown in section 2b).

## Suggested Fix

A local DoS scenario using the `cookie` would only be an issue on multi-user
systems, or if the Polkit settings are relaxed so that also non-local sessions
can use these D-Bus methods. One way to make this more robust could be to hand
out random `cookie` IDs instead, to make the attack less trivial.

# 4) Bugfixes

Upstream published release [v2.24.1](https://github.com/redhat-performance/tuned/releases/tag/v2.24.1) that addresses the
issues described in this report. [Commit
90c24eea037](https://github.com/redhat-performance/tuned/commit/90c24eea037c7a5e9414c93f8fb3e549ed4a7b06) contains the cumulative fixes as follows:

* plugins are now only loaded from trusted locations (`_safe_script_path()`
  function).
* various user supplied strings are rejected if they contain disallowed
  characters (`is_valid_name()` function).
* upstream also tightened the tuned Polkit policy for `instance_create` and a
  number of other actions, that they also found to be problematic when
  accessed by local unprivileged users.

For issue 3a) no upstream fix is available at the moment. This is more of a
hardening suggestion, though.

Subject: tuned: local root exploit in D-Bus method instance_create and other
 issues in tuned >= 2.23 (CVE-2024-52336, CVE-2024-52337)

Hello list,

this is a report a about a local root exploit and some other issues in
tuned [1]. We also offer a rendered version of this report on our blog
[2].

1) Introduction
===============

Tuned is a privileged daemon for Linux that supports
automatic tuning of various hardware and kernel settings during runtime.
The daemon offers a comprehensive D-Bus interface protected by Polkit
authentication. We regularly perform reviews of newly introduced D-Bus
system services and changes to them. Tuned sees frequent additions to
its D-Bus interface and this is already the tenth review of it that we
carried out since 2019. Usually the reviews are straightforward and we
have no complaints, but this time was the exception.

During the review we checked the D-Bus methods matching the following
Polkit actions:

    com.redhat.tuned.instance_create        (auth_admin:auth_admin:yes)
    com.redhat.tuned.instance_destroy       (auth_admin:auth_admin:yes)
    net.hadess.PowerProfiles.HoldProfile    (no:no:yes)
    net.hadess.PowerProfiles.ReleaseProfile (no:no:yes)

This report is based on tuned release v2.24.0.

2) Problems in the `instance_create` D-Bus Method
=================================================

Calling the `instance_create()` D-Bus method is allowed without
authentication for locally logged-in users (`yes` Polkit setting). The
method call accepts various parameters, including an `options`
dictionary, that are fully under attacker control.

2a) Script Options Allow Local Root Exploit (CVE-2024-52336)
------------------------------------------------------------

The `script_pre` and `script_post` options allow to pass arbitrary
scripts that will be executed by _root_. The parameters are extracted in
daemon/controller.py:459 [3], stored unmodified in a new `Instance`
object and the only verification of the script path is performed in
plugins/base.py:222 [4]:

```
    if not script.startswith("/"):
        log.error("Relative paths cannot be used in script_pre or script_post. " \
                + "Use ${i:PROFILE_DIR}.")
        return False
```

So the only requirement is that an absolute path is passed. Thus,
scripts under control of an unprivileged user can be passed here. This
allows for a local root exploit.

### Reproducer

As a locally logged-in non-privileged user execute the following D-Bus
call:

```
    $ gdbus call -y -d com.redhat.tuned -o /Tuned \
        -m com.redhat.tuned.control.instance_create cpu myinstance \
        '{"script_pre": "/path/to/myscript.sh", "devices": "*"}'
```

The path _/path/to/myscript.sh_ needs to be replaced by a path to a user
controlled executable script or program. It will be executed by tuned
with root privileges.

2b) Instance Name can Contain Arbitrary Data (CVE-2024-52337)
-------------------------------------------------------------

The `instance_name` parameter of the `instance_create()` method is not
sanitized. This string is later on used in logging and in the output of
utilities like `tuned-adm get_instances`, or other third party programs
that utilize tuned's D-Bus interface to obtain instance names.

A local attacker can include arbitrary data in the instance name and can
achieve log spoofing this way. By placing newline characters into the
name, seemingly independent, legitimate-looking entries can be added to
the tuned log. By adding terminal control sequences the terminal
emulators of administrators or other users can be influenced. The
following is a Proof-of-Concept for this:

```
    $ EVIL=`echo -e "this is\nevil\033[?1047h"`
    $ gdbus call -y -d com.redhat.tuned -o /Tuned -m com.redhat.tuned.control.instance_create cpu "$EVIL" '{"devices": "*"}'
```

When another user now calls `tuned-adm get_instances` then the terminal
emulator will switch to the alternate screen upon output of the crafted
instance name.

Affectedness
------------

The `instance_create()` D-Bus method has been added via upstream commit
cddcd233 [5] and was first part of version tag v2.23.0. The initial
version already contained support for the script option parameters and
the `instance_name` parameter.

3) Problems in the PowerProfiles Interface
==========================================

3a) Cookie in PowerProfiles API is Predictable
----------------------------------------------

The new D-Bus methods `HoldProfile()` and `ReleaseProfile()` use a
cookie to identify a profile hold. The cookie is simply a continuously
increasing integer starting at zero. This means other users in the
system can easily release the profile holds of any other users.

3b) User Supplied Strings can Contain Arbitrary Data
----------------------------------------------------

The `HoldProfile()` call accepts `reason` and `app_id` strings which are
used in logging and may also be returned as a dictionary via
`ProfileHold.as_dict()`.  These strings can again contain crafted data
that could have side effects similar to the ones shown in section 2b).

Suggested Fix
-------------

A local DoS scenario using the `cookie` would only be an issue on
multi-user systems, or if the Polkit settings are relaxed so that also
non-local sessions can use these D-Bus methods. One way to make this
more robust could be to hand out random `cookie` IDs instead, to make
the attack less trivial.

4) Bugfixes
===========

Upstream published release v2.24.1 [6] that addresses the issues
described in this report. Commit 90c24eea037 [7] contains the cumulative
fixes as follows:

- plugins are now only loaded from trusted locations
  (`_safe_script_path()` function).
- various user supplied strings are rejected if they contain disallowed
  characters (`is_valid_name()` function).
- upstream also tightened the tuned Polkit policy for `instance_create`
  and a number of other actions, that they also found to be problematic
  when accessed by local unprivileged users.

For issue 3a) no upstream fix is available at the moment. This is more
of a hardening suggestion, though.

5) Timeline
===========

2024-11-07: We reported the issues to the Red Hat security team.
2024-11-08: Red Hat security confirmed the issues and communicated the
	    CVE assignments to us, and the publication date of
	    2024-11-26 was suggested.
2024-11-11: Red Hat shared the suggested patch and we reviewed it.
2024-11-26: The publication date has been reached and publication
            happened as planned.

This should be easily resolvable if the authors of tuned want to do so,
without needing to resort to relying on hard-to-predict cookie values.
Clients of the D-Bus system bus can identify other clients of the system
bus, by calling the GetConnectionCredentials method on the message bus
itself (this is how polkit works).

So, if tuned's design constraints allow a model where a cookie is only
considered valid to release if it was allocated by the same uid that
made the original request, that would be straightforward to implement.
Pseudocode:

    HoldProfile() -> cookie:
        get the caller's unique bus name (looks like e.g. :1.23)
        call GetConnectionCredentials(":1.23") to get the UnixUserID
        allocate a cookie
        store {cookie: uid} in a hash table
        return cookie

    ReleaseProfile(cookie):
        get the caller's unique bus name (looks like e.g. :1.23)
        call GetConnectionCredentials(":1.23") to get the UnixUserID

        look up the cookie's corresponding uid in the hash table

        if cookie not found || caller_uid != cookie_uid:
            error "No such cookie owned by this uid"

        ... continue to release the profile

Any good-quality D-Bus client library should have API to get the unique
bus name of the caller while handling an incoming method call. The most
commonly-used client libraries (dbus' libdbus, GLib's GDBus, systemd's
sd-bus) can certainly do that.

Treating each uid as a trust domain is the most common way to handle
system bus security, but on Linux, various other fields are conditionally
available in the result of GetConnectionCredentials if tuned wants to
implement some more complicated security model (for example looking at
the SELinux/AppArmor/Smack security label, which is available on D-Bus as
the LinuxSecurityLabel credential).

(Behind the scenes, this is implemented by the message bus using
SO_PEERCRED, SO_PEERSEC, etc. on each client connection, or the closest
available equivalent of SO_PEERCRED on various non-Linux OSs.)

Or, if the tuned authors want to implement a model where only the same
bus connection that initially called HoldProfile can call ReleaseProfile,
that's even simpler, because it doesn't need GetConnectionCredentials:
tuned could remember the unique bus name of the caller of HoldProfile,
and only allow ReleaseProfile to be called by a matching unique bus
name. If this is the chosen model, it will probably also want to watch for
NameOwnerChanged signals, so that it can automatically release the profile
when the requester disconnects from the message bus. In particular,
if the requester crashes, this disconnection will happen automatically
when the kernel cleans up its resources, which is not directly
security-relevant but seems likely to be desirable anyway.

This flaw allows an attacker to pass a controlled sequence of characters; newlines can be inserted into the log. Instead of the 'evil' the attacker could mimic a valid TuneD log line and trick the administrator. The quotes '' are usually used in TuneD logs citing raw user input, so there will always be the ' character ending the spoofed input, and the administrator can easily overlook this. This logged string is later used in logging and in the output of utilities, for example, `tuned-adm get\_instances` or other third-party programs that use Tuned's D-Bus interface for such operations. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2324541#c0)  OSIDB Bzimport    2024-11-08 13:07:06 UTC  ``` The `instance_name` parameter of the `instance_create()` method is not sanitized. This string is later on used in logging and in the output of utilities like `tuned-adm get_instances`, or other third party programs that utilize tuned's D-Bus interface to obtain instance names.  By adding control characters to the instance name, log spoofing can be achieved. By placing newline characters into the name, seemingly independent and legit log lines can be added to the tuned log. By adding terminal control sequences the terminal emulators of administrators or other users can be influenced   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2324541#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-26 15:34:43 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extended Lifecycle Support  Via RHSA-2024:10381 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10381](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A10381)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2324541#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-26 15:44:36 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2024:10384 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10384](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A10384)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=2324541#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-12-17 06:26:28 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2024:11161 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:11161](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A11161)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=2324541#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2025-01-09 14:49:35 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.8 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2025:0195 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:0195](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025%3A0195)   ``` |  |
