# Memory leak when middlewares are used

Moderate

[Dreamsorcerer](/Dreamsorcerer)
published
GHSA-27mf-ghqm-j3j8
Nov 18, 2024

## Package

pip

aiohttp
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>=3.10.6

## Patched versions

3.10.11

## Description

### Summary

A memory leak can occur when a request produces a `MatchInfoError`. This was caused by adding an entry to a cache on each request, due to the building of each `MatchInfoError` producing a unique cache entry.

### Impact

If the user is making use of any middlewares with `aiohttp.web` then it is advisable to upgrade immediately.

An attacker may be able to exhaust the memory resources of a server by sending a substantial number (100,000s to millions) of such requests.

Moderate
