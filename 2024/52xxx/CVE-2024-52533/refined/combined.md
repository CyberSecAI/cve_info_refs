Subject: CVE-2024-52533: Buffer overflow in socks proxy code in glib < 2.82.1

Another CVE was issued by Mitre yesterday for another bug listed on
  <https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Releng/security/-/wikis/home>

<https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/issues/3461> reports that:
"set_connect_msg() receives a buffer of size SOCKS4_CONN_MSG_LEN but it writes
  up to SOCKS4_CONN_MSG_LEN + 1 bytes to it. This is because SOCKS4_CONN_MSG_LEN
  doesn't account for the trailing nul character that set_connect_msg() appends
  after the hostname."

The fix was made by <https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/merge_requests/4281>
which was then backported to the glib-2.82.1 release made on Sep. 19.

<https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-52533> says that NVD has assigned
a CVSS score of 9.8, but <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-52533>
suggests a score of 7.0 instead.

# (CVE-2024-52533) Buffer overflow in set\_connect\_msg()

We have a complaint from a SAST tool (probably Coverity):

```
"Error: OVERRUN (CWE-119):
glib-2.79.1/gio/gsocks4aproxy.c:220: assignment: Assigning: ""len"" = ""set_connect_msg(msg, hostname, port, username, error)"". The value of ""len"" is now between 11 and 520 (inclusive).

```

Normally these are false positives, but in this case I think the tool is correct. `set_connect_msg()` receives a buffer of size `SOCKS4_CONN_MSG_LEN` but it writes up to `SOCKS4_CONN_MSG_LEN + 1` bytes to it. This is because `SOCKS4_CONN_MSG_LEN` doesn't account for the trailing nul character that `set_connect_msg()` appends after the hostname.

Fix should be:

```

I'm a little concerned because it looks like it was omitted from the size *intentionally*, as we see a very explicit diagram where the size of the trailing nul is not counted. But we do write it to the buffer, so surely the buffer needs to be large enough to accommodate it.
