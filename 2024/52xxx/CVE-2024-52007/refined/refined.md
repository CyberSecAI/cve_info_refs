```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insecure XSLT parsing, specifically the usage of `TransformerFactory` without proper configuration to prevent XML External Entity (XXE) injection. The `TransformerFactory` was being instantiated without disabling external DTDs or entities, making it vulnerable to XXE attacks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "XML External Entity (XXE) injection due to insecure use of `TransformerFactory`."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files from the host system, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information. By injecting a malicious DTD tag within an XML file, an attacker can force the server to include content from external sources.",
    "attack_vectors": "The primary attack vector is through the processing of user-submitted XML files containing a malicious DTD tag. An attacker can send a crafted XML file to the server where the org.hl7.fhir.core library processes it, leading to the disclosure of host system data.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to submit XML data to an endpoint that is processed by the vulnerable org.hl7.fhir.core library. This could be through a web service, API, or any application component that takes user-controlled XML input and uses XSLT transformations. No specific privileges or user interaction are required for the exploitation."
