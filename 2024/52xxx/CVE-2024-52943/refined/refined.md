{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled parameters in HTTP requests when viewing archived content within Veritas Enterprise Vault.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79). The application fails to neutralize input during web page generation, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject a parameter into an HTTP request, which will be reflected back to an authenticated user without sanitization if that user executes the crafted request. This can lead to the execution of malicious scripts in the user's browser within the context of the vulnerable web application.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects malicious code into a parameter within an HTTP request when viewing archived content.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Enterprise Vault system and needs to be able to craft HTTP requests. The attacker also needs the victim to trigger the malicious crafted link."
