Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-52297:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability was caused by the inclusion of all configuration properties within the `PublicConfigurationDTO`, which was publicly exposed to users. This exposed sensitive configuration details.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability was the exposure of sensitive configuration data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers could gain access to all configuration settings, potentially revealing sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, and other internal system details. This could lead to further attacks or unauthorized access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability was exposed through a public API endpoint, accessible over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No privileges required:** An attacker did not need any prior access or authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
- **No user interaction:** The attack could be carried out without any user interaction.
- **Remote access:** The attacker could exploit this vulnerability remotely, via the network.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code was introduced in pull request #2481 and fixed in pull request #2689.
- The affected version was v3.81.1 of the `tolgee/tolgee` docker image.
- The patched version is v3.81.2, and v3.81.1 was removed from both GitHub releases and DockerHub to mitigate the issue.
- The CVSS score is 9.8, indicating a critical severity. The CVSS vector string is `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`.
- The fix involved removing the redundant `isContentDeliveryEnabled` function and ensuring that only necessary public configuration data is exposed.
