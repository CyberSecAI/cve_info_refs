**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The WordPress Document & Data Automation plugin versions 1.6.1 and earlier are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to potentially force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force an authenticated user to perform unintended actions on the website. The specific impact varies but is generally classified as a broken access control issue.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a malicious website or link that tricks an authenticated user into unknowingly submitting a request to the vulnerable plugin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated user into visiting a malicious website or clicking a malicious link. The attacker does not need to be authenticated, but the victim must be. The attacker is external to the web application itself.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability has a low priority and CVSS score of 7.1, which is considered low within the context of CMS vulnerabilities
- A virtual patch is available from Patchstack to mitigate the issue until the plugin is updated to version 1.6.2.
- The vulnerability was reported by SOPROBRO.
