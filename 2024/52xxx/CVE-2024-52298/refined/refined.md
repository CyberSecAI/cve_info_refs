Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-52298

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the "Delegate my view right" feature in the PDF Viewer macro. This feature allows a user to view attachments if the last author of the page has access to the attachment, regardless of the viewer's own permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Access Control:** The system fails to properly enforce access control policies when rendering attachments within the PDF Viewer macro. It incorrectly delegates view rights based on the last author of a page, rather than the current user's permissions.
- **Information Disclosure:** The attachment URLs, including those of protected attachments, can be obtained from the Page Index and Attachments tab by inspecting HTTP requests. Even if the UI displays "N/A," the URL is included in the returned JSON data.
- **Bypass of View Restrictions:**  The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to bypass intended view restrictions on attachments by leveraging the "Delegate my view right" feature of the PDF Viewer macro.
- **WYSIWYG Editor Exploitation:** The HTMLConverter used by the WYSIWYG editor can be exploited to render the PDF Viewer macro, allowing access to attachments even without edit rights.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to confidential PDF attachments by exploiting the view delegation mechanism.
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can download protected attachments and expose sensitive information.
- **Potential Data Exposure:** Even if the file is not displayed properly in the browser, the attacker can still download the content through the browser's developer tools.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Macro Injection:** Attackers insert a PDF Viewer macro with "Delegate my view right" enabled into a page they can edit, referencing a protected attachment.
- **JavaScript Injection:** Attackers can use a JavaScript snippet in the browser's console to trigger the HTMLConverter and render the macro with a reference to a protected attachment, even without edit rights.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Basic User Account:**  The attacker only requires a basic user account with the ability to edit or access any page previously edited by a user with access to the target PDF attachment.
- **Access to Page Index and Attachments Tab:** The attacker needs to be able to access the Page Index and Attachments tab, and be able to inspect network requests from their browser.
- **Knowledge of Target Attachment Reference:** The attacker needs to know the attachment reference of the desired protected attachment, which can be found by inspecting the HTTP requests on the page.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability can be exploited even if the UI shows "N/A" for an attachment.
- The vulnerability allows accessing any file attachment, even if the attachment is not a PDF file, although it might not be rendered in the PDF viewer.
- The attacker needs to know the attachment reference and can get it by accessing the Page Index and Attachments tab and inspecting the HTTP requests.
- The vulnerability can be exploited without editing rights by injecting javascript to leverage the HTMLConverter.
- A workaround is provided, which involves deleting the `XWiki.PDFViewerService` document, which disables the view delegation, mitigating the vulnerability.
