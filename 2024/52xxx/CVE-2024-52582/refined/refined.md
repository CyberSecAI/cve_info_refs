Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2024-52582.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `typer` framework, used by `cachi2`, was configured to log local variables of functions when an unhandled exception occurred. This exposed sensitive information that might be present in the variables.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unintended disclosure of sensitive information.
- The logging of local variables by the `typer` framework during exceptions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Disclosure of secrets (e.g., passwords, API keys, tokens) if present in function parameters or local variables.
- Exposure of sensitive data in CI/CD pipelines if `cachi2` is used in such environments.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker may trigger an unhandled exception within `cachi2`.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the application is run and encounters an exception.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to execute `cachi2` and trigger an exception.
- No specific privileges are required, but some user interaction might be necessary.
- Attackers do not need to be in a privileged position.
- The attack vector is considered local, but the log files could be exfiltrated if they are sent to a remote logging server.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in `cachi2` version 0.14.0 and later by setting the `pretty_exceptions_show_locals` parameter to `False` in the `typer.Typer()` application initialization, preventing the logging of local variables during exceptions.
- The CVSS score is 4.7, categorized as "Moderate."
- The CWE associated with the vulnerability is CWE-497 (Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere).
