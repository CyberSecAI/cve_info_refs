This release fixes [CVE-2024-52796](https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher/security/advisories/GHSA-ffp2-8p2h-4m5j) where an attacker could spoof the `X-Forwarded-For` header to bypass the rate limiter.

If you are using an external proxy that is not on the local network, see [this documentation](https://docs.pwpush.com/docs/proxies/#trusted-proxies) on how to authorize the IP of your remote proxy.

  + [Proxy Headers: Alternative Option](#proxy-headers-alternative-option)

When hosting Password Pusher with a proxy, you can take advantage of the proxy‚Äôs features to enhance security, scalability, and performance. A proxy is often used to act as an SSL termination endpoint as well.

# Required Proxy Headers

An occasional issue is that when using Password Pusher behind a proxy, the generated secret URLs are incorrect. They often have the backend URL & port instead of the public fully qualified URL - or use HTTP instead of HTTPS (or all of the preceding).

To resolve this, make sure your proxy properly forwards the `X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Forwarded-Port` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` headers.

The values in these headers represent the front end request. When these headers are sent, Password Pusher can then build the correct URLs.

## Nginx Example

As an example, for nginx, the addition could be:

```
proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-Port $server_port;
proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-Host $host;
proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-Ssl on;

```
## Proxy Headers: Alternative Option

If you are unable to have these headers passed to the application for any reason, you could instead force an override of the base URL using the `PWP__OVERRIDE_BASE_URL` environment variable.

| Environment Variable | Description | Example Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PWP\_\_OVERRIDE\_BASE\_URL | Set this value (without a trailing slash) to force the base URL of generated links. | ‚Äòhttps://subdomain.domain.dev‚Äô |

# Trusted Proxies

By default, Password Pusher only trusts proxies on the local network. If your proxy is local, no additional configuration is required.

If you are using a remote proxy such as Cloudflare, an external F5 or other device that is not on the local network, you need to specifically authorize your proxy to Password Pusher for it to accept `X-Forwarded-*` proxy headers.

**Why Use Trusted Proxies?**

* This setting ensures that only requests from trusted proxies are allowed to forward headers like `X-Forwarded-For`.
* It provides an extra layer of security, preventing unauthorized or malicious actors from spoofing headers.

**How to Use Trusted Proxies**

1. Identify the IP addresses of your external proxies (e.g., Cloudflare or other remote reverse proxies).
2. Add those IP addresses to the `trusted_proxies` configuration in your environment or `settings.yml` configuration file.

## Configuration via settings.yml

Example Configuration in `settings.yml`:

```
trusted_proxies:
  - '1.2.3.4'
  - '2.3.4.5'

```
## Configuration via Environment Variable

If you prefer, you can set the trusted proxies directly through an environment variable:

```
PWP__TRUSTED_PROXIES='1.2.3.4'

__or__

PWP__TRUSTED_PROXIES='1.2.3.4,2.3.4.5'

```

# Rate limiter can be bypassed by forging proxy headers

Moderate

[pglombardo](/pglombardo)
published
GHSA-ffp2-8p2h-4m5j
Nov 20, 2024

## Package

Password Pusher Application

## Affected versions

< v1.49.0

## Patched versions

v1.49.0

## Description

### Impact

Password Pusher comes with a configurable rate limiter. In versions prior to [v1.49.0](https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher/releases/tag/v1.49.0), the rate limiter could be bypassed by forging proxy headers allowing bad actors to send unlimited traffic to the site potentially causing a denial of service.

Additionally, with the ability to bypass rate limiting, it also allows attackers to more easily execute brute force attacks.

### Patches

In [v1.49.0](https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher/releases/tag/v1.49.0), a fix was implemented to only authorize proxies on local IPs which resolves this issue.

If you are running a remote proxy, please see [this documentation](https://docs.pwpush.com/docs/proxies/#trusted-proxies) on how to authorize the IP address of your remote proxy.

### Workarounds

It is highly suggested to upgrade to at least [v1.49.0](https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher/releases/tag/v1.49.0) to mitigate this risk.

If for some reason you cannot immediately upgrade, the alternative is that you can add rules to your proxy and/or firewall to not accept external proxy headers such as `X-Forwarded-*` from clients.

### References

The new settings are [configurable to authorize remote proxies](https://docs.pwpush.com/docs/proxies/#trusted-proxies).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
