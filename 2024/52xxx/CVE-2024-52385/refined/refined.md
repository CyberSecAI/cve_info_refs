- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Team Member plugin (versions <= 7.4) is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin allows including local files of the target website without proper sanitization or validation, leading to Local File Inclusion.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially include sensitive files, such as those containing database credentials, which could lead to a complete database takeover. The output of included files is displayed on the screen.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through the plugin's functionality, which lacks proper access control.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker with "Editor" privileges in WordPress can exploit this vulnerability.
