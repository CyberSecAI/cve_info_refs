Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2024-52055:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an injection vulnerability in the Wowza Streaming Engine REST API. Specifically, when an administrator copies an application using the REST API, the source and destination application names are not properly validated. This lack of validation allows for path traversal or the inclusion of special characters in the application names.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the application name, potentially including path traversal sequences (`../`) or special characters. This could allow an attacker to access files and directories outside the intended scope of the application.
*   **File Read:** This specific vulnerability (CVE-2024-52055) allows an authenticated administrator to read any file on the file system if the target directory contains an XML file. This is achieved by manipulating the application name during the copy operation to access the targeted file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized File Access:** The primary impact is the ability for an administrator to read arbitrary files on the server's filesystem. This could expose sensitive data such as configuration files, credentials, or other confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is performed remotely using the Wowza Streaming Engine REST API.
*   **Authenticated:** Exploitation requires an attacker to have administrator privileges within the Wowza Streaming Engine environment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrator Access:** The attacker must be a legitimate administrator user with the ability to make API calls.
*   **REST API Access:** The attacker must be able to access the Wowza Streaming Engine REST API.
*   **Knowledge of Application Copy Functionality**: The attacker needs to be aware of the application copy functionality via the REST API.
*   **Knowledge of File Structure**: To successfully exploit the file read vulnerability, the attacker must know the location of target XML files on the server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is part of a group of vulnerabilities patched in Wowza Streaming Engine v4.9.1.
*   The vulnerability is rated with a CVSS score of 8.2, indicating a high severity.
*   The vulnerability was identified by Rapid7, who also coordinated the disclosure with Wowza.
*   This vulnerability is exploitable on both Linux and Windows installations of the Wowza Streaming Engine.

In summary, CVE-2024-52055 describes a vulnerability that enables an authenticated administrator to read arbitrary files on the server by exploiting a path traversal vulnerability when copying an application via the Wowza Streaming Engine REST API.
