# Unpatched `path-to-regexp` ReDoS in 0.1.x

Moderate

[blakeembrey](/blakeembrey)
published
GHSA-rhx6-c78j-4q9w
Dec 5, 2024

## Package

npm

path-to-regexp
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<0.1.12

## Patched versions

0.1.12

## Description

### Impact

The regular expression that is vulnerable to backtracking can be generated in the 0.1.x release of `path-to-regexp`, originally reported in [CVE-2024-45296](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9wv6-86v2-598j "CVE-2024-45296")

### Patches

Upgrade to 0.1.12.

### Workarounds

Avoid using two parameters within a single path segment, when the separator is not `.` (e.g. no `/:a-:b`). Alternatively, you can define the regex used for both parameters and ensure they do not overlap to allow backtracking.

### References

* [GHSA-9wv6-86v2-598j](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9wv6-86v2-598j "GHSA-9wv6-86v2-598j")
* <https://blakeembrey.com/posts/2024-09-web-redos/>

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-52798

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
