Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization or encoding of the `page_banner` parameter within the Piwigo configuration page. This allows a user to inject malicious script code into this parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The injected script is stored in the application's database and executed when a user views the Albums page, where the `page_banner` content is displayed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** The attacker can potentially access and steal sensitive information, including cookies, session tokens, and other data present in the user's browser.
*   **Compromise of Normal Functioning:** The attacker could manipulate the application's appearance or behavior, potentially leading to further attacks or disruption of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited via the web interface of Piwigo through the configuration page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Piwigo application with the ability to modify the configuration settings.
*   **Access to Configuration:** The attacker must have access to the configuration page within Piwigo to modify the `page_banner` parameter.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable parameter is `page_banner` in the Configuration page.
*   The malicious payload is injected using a POST request.
*   The injected script is triggered when users visit the Albums page.
*   The provided proof-of-concept payload is: `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`
