The content is related to CVE-2024-52592.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Missing validation in `ApInboxService.update`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation when updating poll results through the `ApInboxService.update` function. This allows external actors to modify poll results.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to modify the results of polls belonging to other users. Local polls are not affected, but remote polls on vulnerable Misskey instances can be manipulated. The integrity of poll results is compromised, which could lead to misinformation or skewed outcomes.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send a crafted update request to the vulnerable Misskey instance over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not require any specific privileges on the target instance to exploit the vulnerability. They need to be able to send network requests. The attack only requires a valid signature from any actor on any remote instance.
