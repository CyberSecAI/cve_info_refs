Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-52010:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2024-52010. The GitHub Security Advisory for GHSA-7hpf-g48v-hw3j explicitly states that it is associated with CVE-2024-52010, and describes a command injection vulnerability.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `CreateNewConnection` function within the `sshprox` module.
*   Specifically, the `username` variable, which is taken from user input, is not validated or sanitized before being used in the construction of an `ssh` command.
*   This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands by manipulating the username.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection (CWE-78):** The core vulnerability is the lack of input sanitization, allowing the injection of malicious commands into a shell execution context.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The `username` variable is not checked against any kind of safe pattern, allowing special characters and shell operators to pass through.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host running Zoraxy.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Because Zoraxy often runs as root (by default), this can result in full system compromise.
*   **Container Escape:** When Zoraxy is run in Docker with the Docker socket mounted, the attacker can escape the container and gain access to the Docker host.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The attack is performed through the web interface of Zoraxy.
*   **Web SSH Feature:** The specific feature targeted is the Web SSH terminal.
*   **HTTP Request:** The attack occurs through a crafted HTTP request to the `/api/tools/webssh` endpoint

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of Zoraxy, *unless* the application is run with the `-noauth` flag, in which case no authentication is required.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to access the Zoraxy web interface.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must know how to exploit the vulnerability (i.e., inject shell commands into the username field).

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   **Vulnerable Versions:** The vulnerability exists in Zoraxy versions 2.6.1 through 3.1.2.
*  **Patched Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.1.3.
*  **Introduction of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability was introduced in commit `c07d5f8`.
*  **PoC (Proof of Concept):** The provided proof-of-concept steps detail how an attacker would exploit this vulnerability, including a demonstration video.
*  **CVSS Metrics:** CVSS v4 base metrics are provided, giving a severity score of 8.6 (High), with an attack vector of Network, low complexity, no user interaction, and high privileges required.
*  **Mitigation:** The fix involves proper sanitization of the username field to prevent command injection.
