- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Adobe Substance 3D Sampler.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have some form of access to the system where the software is running. The user needs to be tricked into performing some action (User Interaction is required).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to interact with the software on the target system and trigger the overflow condition. This suggests that the attacker might need to convince a user to open a specially crafted file.
