- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper Input Validation (CWE-20).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly validate user-supplied input, which can lead to various security issues.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, requiring user interaction (UI:R). An attacker would likely need to craft a malicious file or input that triggers the vulnerability when opened by an unsuspecting user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker does not require any special privileges and can be a local user on the target machine, but they require the user to interact with the malicious input to trigger the vulnerability (user interaction).
