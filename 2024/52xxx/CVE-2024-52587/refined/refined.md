{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2024-52587",
      "root_cause": "The `execSync` function is used with shell interpretation enabled, and it incorporates values from environment variables, which can be manipulated by an attacker, leading to command injection.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Command Injection (CWE-78)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could inject arbitrary shell commands into the `execSync` calls, which would then be executed on the system. This could lead to a variety of malicious outcomes depending on the injected commands.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Manipulating environment variables such as `USER`, `RUNNER_TEMP` or other variables used in string interpolation within the `execSync` calls."
      ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to control environment variables before the vulnerable code executes, which is theoretically possible, though unlikely in the context of Github Actions, but still possible on self-hosted runners.",
        "locations":[
            {
             "file":"setup.ts",
             "lines":[169,229]
            },

            "lines":[40,41,42,43,44,53,57,61]
            }
         ],
        "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is present in `setup.ts` and `arc-runner.ts`. The `setup.ts` files uses `process.env.USER` in a command executed via `execSync`. The `arc-runner.ts` makes use of environment variables through `getRunnerTempDir()` function, which may be injectable due to its dependence on potentially attacker-controllable environment variables (e.g. `RUNNER_TEMP`)."
