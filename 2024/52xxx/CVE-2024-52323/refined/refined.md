- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A Sensitive Data Exposure vulnerability existed in Analytics Plus on-premise due to the presence of unused and vulnerable code. This allowed an authenticated user to retrieve sensitive tokens associated with the org-admin account.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Sensitive Data Exposure, specifically the ability to access org-admin tokens.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can obtain sensitive tokens, potentially leading to privilege escalation and allowing the attacker to perform admin actions such as adding or removing users and altering configurations.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by an authenticated user accessing the exposed tokens.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the affected Analytics Plus on-premise system.
