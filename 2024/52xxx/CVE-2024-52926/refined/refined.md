The provided document contains release notes for Delinea Privilege Manager, and mentions a security issue in older Windows agent versions.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The document mentions a security issue with Windows agent versions 12.0.2142 and older. The specific nature of the issue isn't detailed, but it is related to how elevation is performed which caused a regression. This resulted in Visual Studio Code and other applications which create child processes to malfunction if they were elevated via policy.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- A security vulnerability that affects how elevation is performed in older agent versions.
- The vulnerability causes a regression that can impact applications that create child processes when elevated through policy.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Applications like Visual Studio Code, which rely on creating child processes, may malfunction if elevated using a vulnerable version of the agent.
- The document states that older agent versions can render the system unusable if installed on Windows 11 version 24H2 or Windows Server 2025. Symptoms of the incompatibility include UAC failing to elevate programs that require admin rights.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is related to the Privilege Manager Windows agent itself, and how it handles elevation requests. An attacker would likely need to exploit the flawed elevation process.
- It's implied that simply running an affected application with the vulnerable agent installed will trigger the issue.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to have a vulnerable version of the Privilege Manager Windows agent installed on a machine where they want to cause the malfunction, along with the ability to trigger program elevation.
- It appears no direct control of the vulnerable application is required, simply elevation via policy.

**Additional notes:**
- The document provides a fix in agent version 12.0.2150 to resolve the security vulnerability.
- Version 12.0.2153 corrects the regression caused by the fix in 12.0.2150.
- There is an incompatibility issue of older agent versions with Windows 11 24H2 or Windows Server 2025 which will render the system unusable.
