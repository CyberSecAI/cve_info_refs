Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Arbitrary File Deletion

**Root Cause:** The `admin/file_manage_control.php` script in DedeV6.3.0 allows for arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient input sanitization and lack of proper access controls. Although there is a filter intended to prevent directory traversal, the current directory is the web root, and the full path to the target file can be provided directly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize the `filename` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify any file path within the web root.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The file management interface is accessible to authenticated users (with `DedeUserID=1` in the example), who have insufficient limitations on the files they can delete.
*   **Direct File Path Manipulation:** The file manager operates in the web root directory, and the filter can be bypassed by directly specifying the file path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** An attacker can delete any file within the web root, potentially leading to:
    *   **Website Defacement:** Deletion of essential website files can break site functionality or result in a defaced site.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Removing critical configuration or system files can render the website unusable.
    *   **Data Loss:** Important files or data can be irretrievably removed.
    *   **Compromised Installations**: Deleting files like install/install\_lock.txt can potentially allow re-installation of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** An attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to `admin/file_manage_control.php` with the `fmdo=del` action and the path of the file to be deleted via the `filename` parameter.
*   **Cookie Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the admin panel (valid cookies are required in the provided request example).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the DedeBIZ system with access to the admin panel (as a minimum, based on the provided cookies).
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable DedeBIZ instance.
*   **HTTP Request Knowledge:** The attacker needs to craft HTTP requests and must know the location of files to target.
