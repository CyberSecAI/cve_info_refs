# Layer 7 policy enforcement may not occur in policies with wildcarded port ranges

Moderate

[ferozsalam](/ferozsalam)
published
GHSA-xg58-75qf-9r67
Nov 25, 2024

## Package

Cilium

## Affected versions

>= 1.16.0, < 1.16.4

## Patched versions

1.16.4

## Description

### Impact

For users with the following configuration:

* An allow policy that selects a [Layer 3 identity](https://docs.cilium.io/en/v1.14/security/policy/language/#layer-3-examples) and a [port range](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/language/#example-port-ranges) **AND**
* A [Layer 7 allow policy](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/security/policy/language/#layer-7-examples) that selects a specific port within the first policy's range

then Layer 7 enforcement would not occur for the traffic selected by the Layer 7 policy.

This issue only affects users who use Cilium's port range functionality, which was introduced in Cilium v1.16.

For reference, an example of a pair of policies that would trigger this issue is:

```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: "layer-3-and-4"
spec:
  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: service
  ingress:
    - fromCIDR:
      - 192.168.60.0/24
      toPorts:
      - ports:
        - port: "80"
          endPort: 444
          protocol: TCP

```

and

```
apiVersion: "cilium.io/v2"
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: "layer-4-and-7"
spec:
  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: service
  ingress:
    toPorts:
    - ports:
      - port: "80"
        protocol: TCP
      rules:
        http:
        - method: "GET"
          path: "/public"

```

In the above example, requests would be permitted to all HTTP paths on matching endpoints, rather than just `GET` requests to the `/public` path as intended by the `layer-4-and-7` policy. In patched versions of Cilium, the `layer-4-and-7` rule would take precedence over the `layer-3-and-4` rule.

### Patches

This issue is patched in [#35150](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/35150).

This issue affects Cilium v1.16 between v1.16.0 and v1.16.3 inclusive.

This issue is patched in Cilium v1.16.4.

### Workarounds

Users with network policies that match the pattern described above can work around the issue by rewriting any policies that use port ranges to individually specify the ports permitted for traffic.

### Acknowledgements

The Cilium community has worked together with members of Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to [@jrajahalme](https://github.com/jrajahalme) for resolving this issue.

### @jrajahalme **[jrajahalme](/jrajahalme)** commented [Oct 1, 2024](#issue-2559110243) • edited Loading

Policy map key can have nexthdr and destination port fields wildcarded. Cilium datapath typically performs two policy map lookups, one with the L3 identity mapped from the relevant IP address (destination or source IP for egress or ingress policy, respectively). Datapath chooses between the two policy entries based on two booleans in the policy entry: 'wildcarded\_protocol' and 'wildcarded\_dport'. The problem is that 'wildcarded\_dport' is set only if the destination port is fully wildcarded, so partially wildcarded port is considered as "not wildcarded" for this logic.

Fix this for partially wildcarded ports by always choosing between L4-only and L3 policy matches by the key prefix length so that the most specific entry is always selected, selecting the entry with a specific identity if the prefix lengths are the same. That is, choose the policy with specific L3 if the prefixes are the same length, otherwise choose the policy with the longer prefix.

LPM map key already contains the prefix length, but unfortunately LPM map lookup does not return the map key. This is why we store an 8-bit version of the prefix length in the policy map entry, which is as follows:

0: both nexthdr and destination port fully wildcarded

8: nexthdr specified but port fully wildcarded

24: both nexthdr and destination port specified (no wildcarding)

Values between 8 and 24 represent the less or more wildcarded destination port.

Previously used wildcarded\_protocol and wildcarded\_dport flags are removed as redundant.

Before this change the precedence between the following two rules:

1. <ID>/TCP/80/15 -- L3 specified, TCP port 80 partially wildcarded (ports 80-81)
2. \*/TCP/80/16 -- L3 wildcarded, TCP port 80 not wildcarded

would have resulted in selecting the policy with <ID> specified even when it's destination port is partially wildcarded, while the L4-only rule has no wildcarding in it's destination port.

If the entries above were allow (1) and deny (3), Cilium agent masked this behavior by adding an additional deny entry in this case:

3. <ID>/TCP/80/16 -- L3 <ID> specified, TCP port 80 not wildcarded

This masks the incorrect behavior for allow/deny case, since the non-wildcarded key (3) is given precedence by the datapath.

There is no such additional entry logic in the allow/allow case, so if the more specific L4-only policy entry has L7 policy, and the less specific L3 policy not, then matching traffic would not be sent to the L7 proxy for policy enforcement.

After this change the policy with less L4 wildcarding (the more specific L4) is given precedence, with L3 rule being selected when prefixes are of the same length. This allows for simplifying policy map computation by avoiding the need to add additional entries in cases where deny already has the longer prefix length.

This change makes no difference for keys which only have the destination port fully specified or fully wildcarded, so this only affects policies with port ranges as enabled in Cilium 1.16.

Removal of the additional deny entries enabled by this change make `BenchmarkRegenerateCIDRDenyPolicyRules` ~10% faster due to reduced allocations.

Fixes: [#23885](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/23885)

```
Cilium datapath now gives precedence for the more specific allow rule with L7 rules when rules with port ranges are present.

```

Sorry, something went wrong.

| I don't feel like I fully get the idea, could you clarify please?  Before this change the precedence between the following two rules:   1. /TCP/80/15 -- L3 specified, TCP port 80 partially wildcarded (ports 80-81)  There is an unfortunate markdown rendering effect here, the source has "<ID>", which is rendered as an empty string. Note that the comment says "L3 specified".  2. \*/TCP/80/16 -- L3 wildcarded, TCP port 80 not wildcarded   would have resulted in selecting the policy with specified even when it's destination port is partially wildcarded, while the L4-only rule has no wildcarding in it's destination port.  Meaning that 1 is preferred over 2? Is that not expected according to the [comment](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/blob/8166d022cbd65ef702e58ef563a88efebe0885bb/bpf/lib/policy.h#L92-L99) in the code?  ``` * 2. ANY/proto/port (L4-only) * 3. id/proto/ANY   (L3-proto)  ```  1 is preferred over 2 due to this:  ```  	 * 1. id/proto/port  (L3/L4)  	 * 2. ANY/proto/port (L4-only)  ```  This happens because the condition used for 1. evaluates true due to `wildcarded_dport` being `true` only if it is fully wildcarded:  ```    if (likely(policy && !policy->wildcard_dport)) { 		*match_type = POLICY_MATCH_L3_L4;		/* 1. id/proto/port */   ```  After this change the policy with less L4 wildcarding (the more specific L4) is given precedence, with L3 rule being selected when prefixes are of the same length.  I.e. 2 will be preferred over 1? What's the motivation of this change?  Datapath only ever has to choose between two rules, one with full L3 identity match, other with L3 identity wildcarded (= 0). This change makes sure the policy with more specific proto/port is chosen out of these two. The lookup for these two cases is already doing that (among the matching L3 identity and wildcard L3 identity) due to the policy map being LPM. |

`[policy: Add test case verifying additional deny entries](/cilium/cilium/pull/35150/commits/9ae12ef1f2d68679cd060a9cc8c311f417da7584 "policy: Add test case verifying additional deny entries

Consider following two policy map state entries:

1. Allow <ID>/TCP/80/15 -- L3 <ID> specified, TCP port 80 partially wildcarded (ports 80-81)
2. Deny */TCP/80/16 -- L3 wildcarded, TCP port 80 not wildcarded

When the deny entry is added, Cilium adds an additional deny entry:

3. Deny <ID>/TCP/80/16 -- L3 <ID> specified, TCP port 80 not wildcarded

This makes sure that the allow rule is not given precedence. This is
currently needed due to the logic datapath uses to select between the
L3-specific and L4-only entries when both are found.

There is no such additional entry logic in the allow/allow case, so we
rely on the datapath choosing the \"right\" entry. Eg., if the more
specific L4-only policy entry has L7 policy, and the less specific L3
policy not, then the datapath should select the more specific entry and
redirect the traffic to the L7 proxy for policy enforcement.

`[bpf: Policy map precedence by LPM prefix length](/cilium/cilium/pull/35150/commits/6861644b30926ade3920fa75131000dd412490ae "bpf: Policy map precedence by LPM prefix length

Policy map key can have nexthdr and destination port fields
wildcarded. Cilium datapath typically performs two policy map lookups,
one with the L3 identity mapped from the relevant IP address (destination
or source IP for egress or ingress policy, respectively). Datapath
chooses between the two policy entries based on two booleans in the
policy entry: 'wildcarded_protocol' and 'wildcarded_dport'. The problem
is that 'wildcarded_dport' is set only if the destination port is fully
wildcarded, so partially wildcarded port is considered as \"not
wildcarded\" for this logic.

Fix this for partially wildcarded ports by always choosing between
L4-only and L3 policy matches by the key prefix length so that the most
specific entry is always selected, selecting the entry with a precific
identity if the prefix lengths are the same. That is, choose the policy
with specific L3 if the prefixes are the same length, otherwise choose
the policy with the longer prefix.

LPM map key already contains the prefix length, but unfortunately LPM map
lookup does not return the map key. This is why we store an 8-bit version
of the prefix length in the policy map entry, which is as follows:

0: both nexthdr and destination port fully wildcarded
8: nexthdr specified but port fully wildcarded
24: both nexthdr and destination port specified (no wildcarding)

Values between 8 and 24 represent the less or more wildcarded destination port.

Previously used wildcarded_protocol and wildcarded_dport flags are removed as redundant.

Before this change the precedence between the following two rules:

1. <ID>/TCP/80/15 -- L3 <ID> specified, TCP port 80 partially wildcarded (ports 80-81)
2. */TCP/80/16 -- L3 wildcarded, TCP port 80 not wildcarded

would have resulted in selecting the policy with <ID> specified even when
it's destination port is partially wildcarded, while the L4-only rule has
no wildcarding in it's destination port.

If the entries above were allow (1) and deny (3), Cilium agent masked
this behavior by adding an additional deny entry in this case:

3. <ID>/TCP/80/16 -- L3 <ID> specified, TCP port 80 not wildcarded

This masks the incorrect behavior for allow/deny case, since the
non-wildcarded key (3) is given precedence by the datapath.

There is no such additional entry logic in the allow/allow case, so if
the more specific L4-only policy entry has L7 policy, and the less
specific L3 policy not, then matching traffic would not be sent to the L7
proxy for policy enforcement.

After this change the policy with less L4 wildcarding (the more specific
L4) is given precedence, with L3 rule being selected when prefixes are of
the same length. This allows for simplifying policy map computation by
avoiding the need to add additional entries in cases where deny already
has the longer prefix length.

This change makes no difference for keys which only have the destination
port fully specified or fully wildcarded, so this only affects policies
with port ranges as enabled in Cilium 1.16.

| Marked `backport/author` due to significant differences between v1.16 and main (due to [#33719](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/33719) and [#33313](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/pull/33313) apparently). |

`[datapath: move policy map value prefix length to flags](/jrajahalme/cilium/commit/a56d346f8ceca55148e11f429ac2bf696f1298c3 "datapath: move policy map value prefix length to flags

Move the prefix length field in the policy map value to the flags (same
byte as 'deny') to a previously unused space. This cleans up padding
space for future use.

Skip map entries with inconsistent prefix length field in value vs. key
so that the entry will be rewritten with the correct prefix length field
in the value. This fixes a potential issue in upgrade where a policy map
entry may remain with zero valued prefix length in value leading to
incorrect policy enforcement.

Fixes: #35150
