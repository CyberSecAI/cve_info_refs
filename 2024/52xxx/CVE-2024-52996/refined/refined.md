The provided content is related to CVE-2024-52996.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Heap-based buffer overflow

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)

**Impact of Exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution

**Attack Vectors:** The CVSS vector string is `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`. This translates to:

*   **AV:L (Attack Vector: Local):**  The attacker needs local access to the system.
*   **AC:L (Attack Complexity: Low):** The attack is easily achieved.
*   **PR:N (Privileges Required: None):** No special privileges are required.
*   **UI:R (User Interaction: Required):**  User interaction is required for successful exploitation.
*   **S:U (Scope: Unchanged):** The vulnerability is limited to the vulnerable component.
*   **C:H (Confidentiality: High):** High impact on confidentiality.
*   **I:H (Integrity: High):** High impact on integrity.
*   **A:H (Availability: High):** High impact on availability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker requires local access to the system and user interaction is necessary for the exploitation to occur. No special privileges are required.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is present in Adobe Substance 3D Sampler versions 4.5.1 and earlier.
* The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" by Adobe.
* The provided advisory also covers CVE-2024-52994 and CVE-2024-52995 which also result in arbitrary code execution.
