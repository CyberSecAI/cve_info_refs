This document provides information about multiple vulnerabilities affecting Adobe Experience Manager (AEM).  CVE-2024-52837 is one of the vulnerabilities addressed in this security bulletin.

**CVE-2024-52837**

*   **Root Cause:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS). The vulnerability stems from improper handling of user-supplied input within the application leading to stored XSS.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79). The application stores malicious scripts within its database, and when that data is later displayed to a user, the script is executed in the user's browser.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed within the context of the victim's browser session, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or further compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can inject malicious script into the application through a vulnerable input point. This injected script is then stored and executed in the browsers of other users accessing the application.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to have low privileges and be able to interact with the application to inject the malicious script.  User interaction (victim must view the page with the stored XSS) is required for the exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The document lists multiple other CVEs, most of them also related to stored XSS.  
*   The document also identifies some Improper Authorization and Improper Access Control vulnerabilities.
*   The severity of CVE-2024-52837 is rated as "Important".
*   Adobe is not aware of any exploits in the wild for these vulnerabilities.
