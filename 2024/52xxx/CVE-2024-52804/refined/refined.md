{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a quadratic time complexity algorithm used in the parsing of HTTP cookies with escaped characters within the Tornado web framework.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption",
      "CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by sending maliciously crafted cookies to a vulnerable server. This leads to excessive CPU consumption, potentially blocking the event loop and preventing the server from processing other requests.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send HTTP requests with specially crafted cookie headers to the server.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires no special privileges or user interaction to trigger the vulnerability. They only need to be able to send HTTP requests to the server."
