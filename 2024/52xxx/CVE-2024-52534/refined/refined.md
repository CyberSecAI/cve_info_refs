Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-52534:

**Root Cause:** Authentication Bypass by Capture-Replay Vulnerability

**Vulnerability:** The Dell ECS versions prior to 3.8.1.3 are vulnerable to an authentication bypass. This means an attacker can potentially reuse captured authentication credentials to gain access. The vulnerability is a Capture-Replay issue, indicating that previously captured authentication data can be re-submitted to gain unauthorized access.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to session theft, allowing an attacker to impersonate a legitimate user and potentially access sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions within the system. This could lead to the unauthorized access of information and the ability to alter system configurations.

**Attack Vectors:** Remote access is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** A low-privileged attacker with remote access to the vulnerable system can perform a capture-replay attack.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The CVSS score is 5.4 with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N. This indicates a vulnerability with low privileges required, no user interaction, and a network attack vector with impacts that are limited to low confidentiality and integrity with no impact to availability.
*   The vulnerability is in Dell ECS, version(s) prior to ECS 3.8.1.3.
*   The recommended remediation is to upgrade to ECS version 3.8.1.3 or later.
