# Security[¬∂](#security "Permanent link")

Argo CD has undergone rigorous internal security reviews and penetration testing to satisfy [PCI
compliance](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org) requirements. The following are some security
topics and implementation details of Argo CD.

## Authentication[¬∂](#authentication "Permanent link")

Authentication to Argo CD API server is performed exclusively using [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io)
(JWTs). Username/password bearer tokens are not used for authentication. The JWT is obtained/managed
in one of the following ways:

1. For the local `admin` user, a username/password is exchanged for a JWT using the `/api/v1/session`
   endpoint. This token is signed & issued by the Argo CD API server itself and it expires after 24¬†hours
   (this token used not to expire, see [CVE-2021-26921](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-9h6w-j7w4-jr52)).
   When the admin password is updated, all existing admin JWT tokens are immediately revoked.
   The password is stored as a bcrypt hash in the [`argocd-secret`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/manifests/base/config/argocd-secret.yaml) Secret.
2. For Single Sign-On users, the user completes an OAuth2 login flow to the configured OIDC identity
   provider (either delegated through the bundled Dex provider, or directly to a self-managed OIDC
   provider). This JWT is signed & issued by the IDP, and expiration and revocation is handled by
   the provider. Dex tokens expire after 24 hours.
3. Automation tokens are generated for a project using the `/api/v1/projects/{project}/roles/{role}/token`
   endpoint, and are signed & issued by Argo CD. These tokens are limited in scope and privilege,
   and can only be used to manage application resources in the project which it belongs to. Project
   JWTs have a configurable expiration and can be immediately revoked by deleting the JWT reference
   ID from the project role.

## Authorization[¬∂](#authorization "Permanent link")

Authorization is performed by iterating the list of group membership in a user's JWT groups claims,
and comparing each group against the roles/rules in the [RBAC](../rbac/) policy. Any matched rule
permits access to the API request.

## TLS[¬∂](#tls "Permanent link")

All network communication is performed over TLS including service-to-service communication between
the three components (argocd-server, argocd-repo-server, argocd-application-controller). The Argo CD
API server can enforce the use of TLS 1.2 using the flag: `--tlsminversion 1.2`.
Communication with Redis is performed over plain HTTP by default. TLS can be setup with command line arguments.

## Git & Helm Repositories[¬∂](#git-helm-repositories "Permanent link")

Git and helm repositories are managed by a stand-alone service, called the repo-server. The
repo-server does not carry any Kubernetes privileges and does not store credentials to any services
(including git). The repo-server is responsible for cloning repositories which have been permitted
and trusted by Argo CD operators, and generating Kubernetes manifests at a given path in the
repository. For performance and bandwidth efficiency, the repo-server maintains local clones of
these repositories so that subsequent commits to the repository are efficiently downloaded.

There are security considerations when configuring git repositories that Argo CD is permitted to
deploy from. In short, gaining unauthorized write access to a git repository trusted by Argo CD
will have serious security implications outlined below.

### Unauthorized Deployments[¬∂](#unauthorized-deployments "Permanent link")

Since Argo CD deploys the Kubernetes resources defined in git, an attacker with access to a trusted
git repo would be able to affect the Kubernetes resources which are deployed. For example, an
attacker could update the deployment manifest deploy malicious container images to the environment,
or delete resources in git causing them to be pruned in the live environment.

### Tool command invocation[¬∂](#tool-command-invocation "Permanent link")

In addition to raw YAML, Argo CD natively supports two popular Kubernetes config management tools,
helm and kustomize. When rendering manifests, Argo CD executes these config management tools
(i.e. `helm template`, `kustomize build`) to generate the manifests. It is possible that an attacker
with write access to a trusted git repository may construct malicious helm charts or kustomizations
that attempt to read files out-of-tree. This includes adjacent git repos, as well as files on the
repo-server itself. Whether or not this is a risk to your organization depends on if the contents
in the git repos are sensitive in nature. By default, the repo-server itself does not contain
sensitive information, but might be configured with Config Management Plugins which do
(e.g. decryption keys). If such plugins are used, extreme care must be taken to ensure the
repository contents can be trusted at all times.

Optionally the built-in config management tools might be individually disabled.
If you know that your users will not need a certain config management tool, it's advisable
to disable that tool.
See [Tool Detection](../../user-guide/tool_detection/) for more information.

### Remote bases and helm chart dependencies[¬∂](#remote-bases-and-helm-chart-dependencies "Permanent link")

Argo CD's repository allow-list only restricts the initial repository which is cloned. However, both
kustomize and helm contain features to reference and follow *additional* repositories
(e.g. kustomize remote bases, helm chart dependencies), of which might not be in the repository
allow-list. Argo CD operators must understand that users with write access to trusted git
repositories could reference other remote git repositories containing Kubernetes resources not
easily searchable or auditable in the configured git repositories.

## Sensitive Information[¬∂](#sensitive-information "Permanent link")

### Secrets[¬∂](#secrets "Permanent link")

Argo CD never returns sensitive data from its API, and redacts all sensitive data in API payloads
and logs. This includes:

* cluster credentials
* Git credentials
* OAuth2 client secrets
* Kubernetes Secret values

### External Cluster Credentials[¬∂](#external-cluster-credentials "Permanent link")

To manage external clusters, Argo CD stores the credentials of the external cluster as a Kubernetes
Secret in the argocd namespace. This secret contains the K8s API bearer token associated with the
`argocd-manager` ServiceAccount created during `argocd cluster add`, along with connection options
to that API server (TLS configuration/certs, AWS role-arn, etc...).
The information is used to reconstruct a REST config and kubeconfig to the cluster used by Argo CD
services.

To rotate the bearer token used by Argo CD, the token can be deleted (e.g. using kubectl) which
causes Kubernetes to generate a new secret with a new bearer token. The new token can be re-inputted
to Argo CD by re-running `argocd cluster add`. Run the following commands against the **managed**
cluster:

```
# run using a kubeconfig for the externally managed cluster
kubectl delete secret argocd-manager-token-XXXXXX -n kube-system
argocd cluster add CONTEXTNAME

```

Note

Kubernetes 1.24 [stopped automatically creating tokens for Service Accounts](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md#no-really-you-must-read-this-before-you-upgrade).
[Starting in Argo CD 2.4](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/9546), `argocd cluster add` creates a
ServiceAccount *and* a non-expiring Service Account token Secret when adding 1.24 clusters. In the future, Argo CD
will [add support for the Kubernetes TokenRequest API](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/9610) to avoid
using long-lived tokens.

To revoke Argo CD's access to a managed cluster, delete the RBAC artifacts against the **managed**
cluster, and remove the cluster entry from Argo CD:

```
# run using a kubeconfig for the externally managed cluster
kubectl delete sa argocd-manager -n kube-system
kubectl delete clusterrole argocd-manager-role
kubectl delete clusterrolebinding argocd-manager-role-binding
argocd cluster rm https://your-kubernetes-cluster-addr

```

> NOTE: for AWS EKS clusters, the [get-token](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/eks/get-token.html) command
> is used to authenticate to the external cluster, which uses IAM roles in lieu of locally stored
> tokens, so token rotation is not needed, and revocation is handled through IAM.

## Cluster RBAC[¬∂](#cluster-rbac "Permanent link")

By default, Argo CD uses a [clusteradmin level role](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/manifests/base/application-controller-roles/argocd-application-controller-role.yaml)
in order to:

1. watch & operate on cluster state
2. deploy resources to the cluster

Although Argo CD requires cluster-wide ***read*** privileges to resources in the managed cluster to
function properly, it does not necessarily need full ***write*** privileges to the cluster. The
ClusterRole used by argocd-server and argocd-application-controller can be modified such
that write privileges are limited to only the namespaces and resources that you wish Argo CD to
manage.

To fine-tune privileges of externally managed clusters, edit the ClusterRole of the `argocd-manager-role`

```
# run using a kubeconfig for the externally managed cluster
kubectl edit clusterrole argocd-manager-role

```

To fine-tune privileges which Argo CD has against its own cluster (i.e. `https://kubernetes.default.svc`),
edit the following cluster roles where Argo CD is running in:

```
# run using a kubeconfig to the cluster Argo CD is running in
kubectl edit clusterrole argocd-server
kubectl edit clusterrole argocd-application-controller

```

Tip

If you want to deny Argo CD access to a kind of resource then add it as an [excluded resource](../declarative-setup/#resource-exclusion).

## Auditing[¬∂](#auditing "Permanent link")

As a GitOps deployment tool, the Git commit history provides a natural audit log of what changes
were made to application configuration, when they were made, and by whom. However, this audit log
only applies to what happened in Git and does not necessarily correlate one-to-one with events
that happen in a cluster. For example, User A could have made multiple commits to application
manifests, but User B could have just only synced those changes to the cluster sometime later.

To complement the Git revision history, Argo CD emits Kubernetes Events of application activity,
indicating the responsible actor when applicable. For example:

```
$ kubectl get events
LAST SEEN   FIRST SEEN   COUNT   NAME                         KIND          SUBOBJECT   TYPE      REASON               SOURCE                          MESSAGE
1m          1m           1       guestbook.157f7c5edd33aeac   Application               Normal    ResourceCreated      argocd-server                   admin created application

1m          1m           1       guestbook.157f7c60a55a81a8   Application               Normal    OperationCompleted   argocd-application-controller   Sync operation to 8a1cb4a02d3538e54907c827352f66f20c3d7b0d succeeded

```

These events can be then be persisted for longer periods of time using other tools as
[Event Exporter](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/k8s-stackdriver/tree/master/event-exporter) or
[Event Router](https://github.com/heptiolabs/eventrouter).

## WebHook Payloads[¬∂](#webhook-payloads "Permanent link")

Payloads from webhook events are considered untrusted. Argo CD only examines the payload to infer
the involved applications of the webhook event (e.g. which repo was modified), then refreshes
the related application for reconciliation. This refresh is the same refresh which occurs regularly
at three minute intervals, just fast-tracked by the webhook event.

## Logging[¬∂](#logging "Permanent link")

### Security field[¬∂](#security-field "Permanent link")

Security-related logs are tagged with a `security` field to make them easier to find, analyze, and report on.

| Level | Friendly Level | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Low | Unexceptional, non-malicious events | Successful access |
| 2 | Medium | Could indicate malicious events, but has a high likelihood of being user/system error | Access denied |
| 3 | High | Likely malicious events but one that had no side effects or was blocked | Out of bounds symlinks in repo |
| 4 | Critical | Any malicious or exploitable event that had a side effect | Secrets being left behind on the filesystem |
| 5 | Emergency | Unmistakably malicious events that should NEVER occur accidentally and indicates an active attack | Brute forcing of accounts |

Where applicable, a `CWE` field is also added specifying the [Common Weakness Enumeration](https://cwe.mitre.org/index.html) number.

Warning

Please be aware that not all security logs are comprehensively tagged yet and these examples are not necessarily implemented.

### API Logs[¬∂](#api-logs "Permanent link")

Argo CD logs payloads of most API requests except request that are considered sensitive, such as
`/cluster.ClusterService/Create`, `/session.SessionService/Create` etc. The full list of method
can be found in [server/server.go](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/abba8dddce8cd897ba23320e3715690f465b4a95/server/server.go#L516).

Argo CD does not log IP addresses of clients requesting API endpoints, since the API server is typically behind a proxy. Instead, it is recommended
to configure IP addresses logging in the proxy server that sits in front of the API server.

## ApplicationSets[¬∂](#applicationsets "Permanent link")

Argo CD's ApplicationSets feature has its own [security considerations](../applicationset/Security/). Be aware of those
issues before using ApplicationSets.

## Limiting Directory App Memory Usage[¬∂](#limiting-directory-app-memory-usage "Permanent link")

> > 2.2.10, 2.1.16, >2.3.5

Directory-type Applications (those whose source is raw JSON or YAML files) can consume significant
[repo-server](../architecture/#repository-server) memory, depending on the size and structure of the YAML files.

To avoid over-using memory in the repo-server (potentially causing a crash and denial of service), set the
`reposerver.max.combined.directory.manifests.size` config option in [argocd-cmd-params-cm](../argocd-cmd-params-cm.yaml).

This option limits the combined size of all JSON or YAML files in an individual app. Note that the in-memory
representation of a manifest may be as much as 300x the size of the manifest on disk. Also note that the limit is per
Application. If manifests are generated for multiple applications at once, memory usage will be higher.

**Example:**

Suppose your repo-server has a 10G memory limit, and you have ten Applications which use raw JSON or YAML files. To
calculate the max safe combined file size per Application, divide 10G by 300 \* 10 Apps (300 being the worst-case memory
growth factor for the manifests).

```
10G / 300 * 10 = 3M

```

So a reasonably safe configuration for this setup would be a 3M limit per app.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: argocd-cmd-params-cm
data:
  reposerver.max.combined.directory.manifests.size: '3M'

```

The 300x ratio assumes a maliciously-crafted manifest file. If you only want to protect against accidental excessive
memory use, it is probably safe to use a smaller ratio.

Keep in mind that if a malicious user can create additional Applications, they can increase the total memory usage.
Grant [App creation privileges](../rbac/) carefully.

# Git credentials are exposed in atlantis logs

GHSA-gppm-hq3p-h4rp

## Package

Atlantis

## Affected versions

<0.30.0

## Patched versions

0.30.0

## Description

### Summary

*Short summary of the problem. Make the impact and severity as clear as possible. For example: An unsafe deserialization vulnerability allows any unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code on the server.*

Atlantis logs contains GitHub credentials (tokens `ghs_...`) when they are rotated. This enables an attacker able to read these logs to impersonate Atlantis application and to perform actions on GitHub.

When Atlantis is used to administer a GitHub organization, this enables getting administration privileges on the organization.

This was reported in [#4060](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/4060) and fixed in [#4667](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/4667) . The fix was included in [Atlantis v0.30.0](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/releases/tag/v0.30.0).

### Details

*Give all details on the vulnerability. Pointing to the incriminated source code is very helpful for the maintainer.*

While auditing the Kubernetes/Argo CD/Atlantis deployment of some company, the following set-up was encountered:

* Most employees have read-only access to Argo CD, enabling them to see the health of deployed applications.
* Atlantis was deployed as an Argo CD application.
* Atlantis was used to manage the configuration of a GitHub organization (such as team members), using [Terraform's GitHub integration](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/integrations/github/latest).

Atlantis logs on Argo CD contained lines such as:

```
{"level":"debug","ts":"2024-11-07T17:58:30.636Z","caller":"vcs/gh_app_creds_rotator.go:58","msg":"Refreshing git tokens for Github App","json":{}}
{"level":"debug","ts":"2024-11-07T17:58:30.637Z","caller":"vcs/gh_app_creds_rotator.go:64","msg":"token ghs_[REDACTED]","json":{}}
{"level":"debug","ts":"2024-11-07T17:58:30.637Z","caller":"vcs/git_cred_writer.go:36","msg":"git credentials file has expected contents, not modifying","json":{}}
```

This enabled employees with read-only access to Argo CD to get administration privileges on the GitHub organization, compromising all repositories. As some repositories were used for Infrastructure-as-Code deployment (with Atlantis), this enabled the security auditors to get cluster admin privileges on most Kubernetes clusters.

While the set-up "most employees have read-only access to Argo CD" can be seen as dangerous, this should not incur such security risk (cf. <https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/security/>). The main issue here was that the logs contained privileged GitHub tokens as they were obtained by Atlantis.

This issue was already reported ([#4060](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/4060)) and fixed ([#4667](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/pull/4667)) but no security advisory was published on <https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/security> and no CVE was assigned (<https://app.opencve.io/cve/?&vendor=runatlantis&product=atlantis> only lists [CVE-2022-24912](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24912), which is unrelated).

Could you please publish a security advisory?

### PoC

*Complete instructions, including specific configuration details, to reproduce the vulnerability.*

cf. [#4060](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/4060) for more details.

### Impact

*What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?*

* This leaks sensitive GitHub tokens in the log files (CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File).
* This could enable anyone with log read access to compromiseGitHub organizations managed by Atlantis.
* This impact at least users using Atlantis with Github application and integration.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

Change the log line to prevent logging the GitHub App token in logs.

## why

* Resolves [Git credentials are exposed in atlantis logs ¬†#4060](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/issues/4060)
* Tokens should not be in the logs due to security implications

## tests

Confirmed Atlantis continues to successfully start.

Searching for pre-existing feature requests helps us consolidate datapoints for identical requirements into a single place, thank you! * Please do not leave "+1" or other comments that do not add relevant new information or questions, they generate extra noise for issue followers and do not help prioritize the request. * If you are interested in working on this issue or have submitted a pull request, please leave a comment.  ---  * I'd be willing to implement this feature ([contributing guide](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md))   **Describe the user story** Git credentials are exposed in atlantis logs (at least) when `--write-git-creds`. Even though there's a warning in atlantis documentation stating "This does write secrets to disk and should only be enabled in a secure environment.", i believe they shouldn't be exposed in the logs. I have provided below an excerpt of the log message and replaced my credentials with `actualcredentialshere`  ``` 1702650458045,"{""level"":""debug"",""ts"":""2023-12-15T14:27:38.045Z"",""caller"":""vcs/gh_app_creds_rotator.go:58"",""msg"":""Refreshing git tokens for Github App"",""json"":{}}" 1702650458045,"{""level"":""debug"",""ts"":""2023-12-15T14:27:38.045Z"",""caller"":""vcs/gh_app_creds_rotator.go:64"",""msg"":""token actualcredentialshere"",""json"":{}}" 1702650458052,"{""level"":""debug"",""ts"":""2023-12-15T14:27:38.052Z"",""caller"":""vcs/git_cred_writer.go:36"",""msg"":""git credentials file has expected contents, not modifying"",""json"":{}}"  ```  **Describe the solution you'd like** Git credentials are masked or ommited  **Describe the drawbacks of your solution** N/A  **Describe alternatives you've considered** N/A |
