**CVE-2024-52991**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:**  Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of user-supplied input leading to stored XSS.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  A low-privileged user needs to convince a victim to interact with a crafted payload.  The attacker needs to be able to store the malicious script on the server side, which is then rendered on the victim side, so there needs to be write permissions for the user to store the payload. User interaction is required.
