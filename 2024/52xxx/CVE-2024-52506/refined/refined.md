- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Concurrent PDF report rendering requests cause the reuse of a headless browser instance, which can lead to information leakage.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reusing a single headless browser instance for concurrent PDF report generation leads to data leakage between users. A race condition exists when checking the browser instance freshness.
- **Impact of exploitation**: One user may receive a report generated for another user, potentially exposing sensitive log messages or aggregated data they wouldn't normally have access to.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation requires sending multiple concurrent report rendering requests, as an authorized user, at the same start time.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attacker must be an authorized user within the Graylog environment capable of requesting reports.
