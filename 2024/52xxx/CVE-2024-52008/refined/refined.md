{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The user invite acceptance API endpoint lacks server-side password policy enforcement.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Client-side password complexity checks are bypassed by direct API calls to `/api/v1/user/accept-invite`, allowing users to set weak passwords.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An invited user can set a weak password (e.g., a single character), making the account easily compromised via guessing or brute-force attacks.",
  "Attack vectors": "Direct API calls to the `/api/v1/user/accept-invite` endpoint bypassing the client-side password validations.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an invited user with access to the invite link or be able to directly call the API endpoint."
