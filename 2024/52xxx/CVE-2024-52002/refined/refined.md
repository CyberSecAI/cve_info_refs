- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application lacks proper Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection on several pages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability, which allows an attacker to perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user without their knowledge or consent.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially perform any action that a legitimate user can do through the affected URLs, such as:
    - Creating, editing, or deleting objects (e.g., Incidents, UserRequests, People, Organizations)
    - Adding attachments
    - Applying stimuli
    - Modifying user settings
    - Running queries
    - Adding session messages
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to entice a logged-in user to visit a malicious page or link that triggers the CSRF attack. The user should be logged into the vulnerable application during the attack. It is also mentioned that low privileges are required, but not the user's privileges, so the attacker needs to have an account on the system.
