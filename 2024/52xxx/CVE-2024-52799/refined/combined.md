# Workflows: Excessive Privileges in Workflow Role

High

[tico24](/tico24)
published
GHSA-fgrf-2886-4q7m
Nov 21, 2024

## Package

https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm/argo-workflows
(Helm)

## Affected versions

appVersions >=3.4

## Patched versions

0.44.0

## Description

Important

This only affects the Helm Chart and not the upstream manifests

### Summary

The [`workflow-role`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/blob/2653aef414ab6a5d8617af75f04190a8f7da28dc/charts/argo-workflows/templates/controller/workflow-role.yaml) has excessive privileges, the worst being [`create` `pods/exec`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/blob/2653aef414ab6a5d8617af75f04190a8f7da28dc/charts/argo-workflows/templates/controller/workflow-role.yaml#L34), which will allow `kubectl exec` into any Pod in the same namespace, i.e. arbitrary code execution within those Pods. If a user can be made to run a malicious template, their whole namespace can be compromised.

This privilege [was used](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/12975/files#diff-d595f7190d1d43c9d2a43adb3fc16caa91985361045ff117dcb755855e166b8b) by the `k8sapi` Executor in older Argo Workflows versions <=3.3 when selected. In versions >=3.4, only the Emissary Executor is available, and it [does not use](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/release-3.5/workflow-rbac/) any forms of elevated privileges. See also a summary of the Executors in an older version of the docs: <https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/release-3.4/workflow-executors/>.

This was resolved by [#3044](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/pull/3044)

### Details

The `workflow-role` has excessive privileges:

#### `pods/exec` and `pods/log`

* [`pods/exec`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/blob/2653aef414ab6a5d8617af75f04190a8f7da28dc/charts/argo-workflows/templates/controller/workflow-role.yaml#L32) is not needed.
  + Upstream, [only the Controller](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/5aac5a8f61f4e8273d04509dffe7d80123ff67f5/manifests/cluster-install/workflow-controller-rbac/workflow-controller-clusterrole.yaml#L10) uses this when necessary to [enforce timely termination](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/5aac5a8f61f4e8273d04509dffe7d80123ff67f5/workflow/signal/signal.go#L19)
  + In Argo Workflows versions <=3.3, the `pods/exec` permission could be used by [the `k8sapi` Executor](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/12975/files#diff-d595f7190d1d43c9d2a43adb3fc16caa91985361045ff117dcb755855e166b8b). In versions >= 3.4, Emissary is the only Executor and it [does not use this privilege](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/release-3.5/workflow-rbac/).
* [`pods/log`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/blob/2653aef414ab6a5d8617af75f04190a8f7da28dc/charts/argo-workflows/templates/controller/workflow-role.yaml#L25) is not needed.
  + Upstream, [only the Server](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/5aac5a8f61f4e8273d04509dffe7d80123ff67f5/manifests/cluster-install/argo-server-rbac/argo-server-clusterole.yaml#L26) uses this to retrieve logs for workflow Pods for displaying via the API, CLI, UI.
  + In Argo Workflows versions <=3.3, the `pods/log` permission could be used by [the `k8sapi` Executor](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/12975/files#diff-d595f7190d1d43c9d2a43adb3fc16caa91985361045ff117dcb755855e166b8b). In versions >= 3.4, Emissary is the only Executor and it [does not use this privilege](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/release-3.5/workflow-rbac/).
* [`pods`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/blob/2653aef414ab6a5d8617af75f04190a8f7da28dc/charts/argo-workflows/templates/controller/workflow-role.yaml#L17) is not needed.
  + Upstream, [the Controller](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/5aac5a8f61f4e8273d04509dffe7d80123ff67f5/manifests/cluster-install/workflow-controller-rbac/workflow-controller-clusterrole.yaml#L9) and [the Server](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/5aac5a8f61f4e8273d04509dffe7d80123ff67f5/manifests/cluster-install/argo-server-rbac/argo-server-clusterole.yaml#L24) use this to manipulate child Pods
  + In Argo Workflows versions <=3.3, the Executor [would use](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/release-3.5/workflow-rbac/) `patch` and `get` `pods`. In versions >= 3.4 though, these permissions were replaced with `create` and `patch` `workflowtaskresults`. The upstream code could also fallback to `patch` `pod` with a deprecation warning, although the upstream manifests no longer included this. In >=3.6, the legacy fallback [will be removed](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/13100).
  + Only [the `k8sapi` Executor](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/12975/files#diff-d595f7190d1d43c9d2a43adb3fc16caa91985361045ff117dcb755855e166b8b) would use `watch`

### PoC

Install per [instructions](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/tree/8130224/charts/argo-workflows#installing-the-chart) with a [Workflow SA](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/tree/8130224/charts/argo-workflows#serviceaccount-for-workflow-spec):

```
helm repo add argo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm
helm install my-release argo/argo-workflows -f values.yaml

```

```
# values.yaml
workflow:
  serviceAccount:
    create: true
    name: "argo-workflow"
  rbac:
    create: true

```

Run Workflow that execs into the Controller

spec:
  entrypoint: controller-exec
  serviceAccountName: argo-workflow # Set ServiceAccount
  templates:
    - name: controller-exec
      container:
        image: bitnami/kubectl
        command: [ kubectl ]
        args:

```
### Impact

Anyone who uses the provided `workflow-role` may be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution from a malicious template.

The role is currently installed [by default](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/blob/2653aef414ab6a5d8617af75f04190a8f7da28dc/charts/argo-workflows/values.yaml#L71). Fortunately though, the attached SA is [*not* installed by default](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/blob/2653aef414ab6a5d8617af75f04190a8f7da28dc/charts/argo-workflows/values.yaml#L59) and would still have to be manually added as a `serviceAccountName` to a Workflow or template.

This affects versions of the `argo-workflows` Chart that use `appVersion: 3.4` and above, which no longer need these permissions for the only available Executor, Emissary. It could also affect users below 3.4 depending on their choice of Executor in those versions.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
