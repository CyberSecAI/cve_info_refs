{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vue-i18n library uses a message compiler to generate an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for locale messages. This AST contains special properties for performance optimization. If a third party can inject malicious code through prototype pollution, these special properties can be exploited to execute arbitrary JavaScript.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "XSS vulnerability due to prototype pollution",
      "Use of special properties in AST for performance that can be targeted"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code through locale messages, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": "A third party injects a malicious AST via locale messages to `createI18n` or `useI18n`. This could happen in development mode or if the user provides a custom AST. The prototype pollution is achieved by modifying the `Object.prototype` property.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to inject or modify the locale messages of the application and have knowledge about the AST structure used by vue-i18n. They need to have the ability to inject javascript via prototype pollution. This could happen if the developer loads a malicious locale message or if a supply chain attack injects a malicious dependency."
  },
  "fix": {
      "description": "The fix involves replacing object literals (`{}`) with `Object.create(null)` in several parts of the codebase to prevent prototype pollution. This change affects how objects are created within the library, ensuring that they don't inherit properties from `Object.prototype`, and prevents exploitation of the special properties in the AST. Additionally, several code changes were made to resolve the AST nodes properties.",
      "changes": [
        "Replaced object literals with `Object.create(null)`",
        "Modified code to resolve AST node properties safely."
