VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2024-52051

The affected devices do not properly sanitize user-controllable input when parsing user settings. This could allow an attacker to locally execute arbitrary commands in the host operating system with the privileges of the user.
