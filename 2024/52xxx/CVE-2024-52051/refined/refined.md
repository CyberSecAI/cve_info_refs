- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization of user-controllable input when parsing user settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Improper Input Validation (CWE-20) leads to a local arbitrary code execution vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the host operating system with the privileges of the user running the affected software.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the system and must be a low-privileged user. User interaction is required for the exploit to trigger.
