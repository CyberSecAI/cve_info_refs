The provided content is related to CVE-2024-52845.

**Root Cause:** The root cause of CVE-2024-52845 is a Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability is a stored XSS (Cross-site Scripting) issue. Input is not properly sanitized or validated, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are then stored and executed within the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in arbitrary code execution. An attacker could potentially gain control of the user's session or execute malicious actions within the context of the user.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. A low-privileged attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application which are later executed by other users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have low privileges on the affected system and must be able to inject malicious script into the application. User interaction is required as the stored script is executed when other users access the stored data.
