  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious actor can craft a request that, when triggered by a logged-in user with sufficient privileges, performs actions on the vulnerable site.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to entice a logged-in user with sufficient privileges to trigger a malicious request. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated."
