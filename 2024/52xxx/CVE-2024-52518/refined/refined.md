Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-52518:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the absence of password confirmation when modifying external storage settings in Nextcloud. This allows an attacker, having gained unauthorized session access, to manipulate these settings without requiring the user's password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Authentication Check:** The primary weakness is the failure to enforce password re-authentication for critical actions like creating, modifying, or deleting external storage configurations.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The vulnerability is exploitable if an attacker gains control of an authenticated user session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Storage Access/Manipulation**: An attacker with a compromised session can create, change or delete external storages, potentially leading to data exfiltration, data modification, or denial of service.
*   **Confidentiality Impact:** The attacker can gain access to data stored in external storage, leading to a high impact on confidentiality.
*   **Integrity Impact:** The attacker can potentially modify data on external storage, however the provided information indicates this is not a direct impact of this vulnerability.
*   **Availability Impact:** The attacker can delete external storages, causing a potential denial of service, however the provided information indicates this is not a direct impact of this vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is over the network, where the attacker does not need physical access to the server.
*   **Compromised Session:** The primary attack vector involves gaining unauthorized access to a valid user session. This could happen through various methods like session hijacking, phishing, or malware.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Nextcloud server over the network.
*   **Compromised User Session:** The attacker must obtain a valid session cookie or other session identifier to impersonate a legitimate user or administrator.
*   **High Privileges:** The attacker needs to have high privileges (i.e. admin user) to be able to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided GitHub content includes the pull requests that were created to fix the vulnerability by adding the PasswordConfirmationRequired to the user storages endpoint, external storages, and to saveGlobalCredentials method.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned a "Moderate" severity rating with a CVSS score of 4.4
*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Nextcloud server and Nextcloud enterprise server (>= 28.0.0, >= 29.0.0, >= 30.0.0) and is fixed in versions 28.0.12, 29.0.9 and 30.0.2.
