Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-52810:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a prototype pollution issue within the `deepCopy` function in the `@intlify/shared` library. This function recursively copies properties from a source object to a destination object. However, it fails to properly handle the `__proto__` property, which allows attackers to modify the prototype of JavaScript objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The core issue is the ability to inject properties into the prototype chain via the `__proto__` property within the source object passed to `deepCopy`.
- **Inadequate Input Validation:** The `deepCopy` function does not validate the keys being copied, allowing the injection of `__proto__`.
- **Recursive Copy:** The recursive nature of the `deepCopy` function means this vulnerability could occur at various depths of the object being copied if the malicious payload is nested

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The immediate impact of prototype pollution is the potential to cause DoS by modifying critical prototype properties.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE) Potential:**  If the polluted properties propagate to sensitive Node.js APIs (e.g., `exec`, `eval`), an attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution within the application's context.
- **Other Injection-based Attacks:** The vulnerability can potentially open doors to further attacks that rely on the behavior of polluted objects, depending on how the library is used within the application.
- **Data tampering:** Modifying the global prototype chain may change the behavior of the application, which may lead to data tampering.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input to deepCopy:** An attacker can craft a JSON payload containing a `__proto__` property (or nested within the payload) with attacker-controlled values and pass it as an argument to `deepCopy` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `deepCopy` function. This usually means that the attacker can influence data that is processed by the vulnerable application that utilizes the affected library
- They need to be able to provide a malicious object (usually via JSON string parsing) as the source argument to the vulnerable `deepCopy` function.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `node_modules/@intlify/shared/dist/shared.cjs:232:26`
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to exploit the `deepCopy` function using a crafted JSON payload.
- The fix involves changing how objects are created when performing the copy, using `Object.create(null)` instead of `{}` and adding a check to prevent copying `__proto__`.
- Patched versions: 9.14.2 and 10.0.5 for @intlify/shared, @intlify/vue-i18n-core and vue-i18n. 10.0.5 for petite-vue-i18n.
