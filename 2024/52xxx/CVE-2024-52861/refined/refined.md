The provided content is related to CVE-2024-52861.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper handling of user-supplied data that is stored and later displayed to other users.

**Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application, which will then be executed in the browsers of other users. This can lead to various impacts, including:
    - Stealing sensitive information (cookies, session tokens).
    - Defacing the website.
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:** Network. An attacker injects malicious code, typically JavaScript, via a form field, API, or other input mechanism that is not properly sanitized by the application. This injected code is then stored in the application's database. When another user requests and views this stored content, the malicious code is rendered in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application and store data.
   - The attacker needs to have the privilege to store content that will be viewed by other users. This typically means that the attacker has a low-privileged account.
   - The attacker's malicious code needs to be successfully stored by the application.
   - The victim needs to access the page containing the stored malicious code.
