- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing validation in `ApRequestService.signedGet`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The lack of proper validation allows attackers to create fake user profiles.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can create spoofed user profiles that appear to be from a different instance, allowing them to impersonate existing users, post, renote, and interact as a real account on the vulnerable instance.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker only requires network access; no special privileges or user interaction are needed.
