It seemed it was infected with malicious code, as it redirects to Leostop, I aint exactly sure, but file sends a GET request, that ultimatly fails, also it turns out the jquery I used was vulnerable to XSS, so thats good

# Leostop tracking spyware infested files

[DefinetlyNotAI](/DefinetlyNotAI)
published
GHSA-462m-5c66-4pmh
Nov 17, 2024

## Package

bootstrap.js
(Javascript Code)

## Affected versions

< 17/11/2024

## Patched versions

17/11/2024

jquery-3.4.1.min.js
(Javascript Code)

< 14/11/2024

## Description

### Impact

Any person who visited schedule.html (aka <https://weshack.me/Website/schedule>) before 17/11/2024 aka commit [93dfb83](https://github.com/DefinetlyNotAI/WesHacks/commit/93dfb83cb23a8d44e81dc12424ad8a5ea05e8f96)

Also jquery was affected, but remediated before 14/11/2024 aka commit [ea5a411](https://github.com/DefinetlyNotAI/WesHacks/commit/ea5a4112d94bfe47beb74b8a1ba9b631d10f64f0)

The vulnerability seems to be obscure, in short its a malicious injected JS file that occurs when bootstrap is run as well as jquery, it seems to be a tracking malware and creates 2 js file's - nothing else is clear.

### Patches

Been fixed, not version based

### Workarounds

No need, its a website

### References

Although [@iamthgeawsomboi2099](https://github.com/iamthgeawsomboi2099) is responsible for this due to failing to properly check code

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
