The WesHacks GitHub repository provides the official Hackathon competition website source code for the Muweilah Wesgreen Hackathon. The page `schedule.html` before 17 November 2024 or commit 93dfb83 contains links to `Leostop`, a site that hosts a malicious injected JavaScript file that occurs when bootstrap is run as well as jquery. `Leostop` may be a tracking malware and creates 2 JavaScript files, but little else is known about it. The WesHacks website remove all references to `Leostop` as of 17 November 2024.
