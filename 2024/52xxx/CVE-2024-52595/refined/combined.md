```
The `Cleaner()` now scans for hidden JavaScript code embedded
within CSS comments. In certain contexts, such as within `<svg>`
or `<math>` tags, `<style>` tags may lose their intended function,
allowing comments like `/* foo */` to potentially be executed by
the browser.

# HTML Cleaner allows crafted scripts in special contexts like svg or math to pass through

High

[frenzymadness](/frenzymadness)
published
GHSA-5jfw-gq64-q45f
Nov 19, 2024

## Package

pip

lxml-html-clean
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 0.4.0

## Patched versions

0.4.0

## Description

### Impact

The HTML Parser in lxml does not properly handle context-switching for special HTML tags such as `<svg>`, `<math>` and `<noscript>`. This behavior deviates from how web browsers parse and interpret such tags. Specifically, content in CSS comments is ignored by lxml\_html\_clean but may be interpreted differently by web browsers, enabling malicious scripts to bypass the cleaning process. This vulnerability could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, compromising the security of users relying on lxml\_html\_clean in default configuration for sanitizing untrusted HTML content.

### Patches

Users employing the HTML cleaner in a security-sensitive context should upgrade to lxml 0.4.0, which addresses this issue.

### Workarounds

As a temporary mitigation, users can configure lxml\_html\_clean with the following settings to prevent the exploitation of this vulnerability:

* `remove_tags`: Specify tags to remove - their content is moved to their parents' tags.
* `kill_tags`: Specify tags to be removed completely.
* `allow_tags`: Restrict the set of permissible tags, excluding context-switching tags like `<svg>`, `<math>` and `<noscript>`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @frenzymadness **[frenzymadness](/frenzymadness)** commented [Nov 12, 2024](#issue-2652030941)

The `Cleaner()` now scans for hidden JavaScript code embedded

within CSS comments. In certain contexts, such as within `<svg>`

or `<math>` tags, `<style>` tags may lose their intended function,

allowing comments like `/* foo */` to potentially be executed by

the browser.

Sorry, something went wrong.
