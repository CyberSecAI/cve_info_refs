# Missing dhcpv6\_opt\_t minimum header length check

High

[miri64](/miri64)
published
GHSA-xgv3-pcq6-qmrg
Nov 22, 2024

## Package

RIOT-OS
(RIOT-OS)

## Affected versions

<=2024.04

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Summary

In the function `_parse_advertise` in `/sys/net/application_layer/dhcpv6/client.c`, the absence of minimum header length check for `dhcpv6_opt_t` could result in an out-of-bound read during the `preparse` and `parse` phase.

### Details

In the function `_parse_advertise`, located in `/sys/net/application_layer/dhcpv6/client.c`, there is no minimum header length check for `dhcpv6_opt_t` after processing `dhcpv6_msg_t`. This omission could lead to an out-of-bound read, causing system inconsistency.

Additionally, the same lack of a header length check is present in the function `_preparse_advertise`, which is called by `_parse_advertise` before handling the request.

```
static int _preparse_advertise(uint8_t *adv, size_t len, uint8_t **buf)
{
    dhcpv6_opt_duid_t *cid = NULL, *sid = NULL;
    dhcpv6_opt_pref_t *pref = NULL;
    dhcpv6_opt_status_t *status = NULL;
    size_t orig_len = len;
    uint8_t pref_val = 0;

    DEBUG("DHCPv6 client: received ADVERTISE\n");
    if ((len < sizeof(dhcpv6_msg_t)) || !_is_tid((dhcpv6_msg_t *)adv)) {
        DEBUG("DHCPv6 client: packet too small or transaction ID wrong\n");
        return -1;
    }
    len -= sizeof(dhcpv6_msg_t);
    for (dhcpv6_opt_t *opt = (dhcpv6_opt_t *)(&adv[sizeof(dhcpv6_msg_t)]);
         len > 0; len -= _opt_len(opt), opt = _opt_next(opt)) {
        if (len > orig_len) {
            DEBUG("DHCPv6 client: ADVERTISE options overflow packet boundaries\n");
            return -1;
        }

        /* The absence of a size check for the remaining portion of opt */

        /* There should be also size check of remaining opt for each type */
        switch (byteorder_ntohs(opt->type)) {
            case DHCPV6_OPT_CID:
                cid = (dhcpv6_opt_duid_t *)opt;
                break;
            case DHCPV6_OPT_SID:
                sid = (dhcpv6_opt_duid_t *)opt;
                break;
            case DHCPV6_OPT_STATUS:
                status = (dhcpv6_opt_status_t *)opt;
                break;
            case DHCPV6_OPT_PREF:
                pref = (dhcpv6_opt_pref_t *)opt;
                break;
            default:
                break;

    ...
}

```
### Impact

The missing header length check in both `_parse_advertise` and `_preparse_advertise` can lead to out-of-bound reads, potentially causing system instability and inconsistency.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
