- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of the `url` parameter in the `forceUpgrade` page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Malicious script execution or redirection of the user to a different website.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript code within the `url` parameter and sends it as a GET request to the vulnerable `forceUpgrade` page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with JavaScript code, and to get the victim to click on it.
