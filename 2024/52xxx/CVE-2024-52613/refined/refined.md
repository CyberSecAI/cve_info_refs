{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a heap buffer under-read in the `movDemuxer.cpp` file due to a missing check for negative `track_id` values. This allows reading data in the negative direction of the `tracks` array.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap buffer under-read",
       "Missing input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "The heap buffer under-read can lead to a segmentation fault (SEGV) and program termination.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted `.mov` file that includes a negative `track_id` value in its metadata.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed `.mov` file to the `tsMuxeR` application, which parses it via `movDemuxer.cpp`. No specific position or privilege is required other than the ability to provide a file to be processed by the vulnerable program."
  },
    "affected_component": "movDemuxer.cpp",
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability was discovered during fuzzing. The fix for this issue was implemented by adding a check for negative `track_id` values and has been merged into the project's main branch."
