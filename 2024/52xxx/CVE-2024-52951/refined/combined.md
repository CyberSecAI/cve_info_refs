The web application Omada Identity suffered from a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability which allowed authenticated users to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the browsers of other users if they clicked on a malicious link.

## Vendor description

*"Omada Identity is a modern, enterprise-ready IGA solution that is deployed on-premises, giving you full control over your data and security. Our solution is easy to use, highly customizable, and gives you complete visibility into your environment without having to write a single line of code but is completely customizable to address any requirement. With built-in automation features, Omada Identity can help you streamline your workflows, improve efficiency, and strengthen your security posture."*

## Business recommendation

Upgrade to version v15U1 or install hotfix #309 for v14.14.

SEC Consult highly recommends to perform a thorough security review of the product conducted by security professionals to identify and resolve potential further security issues.

## Vulnerability overview/description

### 1) Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2024-52951)

An authenticated user can inject JavaScript in the "Request Reason". The injected JavaScript code will be executed if another user looks at the "History" of this access request. An attacker can then execute arbitrary JavaScript in the browser of other users which could for example be used for phishing attacks.

## Proof of concept

### 1) Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2024-52951)

An authenticated user can submit an access request and has to specify a reason why the access should be provided.

![](/fileadmin/user_upload/sec-consult/Dynamisch/Advisories/2024_11/sec-consult-c-omada-1-1_request_access.png)Figure 1: Submitting an access request with a JavaScript payload

This request has to be intercepted and modified, e.g.:

```
POST /workitemdlg.aspx?ACTTEMP=XXX&RURLID=YYY HTTP/1.1
Host: $SERVER
Cookie: oissessionid=$MYSESSION
[...]
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

[...]
1000104=Need+hello+access+and+bigfun<iframe+src=javascript:alert(document.domain)></iframe>&1000102=I+would+like+to+request+access+to+%5Bspecify+system%5D+so+I+can+perform+my+%5Bspecify+duties%5D+duties+related+to+my+work+as+a+%5Bspecify+position%5D.
[...]
```

Afterwards, anyone who reviews the "History" of this access request will be affected by the stored JavaScript code. Users who review the history requests are usually managers who have to approve this request, so this vulnerability allows reliably affecting higher-privileged users.

### Vulnerable / tested versions

The following version of the on-prem solution has been tested which was the latest version available at the time of the test:

* 14.0.14.36

Previous versions of v14.14 hotfix #309 are affected according to the vendor, as  well as <v15U1.

              title: Stored Cross-Site Scripting

=======================================================================

Vendor description:
-------------------
"Omada Identity is a modern, enterprise-ready IGA solution that is deployed
on-premises, giving you full control over your data and security. Our solution
is easy to use, highly customizable, and gives you complete visibility into your
environment without having to write a single line of code but is completely
customizable to address any requirement. With built-in automation features,
Omada Identity can help you streamline your workflows, improve efficiency, and
strengthen your security posture."

Source: <https://omadaidentity.com/products/omada-identity/>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
Upgrade to version v15U1 or install hotfix #309 for v14.14.

SEC Consult highly recommends to perform a thorough security review of the
product conducted by security professionals to identify and resolve potential
further security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2024-52951)
An authenticated user can inject JavaScript in the "Request Reason". The
injected JavaScript code will be executed if another user looks at the "History"
of this access request. An attacker can then execute arbitrary JavaScript
in the browser of other users which could for example be used for phishing attacks.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2024-52951)
An authenticated user can submit an access request and has to specify a reason why
the access should be provided.

<1-1_request_access.png>

This request has to be intercepted and modified, e.g.:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POST /workitemdlg.aspx?ACTTEMP=XXX&RURLID=YYY HTTP/1.1
Host: $SERVER
Cookie: oissessionid=$MYSESSION
[...]
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

[...]
1000104=Need+hello+access+and+bigfun<iframe+src=javascript:alert(document.domain)></iframe>&1000102=I+would+like+to+request+access+to+%5Bspecify+system%5D+so+I+can+perform+my+%5Bspecify+duties%5D+duties+related+to+my+work+as+a+%5Bspecify+position%5D.
[...]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Afterwards, anyone who reviews the "History" of this access request will be
affected by the stored JavaScript code. Users who review the history requests are
usually managers who have to approve this request, so this vulnerability allows
reliably affecting higher-privileged users.

<1-2_trigger_xss.png>

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following version of the on-prem solution has been tested which was the latest
version available at the time of the test:
* 14.0.14.36

Previous versions of v14.14 hotfix #309 are affected according to the vendor, as
well as <v15U1.
