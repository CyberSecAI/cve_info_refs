{
  "CVE-2024-52951": {
    "root_cause": "The web application Omada Identity suffers from a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization of the 'Request Reason' field.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the browser of other users, which could be used for phishing attacks or other malicious activities. This is particularly impactful as the vulnerable field is often reviewed by managers or other privileged users who approve access requests.",
    "attack_vectors": "An authenticated user injects malicious JavaScript into the 'Request Reason' field during the submission of an access request. When another user views the 'History' of that request, the injected script is executed in their browser.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Omada Identity application and be able to submit access requests. They also need to be able to intercept and modify the HTTP request to inject the malicious javascript."
