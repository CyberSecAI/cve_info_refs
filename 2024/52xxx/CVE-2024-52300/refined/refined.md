- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `width` parameter of the PDF viewer macro is not properly escaped, allowing for the injection of malicious HTML and JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization. The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-80.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to confidentiality breaches, integrity compromise, and availability issues potentially impacting the entire XWiki installation, especially if an administrator views the page with the malicious code.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, leveraging a maliciously crafted `width` parameter within the PDF viewer macro.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to edit a page in the XWiki system. User interaction is required, as the malicious code executes when a user views the page containing the exploit. The attacker requires low privileges (ability to edit) to introduce the exploit.
