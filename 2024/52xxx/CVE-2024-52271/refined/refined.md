          "root_cause": "The root cause is that the Documenso application does not flatten PDF layers before displaying the document for signing or before finalizing the signature. This allows malicious actors to create PDFs with hidden layers that can display different information when printed.",
          "weaknesses": "The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to flatten PDF layers, which allows for the misrepresentation of document content. The displayed version of the document does not show all layers and a user may be tricked to sign a document that contains malicious content if printed.",
          "impact": "The impact is content spoofing, where a user sees one version of the document in the signing interface, but a different version can be rendered when the document is downloaded and printed. This could lead users to sign documents without being aware of the full content, potentially leading to legal or other negative consequences.",
          "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves creating a malicious PDF with overlapping layers, where the displayed layer is benign, while hidden layers contain malicious content, and then using the Documenso platform to sign the document. The attacker needs to upload and sign the malicious PDF using the Documenso platform.",
