Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-52517:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that after storing "Global credentials" for external storage on the server, the API returns these credentials and adds them back to the frontend. This allows the credentials to be read in plain text.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Exposure of sensitive information (passwords) in plain text.
- Insecure handling of credentials by sending them to the frontend.
- Lack of proper masking or placeholder usage when returning credentials via API.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who has already gained access to an active user session can read the global credentials in plain text.
- This allows for potential unauthorized access to external storage systems linked to the Nextcloud instance.
- Compromise of external systems and data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to have an active session in Nextcloud to exploit the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the API returns the stored "Global credentials" for external storage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be logged into an active user session of Nextcloud.
- Access to the web browser and the Nextcloud frontend is required to intercept the credentials returned by the API.
- The attacker does not need any specific technical knowledge, besides being able to use the developer tools of the browser.

**Additional Notes**
- The fix implemented involved using a placeholder for the password when returning the credentials via the API.
- The vulnerability is assigned a CVSS score of 4.6, which is considered Moderate.
- The vulnerability was reported by Bundesamt f√ºr Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) and mgm-sp.
- Patched versions include Nextcloud Server 28.0.11, 29.0.8, 30.0.1 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions 25.0.13.13, 26.0.13.9, 27.1.11.9, 28.0.11, 29.0.8, and 30.0.1
