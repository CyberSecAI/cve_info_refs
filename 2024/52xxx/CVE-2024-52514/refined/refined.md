Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-52514:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability arises from insufficient access control enforcement during folder copying operations in Nextcloud. Specifically, when a user receives a share containing files that are blocked by the files access control mechanism, the user can still copy the intermediate folder containing those blocked files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Access Control Checks:** The system fails to properly check access control rules when copying a folder containing blocked files.
- **Bypass of File Access Control:**  By copying the intermediate folder, users can potentially gain access to files that they should not have access to based on the intended access control rules.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** A user who has received a share with some files blocked by access control can copy the folder containing those blocked files and potentially access those blocked files, leading to unauthorized data access.
- **Scope Change:** The vulnerability allows a user to bypass access controls that are supposed to restrict file access, thus impacting security beyond the intended scope of file sharing.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed over the network via the Nextcloud web interface or API.
- **User Interaction:** The user needs to interact with the system to initiate the copy operation.
- **Shared Files:** The attack requires a user to be a recipient of a share containing files that are blocked by the files access control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs to be a regular user who has received a share.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker has to be able to use the file copy function within Nextcloud.

**Additional details:**

- **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects Nextcloud Server versions 27.0.0 and later, and Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions 21.0.0 and later.
- **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in Nextcloud Server versions 27.1.9, 28.0.5, and 29.0.0, and in Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions 21.0.9.18, 22.2.10.23, 23.0.12.18, 24.0.12.14, 25.0.13.9, 26.0.13.3, 27.1.9, 28.0.5, and 29.0.0.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 4.1, with a vector of AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N.
