Server
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

>= 27.0.0, >= 28.0.0

## Patched versions

27.1.9, 28.0.5, 29.0.0

Server
(Nextcloud Enterprise)

>= 21.0.0, >= 22.0.0, >= 23.0.0, >= 24.0.0, >= 25.0.0, >= 26.0.0, >= 27.0.0, >= 28.0.0

## Description

### Impact

After a user received a share with some files inside being blocked by the files access control, the user would still be able to copy the intermediate folder inside Nextcloud allowing them to afterwards potentially access the blocked files depending on the user access control rules.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 27.1.9, 28.0.5 or 29.0.0

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N
