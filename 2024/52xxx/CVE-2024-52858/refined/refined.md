The provided document is a security bulletin from Adobe, detailing multiple vulnerabilities in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM). CVE-2024-52858 is one of the vulnerabilities addressed in this bulletin.

**CVE-2024-52858**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS). This indicates that user-provided input is not properly sanitized when stored, leading to the ability to inject malicious scripts.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), specifically CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation).
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript that will execute in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack vectors**: Network-based. The attacker would need to inject the malicious script into the application, and then a user would need to trigger the execution of the script by loading the vulnerable page.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A low-privileged attacker with access to the AEM application can inject malicious code, which will then affect other users who access the content. This requires user interaction to trigger the XSS, meaning an affected user has to view the compromised content.
