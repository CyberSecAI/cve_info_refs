# Workflows: Lack of Granularity in Workflow Role

Low

[tico24](/tico24)
published
GHSA-h974-w8pg-cx73
Nov 22, 2024

## Package

https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm/argo-workflows
(Helm)

## Affected versions

<0.45.0

## Patched versions

0.45.0

## Description

Important

This only affects the Helm Chart and not the upstream manifests

### Summary

The [`workflow-role`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/blob/2653aef414ab6a5d8617af75f04190a8f7da28dc/charts/argo-workflows/templates/controller/workflow-role.yaml) lacks granularity in its privileges, giving permissions to `workflowtasksets` and `workflowartifactgctasks` to all workflow Pods, when only certain types of Pods created by the Controller require these privileges.

The impact is minimal, as an attack could only affect status reporting for certain types of Pods and templates.

This was resolved by [#3048](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/pull/3048)

### Details

[Two sets](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/blob/2653aef414ab6a5d8617af75f04190a8f7da28dc/charts/argo-workflows/templates/controller/workflow-role.yaml#L45-L56) of permissions are only needed for certain types of Pods created by the Controller:

#### `workflowtasksets` and `workflowartifactgctasks`

* Only the Agent, which currently only runs for HTTP and Plugin Templates, [uses `workflowtasksets`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/5aac5a8f61f4e8273d04509dffe7d80123ff67f5/manifests/quick-start/base/agent-role.yaml)
* Only ArtifactGC Pods, which can be optionally run to garbage collect artifacts, [use `workflowartifactgctasks`](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/5aac5a8f61f4e8273d04509dffe7d80123ff67f5/manifests/quick-start/base/artifactgc-role.yaml)

These two should ideally be split into their own roles, as they are upstream. This requires a UX change to the Charts, however.

### Impact

The impact of these two is quite minimal, as they only affect status reporting and only for ArtifactGC Pods and HTTP and Plugin templates. So that would only have a mild integrity impact, and that impact already exists upstream for properly privileged roles as well, which is more a limitation of k8s RBAC (in practice, it is effectively impossible to limit to `resourceNames` in this case as they are generated, dynamic names, and then each generated Pod would need custom `resourceNames`, i.e. dynamically generated RBAC).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
