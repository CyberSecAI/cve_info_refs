Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The "Kura Sushi Official App Produced by EPARK" for Android uses a hard-coded cryptographic key.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hard-coded Cryptographic Key (CWE-321):** The application embeds a cryptographic key directly within its code. This makes the key easily accessible to reverse engineers or malicious actors who can examine the application's internals.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Theft:** An attacker who obtains the hard-coded cryptographic key can potentially decrypt or gain access to user login IDs and passwords stored or transmitted by the application. This would allow unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Reverse Engineering:** An attacker can decompile or reverse engineer the Android application to extract the hard-coded cryptographic key. This typically requires technical skills and tools for analyzing application code.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to access the application package itself, which might require local access to a device with the app installed or obtaining the apk file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Technical Skills:** The attacker needs to possess the ability to reverse engineer Android applications.
*  **Access to the App:** The attacker needs access to the application's APK file.
