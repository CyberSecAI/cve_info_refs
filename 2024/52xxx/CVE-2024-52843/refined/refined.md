The provided content is a security bulletin from Adobe, and it does contain information about CVE-2024-52843.

**Vulnerability Details for CVE-2024-52843:**

*   **Root Cause:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it in a web page, leading to stored XSS.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of a victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Network. An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a vulnerable part of the application that is stored and later executed in the browsers of users who access this stored data.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have low privileges (PR:L) and needs the victim to interact with the malicious content (UI:R). The attack complexity is low (AC:L). The scope of the attack is changed (S:C), meaning that the vulnerable component can impact other parts of the application.
