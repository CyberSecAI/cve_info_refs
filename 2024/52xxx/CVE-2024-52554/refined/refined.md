The provided content contains information about multiple CVEs. Here's the breakdown for CVE-2024-52554:

**CVE-2024-52554**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Shared Library Version Override Plugin incorrectly declares folder-scoped library overrides as trusted. This bypasses the Script Security sandbox.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**  A script security sandbox bypass vulnerability. Folder-scoped library overrides are executed without sandbox protection.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller by configuring a folder-scoped library override that bypasses the security sandbox. This could lead to complete system compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker with Item/Configure permission on a folder can configure a folder-scoped library override.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs Item/Configure permission on a folder within the Jenkins instance.

**Summary**

The Shared Library Version Override Plugin prior to version 19.v3a\_c975738d4a_ had a vulnerability where folder-scoped library overrides were incorrectly treated as trusted, bypassing the Script Security sandbox. This allowed attackers with Item/Configure permission to execute arbitrary code by configuring a malicious library override, leading to a high impact vulnerability.
