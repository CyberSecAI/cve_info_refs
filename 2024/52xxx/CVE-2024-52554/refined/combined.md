## Descriptions

### Missing permission check in Script Security Plugin

**SECURITY-3447
/
CVE-2024-52549**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`script-security`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security)**

**Description:**

Script Security Plugin 1367.vdf2fc45f229c and earlier, except 1365.1367.va\_3b\_b\_89f8a\_95b\_ and 1362.1364.v4cf2dc5d8776, does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to check for the existence of files on the controller file system.

Script Security Plugin 1368.vb\_b\_402e3547e7 requires Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation method.

### Rebuilding a run with revoked script approval allowed by Pipeline: Groovy Plugin

**SECURITY-3362
/
CVE-2024-52550**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`workflow-cps`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-cps)**

**Description:**

Pipeline: Groovy Plugin 3990.vd281dd77a\_388 and earlier, except 3975.3977.v478dd9e956c3, does not check whether the main (Jenkinsfile) script for a rebuilt build is approved.

This allows attackers with Item/Build permission to rebuild a previous build whose (Jenkinsfile) script is no longer approved.

|  | This does not apply to builds whose (Jenkinsfile) script was never approved, but only to builds whose (Jenkinsfile) script got its approval revoked. |
| --- | --- |

Pipeline: Groovy Plugin 3993.v3e20a\_37282f8 refuses to rebuild a build whose main (Jenkinsfile) script is unapproved.

### Restarting a run with revoked script approval allowed by Pipeline: Declarative Plugin

**SECURITY-3361
/
CVE-2024-52551**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`pipeline-model-definition`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-model-definition)**

**Description:**

Pipeline: Declarative Plugin 2.2214.vb\_b\_34b\_2ea\_9b\_83 and earlier does not check whether the main (Jenkinsfile) script used to restart a build from a specific stage is approved.

This allows attackers with Item/Build permission to restart a previous build whose (Jenkinsfile) script is no longer approved.

|  | This does not apply to builds whose (Jenkinsfile) script was never approved, but only to builds whose (Jenkinsfile) script got its approval revoked. |
| --- | --- |

Pipeline: Declarative Plugin 2.2218.v56d0cda\_37c72 refuses to restart a build whose main (Jenkinsfile) script is unapproved.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Authorize Project Plugin

**SECURITY-3010
/
CVE-2024-52552**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`authorize-project`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/authorize-project)**

**Description:**

Authorize Project Plugin 1.7.2 and earlier evaluates a string containing the job name with JavaScript on the Authorization view.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.

Authorize Project Plugin 1.8.0 no longer evaluates a string containing the job name with JavaScript on the Authorization view.

### Session fixation vulnerability in OpenId Connect Authentication Plugin

**SECURITY-3473
/
CVE-2024-52553**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`oic-auth`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/oic-auth)**

**Description:**

OpenId Connect Authentication Plugin 4.418.vccc7061f5b\_6d and earlier does not invalidate the existing session on login.

This allows attackers to use social engineering techniques to gain administrator access to Jenkins.

OpenId Connect Authentication Plugin 4.421.v5422614eb\_e0a\_ invalidates the existing session on login.

### XXE vulnerability in IvyTrigger Plugin

**SECURITY-2954
/
CVE-2022-46751**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ivytrigger`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ivytrigger)**

**Description:**

IvyTrigger Plugin 1.01 and earlier bundles versions of Apache Ivy vulnerable to CVE-2022-46751.

This allows attackers able to control the input files for the "IvyTrigger - Poll with an Ivy script" build trigger to have Jenkins parse a crafted XML document that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

IvyTrigger Plugin 1.02 updates the bundled Apache Ivy version to 2.5.2, which is unaffected by this issue.

### Script security sandbox bypass vulnerability in Shared Library Version Override Plugin

**SECURITY-3466
/
CVE-2024-52554**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`shared-library-version-override`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/shared-library-version-override)**

**Description:**

Shared Library Version Override Plugin 17.v786074c9fce7 and earlier declares folder-scoped library overrides as trusted, so that they’re not executed in the Script Security sandbox.

This allows attackers with Item/Configure permission on a folder to configure a folder-scoped library override that runs without sandbox protection.

Shared Library Version Override Plugin 19.v3a\_c975738d4a\_ declares folder-scoped library overrides as untrusted, so that they’re executed in the Script Security sandbox.
