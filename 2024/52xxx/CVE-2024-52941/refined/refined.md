Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-52941:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the improper neutralization of input during web page generation, specifically within the Veritas Enterprise Vault software when viewing archived content. This allows for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into HTTP requests. These scripts are then reflected back to the user without proper sanitization, enabling the execution of arbitrary code within the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:**  A successful XSS attack can lead to the execution of malicious code within the victim's browser, which can have the following impacts:
    *   **Session Hijacking:**  Stealing session cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate the user.
    *   **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive data within the user's session or browser.
    *   **Malware Installation:** Redirecting the user to malicious websites, which can lead to malware infections.
    *   **Phishing:** Displaying fake login forms, which allow the attacker to steal credentials.
    *   **Defacement:**  Modifying the appearance of the web page.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Parameter Injection:** The attacker injects malicious script into an HTTP parameter, which is then reflected back to the user in the web page.
*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Enterprise Vault system.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction, as the injected script only executes when a user views the manipulated content.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Severity:** The vulnerability is classified as "Medium" with a CVSS v3.1 Base Score of 5.4.
*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Veritas Enterprise Vault, including 15.1, 15.0, 15.0.1, 15.0.2, 14.5, 14.5.2, 14.5.1, 14.4, 14.4.1, 14.4.2, 14.3, 14.3.1, 14.3.2, 14.2, 14.2.3, 14.2.2, 14.2.1, 14.1.3, 14.1.2, 14.1.1, 14.1, 14.0.1, and 14.0. Earlier unsupported versions may also be affected.
*  **Patch Availability:** Veritas has released security patches for versions 14.5.2, 15.0 and 15.1. Users are advised to upgrade their systems with the provided patches.
