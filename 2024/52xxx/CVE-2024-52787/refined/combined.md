|  | [PRODUCT] |
|  | libre-chat |
|  |  |
|  | [VERSION] |
|  | libre-chat v0.0.6 |
|  |  |
|  | [PROBLEM TYPE] |
|  | Path Traversal |
|  |  |

|  |  |
|  | [DESCRIPTION] |
|  | A path traversal vulnerability exists in the upload\_documents method of libre-chat versions <= v0.0.6, specifically in the src/libre\_chat/router.py file. This vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the filename of an uploaded file. By supplying a specially crafted filename (e.g., /../../test.txt), an attacker can perform a path traversal attack, leading to arbitrary file writes on the server. In severe cases, this may result in the modification or disclosure of critical system files, such as /etc/passwd, when crafted filenames like /../../etc/passwd are used. The root cause of this vulnerability is the application's failure to adequately sanitize or validate filenames for uploaded files, enabling attackers to traverse directories and overwrite files outside the intended upload directory. |

Hello, i find a issue in `src/libre_chat/router.py`, there may be a path Traversal vulnerability in method `upload_documents`.

if the filename of a `uploaded` in `files` be `/../../../../../../../test.txt` (e.g., modified by Burp), it may lead to a vulnerability that allows arbitrary file writes.

Sorry, something went wrong.
