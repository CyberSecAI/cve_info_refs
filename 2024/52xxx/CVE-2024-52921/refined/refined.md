{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A peer sending mutated blocks could clear the download state of other peers that also announced the block, hindering block propagation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Bitcoin Core did not properly isolate block download states between peers.",
      "A mutated block from one peer could interfere with the block download process of other peers, particularly affecting compact block relay."
    ],
    "impact": "Hindered block propagation, particularly affecting compact block relay. If a node was attempting to reconstruct a block from a compact block received from one peer, a mutated block from a different peer could cause the node to discard the reconstruction state. This would result in valid block data not being used.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious peer sending an unrequested mutated block to target nodes.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a peer connected to the target node and capable of sending manipulated block data."
  },
  "affected_versions": "Bitcoin Core versions prior to v25.0",
  "patch_details": "The issue was fixed in pull request [#27608](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27608). This fix ensures that a peer can only affect its own block download state and not the download state of other peers.",
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is considered a Medium severity issue."
