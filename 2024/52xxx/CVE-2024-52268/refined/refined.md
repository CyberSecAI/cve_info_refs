Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The "Custom Alert Content" feature within the VK All in One Expansion Unit WordPress plugin did not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code. Specifically, the plugin failed to strip `<iframe>` tags.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious JavaScript code could be saved within the plugin's settings ("Custom Alert Content") and then executed in the browsers of users who view the affected website page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser, leading to actions such as:
    - Cookie theft
    - Session ID hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "Custom Alert Content" settings within the plugin's admin panel.
- An attacker would need to have administrative privileges to access and modify these settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrator access:** The attacker must have administrative privileges on the WordPress site to access the plugin settings and inject the malicious script.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vendor has released a patch (version 9.100.1.0) that removes any iframe tags entered in the "Custom Alert Content" section.
- The vendor also notes that lower-privileged users such as editors or authors could achieve similar XSS by using the standard custom HTML block, which is not a vulnerability of the plugin, but a general WordPress vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by Umeda Yuugo of Tokyo Denki University.
