Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the evaluation of HTML syntax within project descriptions and comment sections on `hackweek.opensuse.org`. This means that user-supplied HTML is not properly sanitized or escaped before being rendered, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. Malicious HTML or JavaScript code injected by an attacker is stored on the server (in project descriptions or comments) and then executed in the browsers of other users when they view the affected pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Actions:** An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to perform unintended actions on behalf of other users, including:
    *   Liking projects.
    *   Joining projects.
    *   Deleting projects.
*   **Session Hijacking:** While the provided information indicates that session cookies are set as `httpOnly` and are therefore protected from direct access via JavaScript, other malicious actions are still possible, such as modifying page content or redirecting users to other sites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Project Descriptions and Comments:**  An attacker can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into a project description or in project comments.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack is triggered when another user views the page containing the malicious payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the `hackweek.opensuse.org` platform. This implies that they need an account that allows them to create or comment on projects.
*   **Knowledge of HTML/JavaScript:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious HTML/JavaScript payloads.
*   **Low User Interaction:** The attacker needs to get another user to view the page that contains the injected malicious code.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Emanuele Cappello and Andrea Mattiazzo.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS score of 5.7 with vector `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N`.
*   A fix was implemented using a "monkey patch" on the production environment.
*   A pull request to sanitize the markdown output was created and merged, further mitigating the vulnerability.
* The code related to the vulnerability is in the `SUSE/hackweek` repository on GitHub.
* The fix involved changes in `app/helpers/markdown_helper.rb`
