The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from Nextcloud Server with your computer. The Desktop client did not stop with an error but allowed by-passing the signature validation, if a manipulated server sends an empty initial signature. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Desktop client is upgraded to 3.14.2 or later.
