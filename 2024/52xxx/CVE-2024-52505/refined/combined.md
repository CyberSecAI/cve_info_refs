[davidegirardi](/davidegirardi)
published
GHSA-c3hj-hg7p-rrq5
Nov 14, 2024

## Package

matrix-appservice-irc

## Affected versions

< 3.0.3

## Patched versions

3.0.3

## Description

### Impact

The provisioning API of the matrix-appservice-irc bridge up to version 3.0.2 contains a vulnerability which can lead to arbitrary IRC command execution as the bridge IRC bot.

### Patches

The vulnerability has been patched in matrix-appservice-irc version 3.0.3.

### Workarounds

Disable or restrict access to the provisioning API.

### Severity

Moderate

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
