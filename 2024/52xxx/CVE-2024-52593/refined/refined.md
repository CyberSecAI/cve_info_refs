{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Missing validation in `NoteCreateService.insertNote`, `ApPersonService.createPerson`, and `ApPersonService.updatePerson`",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application fails to validate the provided 'origin' URLs, allowing an attacker to set arbitrary links.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can set arbitrary 'origin' links, leading to phishing or other attacks against remote users, because vulnerable Misskey instances will use these unverified URLs for clickable links.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is network-based.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "No special privileges are needed. The attacker needs to manipulate the 'origin' link data."
