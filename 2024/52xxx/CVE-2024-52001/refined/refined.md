- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control, allowing portal users to access forbidden service information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inadequate access control mechanisms that allow portal users to bypass intended restrictions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A portal user can access service information that they are not authorized to see, leading to potential confidentiality breaches.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based exploitation; an attacker can use the web interface from the network to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a low privilege account (a portal user account) to exploit the vulnerability. User interaction is not required.
