Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-52526:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to sanitize user-provided input, specifically the "descr" parameter, before rendering it in the HTML of the "Services" tab of a device page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Lack of input sanitization for the "descr" parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of other users' sessions who view the affected device's "Services" tab.
- This can lead to account compromise and unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the victim.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload through the "descr" parameter when creating a service through the "edit device -> services" workflow.
- The injected script executes when other users visit the "Services" tab of the compromised device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with sufficient privileges to create or edit device services.
- They must be able to navigate to the "edit device -> services" workflow.
- No specific network position is mentioned, implying a standard web-based attack is possible.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `/librenms/includes/html/pages/device/services.inc.php` file, specifically around line 87, where the `$service['service_desc']` value is outputted without proper sanitization.
- The exploit requires the user to manually add a service via the edit device page, as the normal "Add Service" interface is not vulnerable.
- The vulnerability is present in LibreNMS versions <= 24.9.1 and is patched in version 24.10.0.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to inject a script tag with a remote source, bypassing length restrictions and injecting arbitrary JavaScript code.
- The fix involves applying `htmlentities` to the output of `$service['service_desc']`, escaping any HTML characters in it.
