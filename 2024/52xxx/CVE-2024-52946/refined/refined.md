- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The adaptive authentication rules are triggered not only during the initial login, but also when a user clicks "Refresh my rights." This leads to an unintended re-evaluation of the authentication rules, causing the user's authentication level to be increased multiple times.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect application of adaptive authentication rules. The system fails to recognize the difference between initial authentication and a user-initiated "refresh" action.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Repeatedly clicking "Refresh my rights" could elevate a user's authentication level beyond what was intended, potentially granting access to applications or resources they should not have access to.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the user interface by repeatedly triggering the "Refresh my rights" feature.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be a valid user of the system with the ability to initiate the "Refresh my rights" action.
