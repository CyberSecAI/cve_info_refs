- An attacker could exploit other underlying database vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `EditTask.php` endpoint, specifically manipulating the `taskID` parameter.
- An attacker can use tools like sqlmap to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application server.
- The attacker needs to have basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques and be able to use tools like sqlmap.
