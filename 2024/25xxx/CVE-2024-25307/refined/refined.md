The provided content is related to CVE-2024-25307.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to unsanitized user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the `booking.php` page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL Injection vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize the `id` parameter in the `booking.php` page, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify sensitive data, or exploit vulnerabilities within the underlying database. This may lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, and potential compromise of the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request to `booking.php` with the `id` parameter. The attacker can manipulate this parameter with malicious SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application, capture the request, and manipulate the `id` parameter. They also need to be familiar with SQL injection techniques and have tools like sqlmap to automate exploitation.
