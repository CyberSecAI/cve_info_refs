| Checklist  * I checked other issues already, but found no answer/solution * I checked the documentation and wiki, but found no answer/solution * I am running the latest version and the issue still occurs * I am sure that this issue is about SteVe (and not about the charging station software or something unrelated to SteVe)  Specifications ``` SteVe Version     : 3.6.0 Operating system  : Ubuntu 22.04.1 JDK               : openjdk version "11.0.20.1" Database          : version 1.0.3  ``` Docker Container Setup Two Docker containers are set up to simulate two OCPP clients for testing purposes. Issue Description A possible security vulnerability was identified where unauthorized termination of transactions is possible due to predictable transaction Ids. The server issues a new transaction ID upon receiving an incomplete `StartTransaction` request and, due to the IDs being auto-incremented, an attacker can predict and use them to terminate other transactions. Steps to Reproduce  1. From the first Docker container (Client 1), a transaction is started:    ```    [2,"1","StartTransaction", {        "connectorId": 1,        "idTag": "test",        "meterStart": 20,        "timestamp": "2023-09-03T12:34:56Z"    }]    ``` 2. From the second Docker container (Client 2), a `StartTransaction` request with an empty idTag is sent to obtain a new transaction Id:  ```    [2, "1", "StartTransaction", {"idTag": ""}] ```  3. Client 2 then sends a `StopTransaction` request using the new transaction ID minus 1:  ``` [2, "1","StopTransaction", {   "meterStop": 1,   "timestamp": "2023-11-06T15:54:23Z",   "transactionId": [Retrieved Transaction ID - 1],   "reason": "EVDisconnected",   "transactionData": [...] }] ```  4.The unauthorized termination of Client 1's transaction is confirmed via the web interface.

Actual behavior The server processes unauthorized `StopTransaction` requests using predicted transaction IDs. |

| From my point of view does the StartTransaction from point 2 violates the OCPP 1.6 schema (fields connectorId, meterStart and timestamp are missing). I think for OCPP 1.6J this should generate a CallError with ErrorCode = OccurenceConstraintViolation. There is no point in processing such a message, because no charging station should send such a mess. |

| I appreciate your insight regarding the schema violation for the StartTransaction message. However, it's important to consider scenarios where a charging station might be compromised. If an attacker gains physical access to a charging station, they could potentially send malformed or incomplete OCPP messages. Therefore, server-side validation is crucial to safeguard against such threats. |

| [@Tano-Coppoletta](https://github.com/Tano-Coppoletta) Maybe you got me wrong, i wanted to say that Steve (server side) should generate a CallError and prevent further processing of the transaction. So your concerns are valid from my point of view. |
