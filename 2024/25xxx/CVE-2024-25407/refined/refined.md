{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The server issues a new transaction ID upon receiving an incomplete `StartTransaction` request and, due to the IDs being auto-incremented, an attacker can predict and use them to terminate other transactions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Predictable transaction IDs",
      "Lack of proper validation of `StartTransaction` requests",
      "Lack of authentication for `StopTransaction` requests"
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthorized termination of charging sessions via `StopTransaction` requests, leading to service disruption and potential financial loss.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending an incomplete `StartTransaction` request to obtain a new transaction ID",
      "Predicting the transaction ID of another charging session",
      "Sending a `StopTransaction` request using the predicted ID."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send OCPP messages to the server, which can be done by compromising a charging station."
