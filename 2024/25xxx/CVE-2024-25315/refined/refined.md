- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `rid` parameter of the `roombook.php` page, leading to SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can compromise the application, gain access to sensitive data, modify data, or potentially exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `roombook.php` with a malicious `rid` parameter, the attacker can inject SQL code into the database query.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and needs to know the vulnerable endpoint `/Hotel/admin/roombook.php`.
