- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow occurs when a long string is pasted into the Host field of the proxy settings within the Driver Booster application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer Overflow. The application does not properly validate the length of the input provided in the host field, allowing a large string to overflow the allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The application crashes due to a buffer overflow.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the application's GUI settings, specifically the proxy settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have access to the Driver Booster application and be able to navigate to the settings and modify the proxy settings.
