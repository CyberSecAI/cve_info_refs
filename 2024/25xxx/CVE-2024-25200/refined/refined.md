- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack overflow occurs within the `jspeFactorFunctionCall` function due to excessive recursion when parsing a very long string containing function call syntax. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs due to an overly long string being passed to the `new Function()` constructor
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack overflow due to unbounded recursion during parsing of a constructed function call
- **Impact of exploitation**: The stack overflow leads to a crash, either through an AddressSanitizer error during debug builds or a segmentation fault in release builds. This can cause a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious JavaScript string that, when passed to the `new Function()` constructor, causes excessive recursion during parsing by the `jspeFactorFunctionCall` function. The provided test case demonstrates how to create this string
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious JavaScript string as input to the Espruino interpreter, likely through a JavaScript program.
