Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper access control within the TYPO3 CMS DataHandler component. Specifically, it allowed direct persistence of File Abstraction Layer (FAL) entities via the `DataHandler`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The DataHandler did not properly restrict which FAL entities could be persisted, leading to unauthorized access.
- **Information Disclosure (CWE-200):** By exploiting the ability to persist FAL entities, attackers could reference files in the fallback storage ("zero-storage"). This fallback storage is a compatibility layer for files in the public web root and outside configured file storages. This allowed retrieval of file names and contents, leading to information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could gain access to files stored in the fallback storage, potentially exposing sensitive information through their names and contents.
- **Confidentiality Impact:** High, as unauthorized access to data is possible.
- **Integrity Impact:** Low, as the vulnerability primarily allows data retrieval and not modification.
- **Availability Impact:** None.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely via the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Backend User Account:** A valid backend user account is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker requires low privileges on the backend system.
- **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by denying direct persistence of `sys_file` entities by default, and by preventing `sys_file_reference` and `sys_file_metadata` entities from referencing files in the fallback storage.
- The patch introduces a new mechanism where data imports from secure origins require explicit enabling through `$dataHandler->isImporting = true;`
- The vulnerability affects multiple TYPO3 versions: 8.0.0-8.7.56, 9.0.0-9.5.45, 10.0.0-10.4.42, 11.0.0-11.5.34, 12.0.0-12.4.10, 13.0.0
- Patched versions are: 8.7.57, 9.5.46, 10.4.43, 11.5.35, 12.4.11, and 13.0.1.
