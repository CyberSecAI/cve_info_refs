    "cveId": "CVE-2024-25180",
    "description": "An issue discovered in pdfmake 0.2.9 allows remote attackers to run arbitrary code via crafted POST request to the path '/pdf'.",
    "officialReferences": [
      "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-25180"
    ]
  },
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability stems from the `dev-playground/server.js` file within the pdfmake repository. This file includes an endpoint `/pdf` that executes arbitrary JavaScript code from the POST request body using `new Function()`. This endpoint is intended for local development and testing, but it's present in the GitHub repository, leading to a potential security risk if accessed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable `dev-playground/server.js` application, potentially gaining complete control of the system. This could lead to data breaches, system compromise, and other malicious activities.",
     "attackVectors": [
        "Network: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through HTTP requests."
      ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker needs to send a crafted POST request containing malicious JavaScript code to the `/pdf` endpoint of the vulnerable application.",
    "requiredAttackerPosition": "The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable application. It is important to note the vulnerable code is not distributed with the npm package, it only exists in the development environment."
  },
   "additionalNotes": [
    "Snyk initially reported this vulnerability, but later amended it, stating it's not a vulnerability in the npm package itself, but rather within the development tool. The vulnerable code is not part of the distributed npm package.",
     "The exploit involves sending a crafted POST request to the `/pdf` endpoint. This endpoint uses `new Function()` to execute arbitrary JavaScript code provided in the request body.",
     "The vulnerable code is present in the `dev-playground` folder, which is intended for local development, not production.",
     "The maintainers of the pdfmake project have argued that the presence of this code in the repository does not constitute a vulnerability in the npm package, and that it's a utility for developers. The CVE was assigned to the repository, not the distributed package."
