Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of proper sanitization or parameterized queries when handling the `orderID` parameter in the `viewEachOrder.php` script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the application's database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Compromise of Application:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the application's data and functionality.
*   **Data Access and Modification:** Attackers can read, modify, or delete sensitive data stored in the database.
*   **Exploitation of Database Vulnerabilities:** Successful exploitation can lead to further compromise depending on the database server's configuration and vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the `viewEachOrder.php` script, where the `orderID` parameter is manipulated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests and parameters.
*   **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have the knowledge and tooling to perform SQL injection attacks (e.g., using sqlmap).
*   **Ability to Intercept/Modify Requests:** Using tools like Burp Suite to capture and modify the requests for testing and exploitation

**Additional details:**

*   The provided text confirms successful exploitation using sqlmap.
*   The exploit was tested on Kali Linux with PHP 8.2.12 and Apache 2.4.58
*   The vulnerable application is "Simple Admin Panel App" version 1.0.
*   The vulnerable parameter is `orderID` in the `viewEachOrder.php` script.
*   The database is identified as MySQL (or MariaDB fork).
*   The current database name 'swiss_collection' was retrieved through the exploit.
