Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from Liferay Portal and Liferay DXP returning different HTTP responses when a site doesn't exist versus when a user lacks permission to access an existing site. This behavior allows an attacker to differentiate between the two scenarios.
- The vulnerability is triggered when `locale.prepend.friendly.url.style=2` is enabled and a custom 404 error page is configured.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The system inadvertently discloses the existence of sites based on the response received for a URL. This bypasses access control mechanisms designed to keep this information private.
- **Inconsistent Response Handling:** The vulnerability exists because of how the application responds when encountering a non-existent page vs an unauthorized request for a page, allowing an attacker to infer different states.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Site Discovery:** Unauthorized users can enumerate URLs and identify the existence of specific sites within the Liferay instance. This information can be used by attackers to target known sites and potentially exploit other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-based:** Attackers can perform this attack remotely by sending HTTP requests to the target Liferay instance.
- **URL Enumeration:** Attackers can generate and test various URLs to probe for site existence.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **No authentication is required:** This is a pre-authentication vulnerability that can be exploited by anonymous attackers.
- **Network access:** The attacker must have network access to the Liferay server.

**Affected Versions:**
- Liferay Portal 7.4.0 and 7.4.1
