The provided content relates to CVE-2024-25418.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in flusity-CMS v2.33.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application lacks proper CSRF protection mechanisms for the `/core/tools/delete_menu.php` endpoint.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful CSRF attack can allow an attacker to trick a logged-in user into performing unintended actions, such as deleting menu items in this case.

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker can craft a malicious HTML page (as shown in the PoC) that, when visited by a logged-in user, will send a forged request to the vulnerable endpoint, leading to unauthorized actions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious website/page, while the user has an active authenticated session with the vulnerable application.
