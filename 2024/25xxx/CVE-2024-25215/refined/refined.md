The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Employee Management System version 1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `aprocess.php` file, where the `pwd` parameter is directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability via the `pwd` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit other vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/370project/process/aprocess.php` with a malicious SQL payload in the `pwd` parameter.
  - Specifically, the provided example uses the `pwd` parameter to inject SQL code, which is then processed by the underlying database.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target application.
- No special privileges are mentioned, implying that an unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests, which can be done using a proxy tool like Burp Suite.
