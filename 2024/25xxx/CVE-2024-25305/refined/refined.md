- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insecure handling of user-supplied input in the login form. Specifically, the `username` parameter is not properly sanitized or parameterized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism, gaining unauthorized access to the application.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a crafted username (e.g., `'or 1=1-- -`) in the login form.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the login page of the application and manipulate the `username` field.
