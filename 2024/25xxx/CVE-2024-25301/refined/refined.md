Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, which matches CVE-2024-25301:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure handling of user-supplied input within the "Template" functionality of the REDAXO CMS, specifically in "/addons/structure/plugins/content/pages/templates.php". The system allows an administrator to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code within a template, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Lack of input sanitization/validation:** The CMS fails to properly sanitize or validate the PHP code entered into the template field.
- **Direct PHP code execution:** The injected PHP code is directly executed by the server, without any form of sandboxing or restrictions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker who gains administrator access can execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **System compromise:** This can allow the attacker to fully compromise the application, access or modify data, and potentially gain further access to the underlying system.
- **Data manipulation:** Attackers can modify or exfiltrate sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web interface:** The attack is performed by interacting with the REDAXO CMS web interface.
- **Specifically, by injecting malicious code into the template via the templates.php page and utilizing the structure/article page to trigger the execution of the code.**

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Administrator privileges:** The attacker must have administrator level access to the REDAXO CMS in order to edit templates.

**Additional Details:**
The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates the vulnerability by inserting PHP code into the template field, which includes system commands for demonstration purposes, such as `cat /etc/passwd`.
The vulnerability is present in REDAXO version 5.15.1 as per the provided text.
It can be triggered by creating or editing an article and selecting the template that contains the malicious PHP code.
The provided content also shows that a similar vulnerability was present in version 5.12.1 and is tracked as CVE-2021-39459. In this older version, the attacker could add malicious php code via a module and trigger the execution via an article.
