{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of a changed Destination Connection ID (DCID) by the lsquic library. Specifically, the library does not properly validate the new DCID against the current Source Connection ID (SCID) when processing a regular packet. If the DCID is changed, the library should initiate the on_dcid_change handler.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of DCID against SCID.",
       "Missing check to ensure the source connection ID doesn't match a changed destination connection ID."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to disrupt or manipulate connections by sending packets with a modified DCID.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending crafted QUIC packets with a changed Destination Connection ID (DCID)."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to send QUIC packets to the target system and be able to observe or predict the connection details in order to manipulate the DCID. The attacker does not need to be on-path."
