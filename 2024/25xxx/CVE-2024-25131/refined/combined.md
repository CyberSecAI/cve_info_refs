Follow up to OSD-21667 - we no longer need the ability to provide custom mustgather images.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Looks a lot better, thanks for getting the version of the image that is the same as the cluster's version.

* Two requests around how we are getting the clusterversion that I think are important to address.
* I could be convinced around removing the existing `backOffLimit` value and am just asking out of curiosity.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Can we unit test this function? Small edge case, but I think this doesn't work when the version is something like `4.14.0-rc.0`

You can use <https://github.com/openshift/managed-cluster-validating-webhooks/blob/f0862cb7bf1869b00e1ab857ee08fcf6fc7f156c/pkg/webhooks/podimagespec/podimagespec_test.go> as an example if you haven't setup a fake kube client before.

Make sure to add RBAC so that the operator is able to get `config.openshift.io/clusterversion` objects <https://github.com/openshift/must-gather-operator/blob/master/deploy/02_must-gather-operator.ClusterRole.yaml>

Do we need the jobTemplate YAML for anything? Should we just default values in the struct itself?

```
job := &batchv1.Job{
  ObjectMeta: metav1.ObjectMeta{
    Name:      instance.ObjectMeta.Name,
    Namespace: instance.ObjectMeta.Namespace,
  },
  Spec: {
    // The rest of the default/non-default values
  }
```

I'm fully on board with this approach, but it's more work. Long term I think it's better and am more than happy to go through with this.

For context to the earlier comment, I'm mostly concerned about the brittleness of these array indices if someone comes in and changes the template in some way. My concerns could also be addressed with unit tests that would fail if someone mucked with the jobTemplate's containers

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2258856#c0)  Robb Gatica    2024-01-17 17:35:59 UTC  ``` The MustGather.managed.openshift.io Custom Defined Resource (CRD) is intended to be used to collect information on the cluster to assist in a support case. The normal procedure for using this resource is to have a cluster administrator create such a resource, which will in turn launch a Job in the openshift-must-gather-operator namespace to perform the collection and upload.  However, no permissions are defined to access the MustGather CRD, developer-privileged accounts can, by using F-02 Bypass in Managed Resources Admission Webhook, create such resources.  The definition of the collection Job is created through a yaml text template evaluated using user-controlled inputs from the MustGather’s spec. Furthermore, user-controlled inputs are not sanitized or otherwise verified. This results in a template injection primitive, with the Job’s yaml definition being almost fully controlled by user inputs (truncation is also possible):  * controllers/mustgather/mustgather_controller.go Template evaluation  * controllers/mustgather/mustgather_controller.go Template initialization  * build/templates/job.template.yaml Template  Also, the MustGather CRD allows specifying the desired service account for the Job, all collection operations are therefore performed under the service account’s identity. One of the two service accounts in the openshift-must-gather-operator is a cluster administrator.  Chaining the properties described above, a standard developer with no privileged permissions on the cluster can create a MustGather object with specially crafted contents (under spec) and set the most privileged service account to run the Job. When the Job runs, the crafted contents will tamper with the templated bash command in the Job’s definition to execute arbitrary commands on the Job’s Pod. Thanks to the service account supplied in the MustGather object, a token with cluster-admin privileges will be present on the Job’s Pod. Impact  An attacker with a standard developer account can elevate his privileges to cluster administrator. From a cluster administrator privilege, the attacker can also read the kube-system/osdManage secret and pivot to the AWS environment with administrator privileges, see F-03 osdManagedAdmin Has Redundant and High privileges on AWS Account. Recommendations  Fixing this issue will require the following:  * Only allow MustGather objects to be created by users with the cluster-admin role.  * Replace the Job definition template by a construction of Go structs.  * Validate user inputs to build the Job definition are in the expected format.  * (If possible) Remove or strip permissions to the minimal required for system:serviceaccount:openshift-must-gather-operator:must-gather-admin   ``` |  |
