- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Simple Admin Panel App fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied data, allowing for the injection of arbitrary script code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could execute arbitrary scripting code in the browser of an unsuspecting user within the context of the affected website. This could lead to stealing cookie-based authentication credentials, among other attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the 'Size Number' field of the 'Add Size' form.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to access the admin panel and use the 'Add Size' form, which likely requires administrative credentials to access.
