Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the `teacher_login.php` script, specifically the `pass` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in the `pass` parameter of the `teacher_login.php` page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could compromise the application.
- Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.
- Modification of data within the database.
- Potentially further exploitation of the underlying database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the HTTP POST request to the `teacher_login.php` page.
- The attacker manipulates the `pass` parameter by injecting SQL code into it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the `teacher_login.php` page, which is likely publicly accessible.
- The attacker doesn't require any special privileges on the server, just the ability to make HTTP requests.
- The attacker can use tools like Burp Suite and sqlmap to exploit this vulnerability.
