  "CVE-2024-25004": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the username handling of KiTTY's duplicate session functionality. Specifically, when KiTTY processes the `__dt` command embedded in a stream, it copies the username into a fixed-size buffer without proper bounds checking, allowing an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory, leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "Insufficient bounds checking and input sanitization when processing the username part of the `__dt` command.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Stack-based buffer overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution in the context of the user running KiTTY. This could lead to full system compromise.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Exploitable via a specially crafted ANSI escape sequence embedded in a stream that KiTTY processes",
          "Attackers can inject this sequence through various means such as a malicious SSH MOTD banner or a compromised `.bashrc` file."
         ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted string to a KiTTY user. This could be achieved by controlling a server the KiTTY user connects to.",
        "attacker_position": "The attacker can be in a remote position, controlling a server the victim is connecting to."
