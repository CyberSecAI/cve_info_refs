The provided content is related to a commit that addresses a SQL injection vulnerability in the QAnything project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the construction of SQL queries using string formatting (`.format()`) with user-provided inputs, instead of using parameterized queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The code uses string formatting to insert user-provided IDs and names directly into SQL queries. This allows an attacker to manipulate the query and potentially access, modify, or delete data they shouldn't have access to. Specifically the following methods in `mysql_client.py` are vulnerable:
    -  `check_kb_exist`
    -  `check_file_exist_by_name`
    -  `get_knowledge_base_name`
    - `delete_knowledge_base`
    - The original code used string formatting to create the `IN` clause in SQL queries, which made them vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify or delete database records, or even gain control over the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted user inputs:  An attacker could inject SQL code through the parameters intended for knowledge base IDs, file IDs, or file names.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to manipulate input parameters passed to the vulnerable methods that construct SQL queries. This would typically be through the application's API or user interface.

**Mitigation:**
The provided commit addresses this vulnerability by using parameterized queries. This involves using placeholders (`%s` in the provided code) in the SQL query and passing the user inputs as separate parameters to the database execution method (`self.execute_query_`). This ensures that the user input is treated as data and not as part of the SQL query itself, thereby preventing SQL injection.
