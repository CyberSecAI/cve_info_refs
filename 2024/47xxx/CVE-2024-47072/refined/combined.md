|  |  |  |
|  |  | <h2 id="vulnerability">Vulnerability</h2> |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | <p>CVE-2024-47072: XStream is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack due to stack overflow from a manipulated |
|  |  | binary input stream.</p> |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | <h2 id="affected\_versions">Affected Versions</h2> |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | <p>All versions until and including version 1.4.20 are affected, if using XStream's BinaryStreamDriver.</p> |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | <h2 id="description">Description</h2> |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | <p>XStream provides a BinaryStreamDriver with an own optimized serialization format. The format uses ids for |
|  |  | string values as deduplication. The mapping for these ids are created on-the-fly at marshalling time. At |
|  |  | unmarshalling time the reader's implementation simply used a simple one-time recursion after reading a mapping |
|  |  | token to process the next normal token of the data stream. However, an endless recursion could be triggered with |
|  |  | manipulated input data resulting in a stack overflow causing a denial of service.</p> |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | <h2 id="reproduction">Steps to Reproduce</h2> |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | <p>Prepare the manipulated data and provide it as input for a XStream instance using the BinaryDriver:</p> |
|  |  | <div class="Source Java"><pre>final byte[] byteArray = new byte[36000]; |
|  |  | for (int i = 0; i &lt; byteArray.length / 4; i++) { |
|  |  | byteArray[i \* 4] = 10; |
|  |  | byteArray[i \* 4 + 1] = -127; |
|  |  | byteArray[i \* 4 + 2] = 0; |
|  |  | byteArray[i \* 4 + 3] = 0; |
|  |  | } |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | XStream xstream = new XStream(new BinaryStreamDriver()); |
|  |  | xstream.fromXML(new ByteArrayInputStream(byteArray)); |
|  |  | </pre></div> |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | <p>As soon as the data gets unmarshalled, the endless recursion is entered and the executing thread is aborted with |
|  |  | a stack overflow error.</p> |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | <h2 id="impact">Impact</h2> |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | <p>The vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error resulting |
|  |  | in a denial of service only by manipulating the processed input stream if the instance is setup with a |
|  |  | BinaryStreamDriver.</p> |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | <h2 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h2> |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | <p>A simple solution is to catch the StackOverflowError in the client code calling XStream. There's no other known |
|  |  | workaround when using the BinaryStreamDriver.</p> |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | <h2 id="credits">Credits</h2> |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | <p>Alexis Challande of Trail Of Bits found and reported the issue to XStream and provided the required information to reproduce it.</p> |
|  |  |  |

([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

< 1.4.21

## Patched versions

1.4.21

## Description

### Impact

The vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error resulting in a denial of service only by manipulating the processed input stream when XStream is configured to use the BinaryStreamDriver.

### Patches

XStream 1.4.21 detects the manipulation in the binary input stream causing the the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationException instead.

### Workarounds

The only solution is to catch the StackOverflowError in the client code calling XStream if XStream is configured to use the BinaryStreamDriver.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

# CVE-2024-47072

## Vulnerability

CVE-2024-47072: XStream is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack due to stack overflow from a manipulated
binary input stream.

## Affected Versions

All versions until and including version 1.4.20 are affected, if using XStream's BinaryStreamDriver.

## Description

XStream provides a BinaryStreamDriver with an own optimized serialization format. The format uses ids for
string values as deduplication. The mapping for these ids are created on-the-fly at marshalling time. At
unmarshalling time the reader's implementation simply used a simple one-time recursion after reading a mapping
token to process the next normal token of the data stream. However, an endless recursion could be triggered with
manipulated input data resulting in a stack overflow causing a denial of service.

## Steps to Reproduce

Prepare the manipulated data and provide it as input for a XStream instance using the BinaryDriver:

```
final byte[] byteArray = new byte[36000];
for (int i = 0; i < byteArray.length / 4; i++) {
      byteArray[i * 4] = 10;
      byteArray[i * 4 + 1] = -127;
      byteArray[i * 4 + 2] = 0;
      byteArray[i * 4 + 3] = 0;
}

XStream xstream = new XStream(new BinaryStreamDriver());
xstream.fromXML(new ByteArrayInputStream(byteArray));

```

As soon as the data gets unmarshalled, the endless recursion is entered and the executing thread is aborted with
a stack overflow error.

## Impact

The vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error resulting
in a denial of service only by manipulating the processed input stream if the instance is setup with a
BinaryStreamDriver.

## Workarounds

A simple solution is to catch the StackOverflowError in the client code calling XStream. There's no other known
workaround when using the BinaryStreamDriver.
