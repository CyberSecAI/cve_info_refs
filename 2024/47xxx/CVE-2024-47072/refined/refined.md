{
  "CVE-2024-47072": {
    "Description": "XStream is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack due to stack overflow from a manipulated binary input stream.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises from an endless recursion triggered by manipulated input data within the BinaryStreamDriver, leading to a stack overflow. The BinaryStreamDriver uses IDs for string values as deduplication. The mapping for these IDs is created on-the-fly. During unmarshalling, the reader's implementation uses a one-time recursion after reading a mapping token to process the next token. However, crafted input can cause this recursion to become infinite.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Stack overflow due to infinite recursion",
      "Improper handling of manipulated binary input stream"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can terminate the application by causing a stack overflow, resulting in a denial of service. This occurs only when the application uses XStream configured with the BinaryStreamDriver.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a manipulated binary input stream processed by XStream's BinaryStreamDriver.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted binary stream to the application using XStream with a BinaryStreamDriver."
