- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of certain Ethernet frames.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in how the Axis devices process specific Ethernet frames, causing a denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation results in the affected Axis device becoming unavailable on the network.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through the network by sending specifically crafted Ethernet frames.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected device.
