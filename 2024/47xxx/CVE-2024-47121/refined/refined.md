The provided content is related to CVE-2024-47121.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The goTenna Pro App uses a weak password for sharing encryption keys via the key broadcast method.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Weak Password Requirements (CWE-521)

**Impact of exploitation:**
If the broadcasted encryption key is captured over RF and the password is cracked via brute force attack, it is possible to decrypt it and use it to decrypt all future and past messages sent via encrypted broadcast with that particular key.

**Attack vectors:**
Capturing broadcasted encryption key over RF.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
Attacker needs to be in proximity to capture RF transmissions. The attacker also needs the ability to perform a brute force attack on the weak password.
