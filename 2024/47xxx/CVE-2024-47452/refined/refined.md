- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Write
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A write operation occurs outside the allocated memory buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing an attacker to gain control of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have access to the target system. The user needs to be tricked into opening a malicious file to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a malicious file that can trigger the vulnerability. The user must open this file on a vulnerable system for the exploit to be successful.
