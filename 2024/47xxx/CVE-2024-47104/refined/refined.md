- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An authenticated user can gain elevated privileges to a physical file by altering its based-on file attributes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control, allowing authenticated users to modify file attributes in a way that leads to privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user can gain elevated privileges to a physical file, which could lead to unauthorized access, data modification, or system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated user can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the based-on file attributes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the IBM i system.
