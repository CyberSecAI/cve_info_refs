Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

SSA-351178: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Solid Edge Before SE2024 Update 9

| Publication Date: | 2024-11-12 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2024-11-12 |
| Current Version: | V1.0 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 7.8 |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score: | 7.3 |

SUMMARY

Solid Edge is affected by multiple file parsing vulnerabilities that could be triggered when the application reads specially crafted files in various formats such as PAR or PSM format, and by a DLL hijacking vulnerability. This could allow an attacker to crash the application or execute arbitrary code.

Siemens has released a new version for Solid Edge SE2024 and recommends to update to the latest version.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2024-47940

The affected applications contain an out of bounds read past the end of an allocated structure while parsing specially crafted PSM files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 7.8 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H |

| CVSS v4.0 Vector | CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:H/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N |
| CWE | CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read |

Vulnerability CVE-2024-47941

The affected applications contain an out of bounds read past the end of an allocated structure while parsing specially crafted PAR files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 7.8 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H |

| CWE | CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read |

Vulnerability CVE-2024-47942

The affected applications suffer from a DLL hijacking vulnerability. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code via placing a crafted DLL file on the system.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 7.3 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H |
