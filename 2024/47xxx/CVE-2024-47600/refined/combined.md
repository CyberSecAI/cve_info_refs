The applications it supports range from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing.

# GHSL-2024-248: OOB-read in format\_channel\_mask in GStreamer - CVE-2024-47600

[![Author avatar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55253029)

## Coordinated Disclosure Timeline

* 2024-09-30: Issue reported at https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/issues/3864
* 2024-09-30: Issue acknowledged
* 2024-12-03: [Fixed and disclosed](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/security/sa-2024-0018.html)

## Project

Gstreamer

## Tested Version

* Development version (2024/09/25)

## Details

### OOB-read in format\_channel\_mask (`GHSL-2024-248`)

An OOB-read vulnerability has been detected in the [format\_channel\_mask](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/blob/a8f8bbef99e28bbf62aeaa774814b5c3a665e9d6/subprojects/gst-plugins-base/tools/gst-discoverer.c#L211) function in `gst-discoverer.c`.

The vulnerability affects the local array `position`, which is defined with a fixed size of 64 elements. However, the function [gst\_discoverer\_audio\_info\_get\_channels](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/blob/a8f8bbef99e28bbf62aeaa774814b5c3a665e9d6/subprojects/gst-plugins-base/tools/gst-discoverer.c#L215) may return a `guint channels` value greater than 64.

This causes the for loop to attempt access beyond the bounds of the `position` array, resulting in an OOB-read when an index greater than 63 is used:

```
static gchar * format_channel_mask (GstDiscovererAudioInfo * ainfo){
...
  GstAudioChannelPosition position[64];
  guint channels = gst_discoverer_audio_info_get_channels (ainfo);
  ...
    for (i = 0; i < channels; i++) {
      GEnumValue *value = g_enum_get_value (enum_class, position[i]);
      my_g_string_append_printf (s, 0, "%s%s", value->value_nick,
          i + 1 == channels ? "" : ", ");
    }

```
#### Impact

This vulnerability can result in reading unintended bytes from the stack.

Additionally, the dereference of `value->value_nick` after the OOB-read can lead to further memory corruption or undefined behavior.

Impact It is possible for a malicious third party to trigger out-of-bounds reads that can result in a crash of the application.  This only affects the gst-discoverer-1.0 commandline tool and not any other applications using GStreamer. Solution The gst-plugins-base 1.24.10 release addresses the issue. People using older branches of GStreamer should apply the patch and recompile.
