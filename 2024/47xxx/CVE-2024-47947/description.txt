Due to missing input sanitization, an attacker can perform cross-site-scripting attacks and run arbitrary Javascript in the browser of other users.Â The "Edit Disclaimer Text" function of the configuration menu is vulnerable to stored XSS.

https://$SCANNER/cgi/admin.cgi?-rdisclaimer+-apre

The stored Javascript payload will be executed every time the ScanWizard is loaded, even in the Kiosk-mode browser.
