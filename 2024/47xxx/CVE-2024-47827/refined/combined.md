### @meln5674 **[meln5674](/meln5674)** commented [Sep 21, 2024](#issue-2540456018) • edited Loading

Fixes [#13637](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/issues/13637)

### Motivation

[This line](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/ce7f9bfb9b45f009b3e85fabe5e6410de23c7c5f/workflow/metrics/metrics_k8s_request.go#L75) introduces a data race by globally storing a round-tripper used by the kubernetes client. If a new request starts before the first one completes, and the first request attempts to use the same round-tripper it originally created before the second finishes upgrading its connection, it will result in a panic due to a nil `net.Conn` in the underlying SPDY implementation. As a result, if the controller makes too many new connections to the API server in a short-enough period of time, it will crash and restart.

While it is sensible to store a global handle to the metrics that this round-tripper records, storing the round-tripper itself is not.

### Modifications

This patch retains the "context" of the metrics (i.e. the actual `ctx` value, plus the handle to the metrics themselves) as global, but scopes the round-tripper to each connection by refactoring the context to its own type and global variable, and uses an embedded pointer to it in the round-tripper implementation to avoid needing downstream changes.

### Verification

E2E functional tests were run locally. Additionally, the PR tests identified in the issue as failing as a result of this race now pass, and the controller logs from running without the race detector were visually inspected to confirm that no panics occurred after multiple re-runs of the originally failing test.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Can anyone comment on [this test failure](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/actions/runs/10974775444/job/30473708609?pr=13641#step:16:12084)? Why is it expecting 404? That metric seems to be reporting healthily [here](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/actions/runs/10974775444/job/30473708609?pr=13641#step:16:5502). Was this maybe a hack added to work around something related to this same issue? |

| I believe this is a flakey test that does just sometimes fail. I don't remember introducing it when the roundtripper was added. I've kicked it to run again.  Anyway, that's for finding this and testing the RC. I will take a proper look when I have access to a proper computer. |

| Regarding the `test-executor` failure, it looks like the executor image is going missing between sometime after its loaded at the start of the test, and it looks like the same thing is happening on a lot of recent runs of it. I've seen similar issues before in my own repo's actions when the runner is low on storage and kubelet tries to garbage collect images I need later in the test. You can mitigate this with the `imageGC{High,Low}ThresholdPercent` [kubelet config fields](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/config-api/kubelet-config.v1beta1/), which are easy enough to set in KinD, but I've never done it in K3s. |

Thanks for investigating and your detailed root cause analysis!

If you want to improve on anything else in the repo, like other data races, flakey tests (which are themselves sometimes due to races), race detecting tests, or anything else, that'd be great 🙂

This LGTM but I'll defer to Alan for final approval and merge since he wrote this code recently

# Controller: Denial of Service via malicious daemon Workflows

Moderate

Oct 28, 2024

## Package

gomod

https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

v3.6.0-rc1

## Patched versions

v3.6.0-rc2

## Description

### Summary

Due to a race condition in a global variable, the argo workflows controller can be made to crash on-command by any user with access to execute a workflow.

This was resolved by [#13641](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/13641)

### Details

These two lines introduce a data race in the underlying SPDY implementation of the Kubernetes API client. If a second request is made before the first completes, it results in a panic due to a null pointer.

This appears to have been added in this commit [9756bab](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/commit/9756babd0ed589d1cd24592f05725f748f74130b) / [#13265](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/pull/13265) / v3.6.0-rc1

### PoC

With the `KUBECONFIG` variable set to an appropriate file with `create` permissions for the `Workflow` kind, execute the following bash script:

```
#!/bin/bash -xeu

while true ; do
    name=$(
        { argo submit /dev/stdin <<'EOF'
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  generateName: curl-
spec:
  entrypoint: main
  templates:
  - name: main
    dag:
      tasks:
        - name: no-op
          template: no-op
          withSequence:
            count: 3
  - name: no-op
    daemon: true
    container:
      image: alpine:3.13
      command: [sleep, infinity]
EOF
    } | head -n1 | awk '{ print $2 }'
    )
    ( sleep 30; argo terminate $name ) &
    sleep 15
done
```

This script creates, and subsequently cleans up, multiple `daemon` pods in rapid succession. Each pod cleanup involves executing a `kill` instruction using the Kubernetes `exec` API, triggering the conditions for the panic. This can be seen when the tests mark the pods as complete, but the workflow itself never completes. Observing the controller logs when this happens shows the panic and restart of the controller every few seconds. In a setup with exponential backoff (e.g. a Kubernetes Pod) this is enough to reliably cause crashes enough to extend this backoff significantly and leave other workflows stalled.

Because the restarted controller believes it has sent the `kill` signal, it will wait indefinitely for the pod to terminate, which it never will, so the attack must constantly garbage-collect its own workflows with the `argo terminate` command, otherwise the maximum concurrently running workflows will be reached. A more sophisticated attack could detect when the workflow has been signaled to clean up and terminate it then instead of relying on a simple timer.

### Impact

A malicious user with access to create workflows can continually submit workflows that do nothing except create and then clean up multiple daemon pods, resulting in a crash-loop that prevents other users' workflows from running. This can be done with only a handful of pods and very little cpu and memory, meaning typical multi-tenant Kubernetes controls such as Pod count and resource quotas are not effective at preventing it.

Because the panic log does not in any way suggest that the issue has anything to do with the daemon pods, and an attacker could easily disguise these daemon pods as part of a genuine workflow, it would be difficult for administrators to discover the root cause of the DoS and the individuals responsible to remove their access.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
