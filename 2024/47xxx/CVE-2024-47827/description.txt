Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. Due to a race condition in a global variable in 3.6.0-rc1, the argo workflows controller can be made to crash on-command by any user with access to execute a workflow. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.6.0-rc2.
