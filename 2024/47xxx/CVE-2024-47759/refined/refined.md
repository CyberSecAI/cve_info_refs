- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  A technician can upload a SVG file containing a malicious script. The script is then executed when any user attempts to view the document's contents.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization/validation of uploaded SVG files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser when they try to view the maliciously crafted SVG file. This can lead to various malicious actions including data theft, session hijacking, or defacement. The vulnerability impacts confidentiality (high) but not integrity or availability.
- **Attack vectors:** Network, specifically through uploading a malicious SVG file to the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a technician with the ability to upload documents to the GLPI application, which requires high privileges. The attacker also needs to craft the malicious SVG payload. User interaction (active) is required since another user must try to view the uploaded document.
