**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a Path Traversal vulnerability (CWE-22) present in 2N Access Commander versions 3.1.1.2 and prior.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path Traversal (CWE-22): The software does not properly sanitize or validate file paths, allowing an attacker to manipulate them to access or create files outside of the intended directories.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file write: Attackers can write files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem, potentially overwriting or creating new files.
- Remote code execution: By writing malicious files (e.g., executables, scripts) to specific locations on the system, the attacker can achieve arbitrary remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack: The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Administrative privileges: The attacker needs to have administrative access to the 2N Access Commander system.
