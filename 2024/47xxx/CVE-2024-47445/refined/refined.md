- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds read, which occurs when a program attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer. This can lead to information disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation results in a memory leak. This means sensitive information stored in memory can be accessed by the attacker, potentially revealing confidential data.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have local access to the system. Additionally, user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability (e.g., by opening a crafted file).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the system and the ability to convince the user to open a specially crafted file or perform other specific actions that trigger the vulnerability.
