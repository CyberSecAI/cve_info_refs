MarkUs, a web application for the submission and grading of student assignments, is vulnerable to path traversal in versions prior to 2.4.8. Authenticated instructors may download any file on the web server MarkUs is running on, depending on the file permissions. MarkUs v2.4.8 has addressed this issue. No known workarounds are available at the application level aside from upgrading.
