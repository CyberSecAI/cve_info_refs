### @david-yz-liu **[david-yz-liu](/david-yz-liu)** commented [Apr 3, 2024](#issue-2221743424) • edited Loading

## Motivation and Context

Made updates based on security alerts.

## Your Changes

**Description**:

1. Removed use of `constantize` in the `NotesController` (though the value of the parameter was being whitelisted already, it seems the CodeQL check didn't understand this).
2. Check user-provided paths in various controller actions to ensure they do not traverse outside of the expected folder. Introduced a new `FileHelper.checked_join` method used for this purpose.

**Type of change** (select all that apply):

* Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)

## Testing

## Questions and Comments (if applicable)

## Checklist

* I have performed a self-review of my own code.
* I have verified that the pre-commit.ci checks have passed.
* I have verified that the CI tests have passed.
* I have reviewed the test coverage changes reported on Coveralls.
* I have added tests for my changes.
* I have updated the Changelog.md file.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Nov 18, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< v2.4.8

## Patched versions

## Description

GitHub Security Lab (GHSL) Vulnerability Report:

* Path Traversal in AutomatedTestsController#download\_file (GHSL-2024-065)
* Path Traversal in ExamTemplatesController#download\_error\_file (GHSL-2024-066)
* Path Traversal in ExamTemplatesController#download\_generate (GHSL-2024-067)
* Path Traversal in StarterFileGroupsController#download (GHSL-2024-068)

### Impact

Multiple path traversal vulnerabilities in different controllers allows authenticated instructors to download any file on the web server MarkUs is running on (depending on the file permissions).

### Patches

MarkUs v2.4.8 has addressed this issue.

### Workarounds

In terms of application level, the best way is to upgrade.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H
