{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability occurs because a page object is freed using the `deletePages()` method, but its reference within a 3D object is not cleared. Subsequently, the 3D object uses this freed reference without validation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use-after-free (CWE-416)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Memory corruption and potential arbitrary code execution. By manipulating the memory layout, an attacker could achieve arbitrary read/write operations, leading to code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted PDF document containing malicious JavaScript code can trigger the vulnerability. Additionally, a malicious website could exploit the vulnerability if the Foxit Reader browser plugin is enabled.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must trick a user into opening a malicious PDF file or visiting a malicious website with the vulnerable browser plugin enabled."
