- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An authentication bypass vulnerability exists due to improper access control on named pipes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control (CWE-288), allowing an alternate path or channel to be exploited.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A low-privilege attacker can execute arbitrary code with high privileges by sending spoofed named pipe messages.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs through named pipes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A low-privilege attacker is required.
