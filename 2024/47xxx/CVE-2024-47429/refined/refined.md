- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds Write
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability is a result of an out-of-bounds write condition, which occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have local access to the system. The attack requires user interaction
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system and needs to convince the user to trigger the vulnerability (User interaction is required)
