The applications it supports range from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing.  Applications can take advantage of advances in codec and filter technology transparently. Developers can add new codecs and filters by writing a simple plugin with a clean, generic interface.

# GHSL-2024-228: OOB-write in subparse/gstssaparse.c in GStreamer - CVE-2024-47541

[![Author avatar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55253029)
Antonio Morales](https://github.com/antonio-morales)

## Coordinated Disclosure Timeline

* 2024-09-30: Issue reported at https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/issues/3870
* 2024-09-30: Issue acknowledged
* 2024-12-03: [Fixed and disclosed](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/security/sa-2024-0023.html)

## Project

GStreamer

## Tested Version

* Development version (2024/09/25)

## Details

### OOB-write in subparse/gstssaparse.c (`GHSL-2024-228`)

An OOB-write vulnerability has been identified in the [gst\_ssa\_parse\_remove\_override\_codes](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/blob/a8f8bbef99e28bbf62aeaa774814b5c3a665e9d6/subprojects/gst-plugins-base/gst/subparse/gstssaparse.c#L235) function of the `gstssaparse.c` file.

This function is responsible for parsing and removing SSA (SubStation Alpha) style override codes, which are enclosed in curly brackets ({}).

The vulnerability is present in the following code snippet:

```
static gboolean gst_ssa_parse_remove_override_codes (GstSsaParse * parse, gchar * txt) {

  gchar *t, *end;
  gboolean removed_any = FALSE;

  while ((t = strchr (txt, '{'))) {
    end = strchr (txt, '}');
    if (end == NULL) {
      GST_WARNING_OBJECT (parse, "Missing { for style override code");
      return removed_any;
    }
    /* move terminating NUL character forward as well */
    memmove (t, end + 1, strlen (end + 1) + 1);
    removed_any = TRUE;
  }

...

```

The issue arises when a closing curly bracket “*}*” appears before an opening curly bracket “*{*” in the input string. For example, consider the following input string:

`0:02:16,00:02:19,376,S}nator, {9}{[INFORMATION]text`

In this case, `memmove()` incorrectly duplicates the substring `nator,` , resulting in:

`0:02:16,00:02:19,376,S}nator, nator, {9}{[INFORMATION]text`

With each successive loop iteration, the size passed to `memmove()` becomes progressively larger (`strlen(end+1)`), leading to a write beyond the allocated memory bounds.

#### Impact

This vulnerability overwrites the entire process memory, leading to a segmentation fault (SEGV).
This includes the metadata of malloc chunks, leading to various errors such as:

* munmap\_chunk(): invalid pointer
* malloc(): corrupted top size
* free(): invalid size

## CVE

* CVE-2024-47541
