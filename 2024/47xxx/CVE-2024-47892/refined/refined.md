{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `PMRUnlockPhysAddressesOSMem` function for on-demand non-4KB PMRs in system memory (UMA). Incorrect protection introduced under PP-159595 in the DDK kernel module resulted in a use-after-free condition.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "Software installed and run as a non-privileged user may conduct GPU system calls to read and write freed physical memory from the GPU, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Improper GPU system calls by a non-privileged user."
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute code as a non-privileged user on the system. They need to have the ability to make GPU system calls."
