    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The `XmlScanner` class in PhpSpreadsheet uses regexes in its `scan` and `findCharSet` methods to prevent XXE attacks. However, these regexes can be bypassed using UCS-4 encoding and encoding guessing as described in the W3C XML specification. The `findCharSet` method fails to detect encodings with more than 8 bits due to missing null byte handling in the regex, allowing an attacker to supply a malicious XML document with a bypassed scanner. This is further exploited as the XML library auto-detects the encoding",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Bypass of XmlScanner's regex-based XXE protection",
        "Failure to detect UCS-4 encoding",
        "Incorrect handling of null bytes in regex",
        "Reliance on regexes for charset detection can be bypassed",
        "XML library auto encoding detection vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can bypass the sanitizer and achieve an XXE attack, leading to potential disclosure of confidential data, denial of service, server-side request forgery, port scanning, and potentially remote code execution if the PHP 'expect' module is loaded.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "By crafting a malicious XML file (e.g., `workbook.xml`) with UCS-4 encoding",
        "Bypassing the regex checks in `XmlScanner`",
         "Including external entities in the XML document which will be processed by the XML parser."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious XML file that will be processed by a vulnerable version of PhpSpreadsheet. This can be done by including a payload that exploits the XXE vulnerability within a file that will be processed by the software",
       "additional_details": "The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a specially crafted Excel file that contains a malicious `workbook.xml` file. The provided Proof-of-Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to create a file that results in an HTTP request to an attacker-controlled server, which can be modified to exfiltrate data or cause denial of service through access to local resources that don't stop returning data."
