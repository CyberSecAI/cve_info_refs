Based on the provided document, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

* **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `@carbon/charts` library and related packages do not properly sanitize custom HTML provided by developers. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of potentially malicious scripts.
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (CWE-79).
* **Impact of exploitation:** Malicious scripts can be executed within the user's browser when they interact with the chart. This could lead to various impacts, including data theft, session hijacking, and other malicious activities, depending on the script injected.
* **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user interacts with a chart that renders unsanitized HTML provided by a developer using the vulnerable library. Attackers would need to inject malicious HTML through a component that uses the library.
* **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to inject malicious HTML into a chart component using the vulnerable library. This could be done by compromising a system that supplies the HTML content or by convincing a developer to introduce malicious code using the vulnerable library.

**Affected products and versions:**

*   `@carbon/charts` versions 0.4.0 - 1.13.16
*   `@carbon/charts-react` versions 0.4.0 - 1.13.16
*   `@carbon/charts-angular` versions 0.4.0 - 1.13.16
*   `@carbon/charts-vue` versions 0.4.0 - 1.13.16
*  `@carbon/charts-svelte` versions 0.4.0 - 1.13.16
