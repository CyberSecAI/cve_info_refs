## Coordinated Disclosure Timeline

* 2024-09-26: Issue reported at https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/issues/3842
* 2024-09-26: Issue acknowledged
* 2024-12-03: [Fixed and disclosed](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/security/sa-2024-0008.html)

## Project

Gstreamer

## Tested Version

Development version (2024/09/25)

## Details

### Null pointer dereference in id3v2\_read\_synch\_uint (`GHSL-2024-235`)

A null pointer dereference has been discovered in the [id3v2\_read\_synch\_uint](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/blob/a8f8bbef99e28bbf62aeaa774814b5c3a665e9d6/subprojects/gst-plugins-base/gst-libs/gst/tag/id3v2.c#L58) function, located in `id3v2.c`.

If `id3v2_read_synch_uint` [is called](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/blob/a8f8bbef99e28bbf62aeaa774814b5c3a665e9d6/subprojects/gst-plugins-base/gst-libs/gst/tag/id3v2.c#L449) with a null `work->hdr.frame_data`, the pointer `guint8 *data` is accessed without validation, resulting in a null pointer dereference.

```
static gboolean id3v2_frames_to_tag_list (ID3TagsWorking * work, guint size){
  guint frame_hdr_size;

  /* Extended header if present */
  if (work->hdr.flags & ID3V2_HDR_FLAG_EXTHDR) {
    work->hdr.ext_hdr_size = id3v2_read_synch_uint (work->hdr.frame_data, 4);
...
}

```
#### Impact

This vulnerability can result in a Denial of Service (DoS) by triggering a segmentation fault (SEGV).

## CVE

* CVE-2024-47542

The applications it supports range from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing.  Applications can take advantage of advances in codec and filter technology transparently. Developers can add new codecs and filters by writing a simple plugin with a clean, generic interface. [Read more ...](features/index.html)  GStreamer is released under the LGPL. The 1.x series is API and ABI stable and supersedes the previous stable 0.10 series. Both can be installed in parallel. | [gst-player gtk+ backend playing Sintel](/data/images/gtk-play-sintel.png) | | --- | --- | |  |
