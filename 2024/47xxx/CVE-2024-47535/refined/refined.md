  "vulnerability_information": {
    "root_cause": "Netty attempts to load specific files (`/etc/os-release`, `/usr/lib/os-release`, and `/proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn`) on Windows systems, even though these files are not relevant to the Windows environment. If an attacker creates a large file at these locations, the application attempts to load the entire file into memory, potentially causing an Out-of-Memory Error (OOME).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unsafe reading of environment files without proper OS verification.",
      "Lack of input validation/size limits when reading files during startup.",
       "Attempting to read Linux specific files on a Windows OS"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). The Netty application crashes due to an Out-of-Memory Error (OOME) when it tries to load a large, attacker-controlled file into memory.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local file system access. An attacker needs to have a user account on the system where the Netty application is running."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to create files on the local file system.",
      "A user account with low privileges to create directories and files."
    ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered due to Netty's attempt to read files typically found on Linux systems (e.g., `/etc/os-release`) even when running on Windows. The `normalizeOs()` function does not prevent the code from attempting to read these files on a Windows OS. The fix was to implement a `BoundedInputStream` to limit the amount of data read from the files. The vulnerability can be exploited by creating a file larger than 1GB in the expected path on the Windows filesystem and then starting the vulnerable Netty application."
