  "CVE-2024-47546": {
    "description": "Integer underflow in MP4/MOV demuxer that can lead to out-of-bounds reads.",
    "root_cause": "An integer underflow vulnerability exists in the `extract_cc_from_data` function within `qtdemux.c`. Specifically, when processing CEA708 closed caption data (`FOURCC_c708`), the code calculates the data length by subtracting 8 from the atom length (`atom_length - 8`). If `atom_length` is less than 8, this operation underflows, resulting in a large positive value for `*cclen`.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Integer underflow",
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "The integer underflow leads to an out-of-bounds read when `g_memdup2` is called with the underflowed size. This can result in reading up to 4GB of process memory, potentially causing a segmentation fault (SEGV) and application crash.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted MP4/MOV files containing CEA708 closed caption data with a small `atom_length` value"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted MP4/MOV file that triggers the integer underflow in the `extract_cc_from_data` function."
