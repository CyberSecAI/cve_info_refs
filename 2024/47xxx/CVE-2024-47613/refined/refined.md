{
  "cve": "CVE-2024-47613",
  "description": "A null pointer dereference vulnerability has been identified in gst_gdk_pixbuf_dec_flush within gstgdkpixbufdec.c. This function invokes memcpy, using out_pix as the destination address. out_pix is expected to point to the frame 0 from the frame structure, which is read from the input file. However, in certain situations, it can points to a NULL frame, causing the subsequent call to memcpy to attempt writing to the null address (0x00), leading to a null pointer dereference.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `gst_gdk_pixbuf_dec_flush` function attempts to use the `out_pix` pointer without verifying if it is valid. In some cases, `out_pix` can be NULL.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious third party can cause a denial of service by triggering a segmentation fault when a NULL pointer dereference occurs, crashing the application.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when the `gst_gdk_pixbuf_dec_flush` function attempts to write to a NULL memory location.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a crafted input file that leads to a NULL `out_pix` pointer. "
  },
    "patch": "The issue was resolved by adding a check to ensure that `gst_video_info_set_format` succeeds before proceeding. If the format is not supported, the function returns an error, preventing the use of a NULL pointer later in the code."
