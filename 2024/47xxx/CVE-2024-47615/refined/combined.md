## Project

Gstreamer

## Tested Version

* Development version (2024/09/25)

## Details

### Issue 1: Stack-buffer overflow in vorbis\_handle\_identification\_packet (`GHSL-2024-115`)

A stack-buffer overflow has been detected in the [vorbis\_handle\_identification\_packet](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/blob/a8f8bbef99e28bbf62aeaa774814b5c3a665e9d6/subprojects/gst-plugins-base/ext/vorbis/gstvorbisdec.c#L184) function within `gstvorbisdec.c`.

The [position](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/blob/a8f8bbef99e28bbf62aeaa774814b5c3a665e9d6/subprojects/gst-plugins-base/ext/vorbis/gstvorbisdec.c#L206) array is a stack-allocated buffer of size 64. If `vd->vi.channels` exceeds 64, the for loop will write beyond the boundaries of the `position` array:

```
static GstFlowReturn vorbis_handle_identification_packet (GstVorbisDec * vd){

GstAudioInfo info;

  switch (vd->vi.channels) {
   ...
    default:{
      GstAudioChannelPosition position[64];
      gint i, max_pos = MAX (vd->vi.channels, 64);
   ...

    for (i = 0; i < max_pos; i++)
        position[i] = GST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_NONE;
      gst_audio_info_set_format (&info, GST_VORBIS_AUDIO_FORMAT, vd->vi.rate, vd->vi.channels, position);
      break;
    }
  }
  gst_audio_decoder_set_output_format (GST_AUDIO_DECODER (vd), &info);

  vd->info = info;
  ...
  return GST_FLOW_OK;
}

```

The value written will always be `GST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_NONE`.

This vulnerability allows to overwrite the EIP address allocated in the stack. Additionally, this bug can overwrite the `GstAudioInfo info` structure.

#### Impact

This vulnerability may corrupt control data on the stack, such as the return address (EIP) or the `GstAudioInfo info` structure.

### Issue 2: Stack-buffer overflow in gst\_opus\_dec\_parse\_header (`GHSL-2024-116`)

A stack-buffer overflow has been detected in the [gst\_opus\_dec\_parse\_header](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/blob/a8f8bbef99e28bbf62aeaa774814b5c3a665e9d6/subprojects/gst-plugins-base/ext/opus/gstopusdec.c#L397) function within `gstopusdec.c’.

The `pos` array is a stack-allocated buffer of size 64. If `n_channels` exceeds 64, the for loop will write beyond the boundaries of the `pos` array:

```
static GstFlowReturn gst_opus_dec_parse_header (GstOpusDec * dec, GstBuffer * buf){

  GstAudioChannelPosition pos[64];
  const GstAudioChannelPosition *posn = NULL;
  guint8 n_channels;
  ...
  dec->n_channels = n_channels;
  ...
    switch (dec->n_channels) {
  ...
      default:{
        gint i;
  ...
        for (i = 0; i < dec->n_channels; i++)
          pos[i] = GST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_NONE;

        posn = pos;
      }
  ...
}

```

The value written will always be `GST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_NONE`.

This bug allows to overwrite the EIP address allocated in the stack.

#### Impact

This vulnerability may corrupt control data on the stack, such as the return address (EIP).

### Issue 3: OOB-Write in gst\_parse\_vorbis\_setup\_packet (`GHSL-2024-117`)

An OOB-Write has been detected in the function [gst\_parse\_vorbis\_setup\_packet](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/blob/a8f8bbef99e28bbf62aeaa774814b5c3a665e9d6/subprojects/gst-plugins-base/ext/ogg/vorbis_parse.c#L101) within `vorbis_parse.c`.

The integer `size` is read from the input file without proper validation. As a result, `size` can exceed the fixed size of the [pad->vorbis\_mode\_sizes](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/blob/a8f8bbef99e28bbf62aeaa774814b5c3a665e9d6/subprojects/gst-plugins-base/ext/vorbis/gstvorbisenc.h#L86) array (which size is 256):

```
struct _GstVorbisEnc {
  ....
  int              vorbis_mode_sizes[256];
};

```

When this happens, the for loop overwrites the entire `pad` structure with 0s and 1s, affecting adjacent memory as well.

```
void gst_parse_vorbis_setup_packet (GstOggStream * pad, ogg_packet * op){

  unsigned char *current_pos = &op->packet[op->bytes - 1];
  int offset;
  int size;
  int size_check;
  int *mode_size_ptr;
  int i;
  int ii;

  ...

  mode_size_ptr = pad->vorbis_mode_sizes;

  for (i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    offset = (offset + 1) % 8;
    if (offset == 0)
      current_pos += 1;
    *mode_size_ptr++ = (current_pos[0] >> offset) & 0x1;
    current_pos += 5;
  }

}

```
#### Impact

This OOB-write can overwrite up to 380 bytes of memory beyond the boundaries of the `pad->vorbis_mode_sizes` array.

This vulnerability triggers other memory issues (such as invalid frees) and disrupts the program’s execution flow.

### Issue 4: Null pointer dereference in gst\_gdk\_pixbuf\_dec\_flush (`GHSL-2024-118`)

A null pointer dereference vulnerability has been identified in [gst\_gdk\_pixbuf\_dec\_flush](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/blob/a8f8bbef99e28bbf62aeaa774814b5c3a665e9d6/subprojects/gst-plugins-good/ext/gdk_pixbuf/gstgdkpixbufdec.c#L283) within `gstgdkpixbufdec.c`.

This function invokes `memcpy`, using `out_pix` as the destination address. `out_pix` is expected to point to the frame 0 from the `frame` structure, which is read from the input file.

However, in certain situations, it can points to a NULL frame, causing the subsequent call to `memcpy` to attempt writing to the null address (0x00), leading to a null pointer dereference.

```
static GstFlowReturn gst_gdk_pixbuf_dec_flush (GstGdkPixbufDec * filter) {
  ...
  guint8 *out_pix;
  ...
  GstVideoFrame frame;
  ...
  gst_video_frame_map (&frame, &filter->info, outbuf, GST_MAP_WRITE);
  out_pix = GST_VIDEO_FRAME_PLANE_DATA (&frame, 0);
  out_rowstride = GST_VIDEO_FRAME_PLANE_STRIDE (&frame, 0);

  for (y = 0; y < height; y++) {
    memcpy (out_pix, in_pix, width * GST_VIDEO_FRAME_COMP_PSTRIDE (&frame, 0));
    in_pix += in_rowstride;
    out_pix += out_rowstride;
  }
  ...

```
#### Impact

This vulnerability can result in a Denial of Service (DoS) by triggering a segmentation fault (SEGV).

The unstable 1.25 release series is for testing and development purposes in the lead-up to the stable 1.26 series which is scheduled for release ASAP. Any newly-added API can still change until that point.  This development release is primarily for developers and early adopters.  The plan is to get 1.26 out of the door as quickly as possible.  Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows will be made available shortly at the [usual location](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/pkg/).

The applications it supports range from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing.  Applications can take advantage of advances in codec and filter technology transparently. Developers can add new codecs and filters by writing a simple plugin with a clean, generic interface. [Read more ...](features/index.html)  GStreamer is released under the LGPL. The 1.x series is API and ABI stable and supersedes the previous stable 0.10 series. Both can be installed in parallel. | [gst-player gtk+ backend playing Sintel](/data/images/gtk-play-sintel.png) | | --- | --- | |  |
