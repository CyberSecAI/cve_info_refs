Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities addressed in the provided content:

**1. CVE-2024-47093 (Based on associated commit and changelog)**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled input in the `std_table.php` gadget within NagVis.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The `std_table.php` gadget was vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Specifically, the code was not properly encoding or sanitizing data before displaying it in the web page.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful XSS attack could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page. This could lead to various consequences, including:
    *   Stealing user session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacing the web page.
    *   Potentially gaining access to sensitive data displayed on the NagVis dashboard.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the `std_table.php` gadget, where unsanitized data was being displayed.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to influence the data that is being displayed within the NagVis interface to inject malicious script. This could be done by injecting crafted data into Nagios and displayed by the NagVis gadget.

**2. RCE Vulnerability due to Malicious Map Uploads (Associated commit and changelog)**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability was caused by the ability to upload and configure malicious map files in NagVis without proper validation of the file contents.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  The system did not validate the uploaded map configuration files. This allowed an attacker to upload a malicious file that could contain executable code and lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** By uploading a malicious map file, an attacker could potentially achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server running NagVis, leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the map upload functionality.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to access the map upload functionality within NagVis. The attacker needs to be authenticated to upload and configure a map.

**Additional Vulnerabilities Mentioned in Changelog (www.nagvis.org content):**

*   **Various XSS issues:** Besides the `std_table.php` gadget, XSS issues were also present in malicious graph elements, service names, and script outputs. This indicates a broader problem with input sanitization throughout the application.
*   **Insecure Password Hashing Algorithm:** An insecure password hashing algorithm was used for dedicated NagVis users. This could potentially make password cracking easier if the user database was compromised.
*   **Leak of Installation Path:** The application was leaking its installation path in error messages, which could provide information to an attacker when trying to enumerate the system.
*   **Cookie Hash Comparison Timing:** The comparison of cookie hashes was not timing-safe, which could make the system susceptible to timing attacks.

**Summary of fixes in commit logs:**

*   **30e71e8:** Fixes XSS in `std_table.php` by using `htmlspecialchars()` to sanitize the output.
*   **b5b1164:** Fixes the potential RCE due to malicious map uploads. This likely includes implementing checks and validation on uploaded map files.

In conclusion, the content indicates several security vulnerabilities in NagVis, including XSS and RCE. The commit logs and changelog detail fixes related to XSS in the `std_table.php` gadget, RCE via map upload, insecure password hashing, path leakage, and timing attacks.

The `std_table.php` XSS vulnerability, now addressed, is likely the subject of CVE-2024-47093 based on the commit fix and the changelog referencing the CVE being requested.
