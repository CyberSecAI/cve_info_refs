Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the WordPress Elementor Addon Elements plugin. This lack of proper access control allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Broken Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is a broken access control issue, stemming from the inadequate authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The specific impact can vary on a case by case basis because the report is generic to the vulnerability type. However, it is stated that it has a low severity impact and is unlikely to be exploited. In general broken access control can allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to functionality they shouldn't have access to.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves exploiting a function lacking proper access control checks. The specific function is not detailed, but the vulnerability allows an unprivileged user to execute a privileged action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a "contributor", implying a role with some minimal level of access, but does not require administrative privileges.
