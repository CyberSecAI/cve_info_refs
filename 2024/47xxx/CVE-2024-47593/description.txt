SAP NetWeaver Application Server ABAP allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access to read files from the server, which otherwise would be restricted.This attack is possible only if a Web Dispatcher or some sort of Proxy Server is in use and the file in question was previously opened or downloaded in an application based on SAP GUI for HTML Technology. This will not compromise the application's integrity or availability.
