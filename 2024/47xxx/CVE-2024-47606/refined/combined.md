# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Impact It is possible for a malicious third party to trigger out-of-bounds writes that can result in a crash of the application, or potentially possibly also allow code execution through heap manipulation. Solution The GStreamer core and gst-plugins-good 1.24.10 release addresses the issue. People using older branches of GStreamer should apply the patch and recompile.

The applications it supports range from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing.  Applications can take advantage of advances in codec and filter technology transparently. Developers can add new codecs and filters by writing a simple plugin with a clean, generic interface. [Read more ...](features/index.html)  GStreamer is released under the LGPL. The 1.x series is API and ABI stable and supersedes the previous stable 0.10 series. Both can be installed in parallel. | [gst-player gtk+ backend playing Sintel](/data/images/gtk-play-sintel.png) | | --- | --- | |  |

* 2024-12-03: [Fixed and disclosed](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/security/sa-2024-0014.html)

## Project

Gstreamer

## Tested Version

1.25.0.1

## Details

### Integer underflow in qtdemux\_parse\_theora\_extension leading to function pointer overwrite (`GHSL-2024-166`)

An integer underflow has been detected in the function [qtdemux\_parse\_theora\_extension](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/blob/a8f8bbef99e28bbf62aeaa774814b5c3a665e9d6/subprojects/gst-plugins-good/gst/isomp4/qtdemux.c#L8812) within `qtdemux.c`.

The vulnerability occurs due to an underflow of the `gint size` variable, which causes `size` to hold a large unintended value when cast to an unsigned integer:

```

static gboolean qtdemux_parse_theora_extension (GstQTDemux * qtdemux, QtDemuxStream * stream, GNode * xdxt){
...
   gint size;
...
   size -= 8; //Size value = -7 => 0xfffffff9 (unsigned)
...
}

```

This 32-bit negative value is then cast to a 64-bit unsigned integer (0xfffffffffffffffa) in a subsequent call to [gst\_buffer\_new\_and\_alloc](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/blob/a8f8bbef99e28bbf62aeaa774814b5c3a665e9d6/subprojects/gst-plugins-good/gst/isomp4/qtdemux.c#L8844):

```
        buffer = gst_buffer_new_and_alloc (size);
        gst_buffer_fill (buffer, 0, buf, size);
        stream->buffers = g_slist_append (stream->buffers, buffer);

```

The function [gst\_buffer\_new\_allocate](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/blob/a8f8bbef99e28bbf62aeaa774814b5c3a665e9d6/subprojects/gstreamer/gst/gstbuffer.c#L897) then attempts to allocate memory, eventually calling `_sysmem_new_block`.

The function [\_sysmem\_new\_block](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/blob/a8f8bbef99e28bbf62aeaa774814b5c3a665e9d6/subprojects/gstreamer/gst/gstallocator.c#L420) adds alignment and header size to the (unsigned) size, causing the overflow of the ‘slice\_size’ variable. As a result, only 0x89 bytes are allocated, despite the large input size:

```
static GstMemorySystem *_sysmem_new_block (GstMemoryFlags flags, gsize maxsize, gsize align, gsize offset, gsize size){
...
  /* ensure configured alignment */
  align |= gst_memory_alignment;
  /* allocate more to compensate for alignment */
  maxsize += align;
  /* alloc header and data in one block */
  slice_size = sizeof (GstMemorySystem) + maxsize; => 0x89!!!!

  mem = g_malloc (slice_size);
...

```

When the following `memcpy` call occurs in [gst\_buffer\_fill](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/blob/a8f8bbef99e28bbf62aeaa774814b5c3a665e9d6/subprojects/gstreamer/gst/gstbuffer.c#L1944), the data from the input file will overwrite the content of the `GstMapInfo info` structure:

```
gsize gst_buffer_fill (GstBuffer * buffer, gsize offset, gconstpointer src, gsize size){
...
   memcpy ((guint8 *) info.data + offset, ptr, tocopy);
...
}

```

Finally, during the call to [gst\_memory\_unmap](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/blob/a8f8bbef99e28bbf62aeaa774814b5c3a665e9d6/subprojects/gstreamer/gst/gstmemory.c#L343), the overwritten memory may cause a function pointer hijack, as the `mem->allocator->mem_unmap_full` function is called with a corrupted pointer:

```
void gst_memory_unmap (GstMemory * mem, GstMapInfo * info){
...
  if (mem->allocator->mem_unmap_full)
    mem->allocator->mem_unmap_full (mem, info);
  else
    mem->allocator->mem_unmap (mem);
...
}

```

This function pointer overwrite could allow an attacker to alter the execution flow of the program, leading to arbitrary code execution.

#### Impact

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to hijack the execution flow, potentially leading to code execution.
