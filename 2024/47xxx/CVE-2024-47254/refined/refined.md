- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The system does not properly verify the authenticity of data, allowing an attacker to manipulate data in a way that leads to privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can escalate their privileges and gain root access to the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Adjacent network access. Requires user interaction from the attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges and be on the same adjacent network, in addition to tricking an administrator into taking some action with user interaction being required.
