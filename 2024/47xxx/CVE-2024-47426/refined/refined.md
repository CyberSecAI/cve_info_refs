The provided content is related to CVE-2024-47426.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a Double Free condition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a Double Free (CWE-415), which occurs when memory that has already been freed is freed again.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is local (AV:L), with low attack complexity (AC:L), no privileges required (PR:N), user interaction required (UI:R), and the scope is unchanged (S:U).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to induce a user to perform an action that triggers the double free, which is typically related to processing a crafted file. The attacker needs to have local access, user interaction to perform the exploit.
