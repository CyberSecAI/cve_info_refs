Subject: CVE-2024-47249: Apache NimBLE: Lack of input sanitization leading
 to out-of-bound reads in multiple advertisement handler

Severity: low

Affected versions:

- Apache NimBLE through 1.7.0

Description:

Improper Validation of Array Index vulnerability in Apache NimBLE.

Lack of input validation for HCI events from controller could result in out-of-bound memory corruption and crash.
This issue requires broken or bogus Bluetooth controller and thus severity is considered low.
This issue affects Apache NimBLE: through 1.7.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.8.0, which fixes the issue.

```
Advertising instance is used for indexing slave state array. Since
instance is provided by host invalid handle in event means there is
bug in controller.
