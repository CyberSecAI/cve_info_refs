A vulnerability has been identified in SINEC NMS (All versions < V3.0 SP1). The affected application contains a database function, that does not properly restrict the permissions of users to write to the filesystem of the host system.
This could allow an authenticated medium-privileged attacker to write arbitrary content to any location in the filesystem of the host system.
