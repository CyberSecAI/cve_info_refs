## Description

### CWE-35: Path Traversal

<https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/35.html>

### CVSSv3.1 4.3 - Medium

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N

### Summary

We have identified a vulnerability in **Agnai** that permits attackers to read arbitrary JSON files at attacker-chosen locations on the server. This issue can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information and exposure of confidential configuration files.

**This only affects installations with `JSON_STORAGE` enabled which is intended to local/self-hosting only.**

### Details & PoC

This is a path traversal vulnerability. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request:

```
GET /api/json/messages/%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%61%70%70%2fpackage HTTP/1.1
```

In this example, the attacker retrieves the `package.json` file content from the server by manipulating the file path.

The request is processed by the `loadMessages` handler in `agnai/srv/api/json/index.ts` and a file is read and returned to the client. The read filename is constructed using string interpolation, with no guard or check for path traversal:

[agnai/srv/api/json/index.ts](https://github.com/agnaistic/agnai/blob/2b878b7ca66471c5dd080197ad9ca2f7f0022655/srv/api/json/index.ts#L77)

[2b878b7](/agnaistic/agnai/commit/2b878b7ca66471c5dd080197ad9ca2f7f0022655)

|  | const messages = await read(`messages-${params.id}.json`) |
| --- | --- |

#### Constraints

Environment constraints: JSON Storage enabled (non standard)

### Impact

This vulnerability is classified as a path traversal vulnerability. Specifically, any JSON file on the server which the webserver process has read privileges for, can be disclosed to the attacker.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
