Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-47547:

**CVE-2024-47547**

*   **Root Cause:** The Ruijie Reyee OS versions 2.206.x up to but not including 2.320.x have a weak mechanism for users to change their passwords.
*   **Weakness:** Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password (CWE-640).
*   **Impact:** The weak password recovery mechanism makes authentication vulnerable to brute force attacks. This could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network-based attacks.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** No special capabilities or privileged access is needed. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable and has low attack complexity.

**Summary of other vulnerabilities mentioned in the document:**

The document also details several other vulnerabilities affecting the same Ruijie Reyee OS versions:

*   **CVE-2024-42494:** Exposure of private personal information to unauthorized actors. Allows sub-accounts or attackers to view and exfiltrate sensitive information from all cloud accounts registered to Ruijie's services.
*   **CVE-2024-51727:** Premature release of resources during expected lifetime. Allows attackers to invalidate a legitimate user's session, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
*   **CVE-2024-47043:** Insecure storage of sensitive information. Enables an attacker to correlate a device's serial number, user's phone number, and part of the email address.
*   **CVE-2024-45722:** Use of weak credentials. The system uses a weak credential mechanism that could allow an attacker to calculate MQTT credentials.
*   **CVE-2024-47791:** Improper neutralization of wildcards or matching symbols. Allows an attacker to subscribe to partial topics in the Ruijie MQTT broker and receive partial messages.
*   **CVE-2024-46874:** Improper handling of insufficient permissions or privileges. Allows MQTT clients with device credentials to send messages to some topics, allowing attackers to issue commands to other devices on behalf of Ruijie's cloud.
*  **CVE-2024-48874**: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). Allows attackers to force Ruijie's proxy servers to perform arbitrary requests, potentially accessing internal services and cloud infrastructure.
*   **CVE-2024-52324:** Use of an inherently dangerous function. Allows attackers to send malicious MQTT messages that could result in arbitrary OS command execution.
*   **CVE-2024-47146:** Transmission of private resources into a new sphere ('resource leak'). Allows attackers to obtain a device's serial number by sniffing RAW WIFI signals if physically adjacent to the device.

**Mitigation:**

Ruijie reports that the issues have been fixed on the cloud, and no action is needed by end users. However, CISA recommends general defensive measures:

*   Minimize network exposure of control system devices.
*   Isolate control system networks behind firewalls.
*   Use secure methods such as VPNs for remote access and ensure that VPNs are updated to the latest versions.
