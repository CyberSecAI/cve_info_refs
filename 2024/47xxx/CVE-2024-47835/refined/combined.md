The applications it supports range from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing.  Applications can take advantage of advances in codec and filter technology transparently. Developers can add new codecs and filters by writing a simple plugin with a clean, generic interface.

# GHSL-2024-263: Null pointer dereference in parse\_lrc in GStreamer - CVE-2024-47835

[![Author avatar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55253029)
Antonio Morales](https://github.com/antonio-morales)

## Coordinated Disclosure Timeline

* 2024-10-07: Issue reported at https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/issues/3892
* 2024-10-09: Issue acknowledged
* 2024-12-03: [Fixed and disclosed](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/security/sa-2024-0029.html)

## Project

Gstreamer

## Tested Version

* Development version (2024/09/25)

## Details

### Null pointer dereference in parse\_lrc (`GHSL-2024-263`)

A null pointer dereference vulnerability has been detected in the [parse\_lrc](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/blob/a8f8bbef99e28bbf62aeaa774814b5c3a665e9d6/subprojects/gst-plugins-base/gst/subparse/gstsubparse.c#L1059) function within `gstsubparse.c`.

The `parse_lrc` function calls `strchr()` to find the character â€˜]â€™ in the string `line`. The pointer returned by this call is then passed to g\_strdup().

However, if the string `line` does not contain the character â€˜]â€™, strchr() returns NULL, and the following call to `g_strdup(start + 1)` leads to a null pointer dereference.

```
static gchar * parse_lrc (ParserState * state, const gchar * line){
...
  start = strchr (line, ']');
  if (start - line == 9)
    milli = 10;
  else
    milli = 1;
...
  return g_strdup (start + 1);
}

```
#### Impact

This vulnerability can result in a Denial of Service (DoS) by triggering a segmentation fault (SEGV).
