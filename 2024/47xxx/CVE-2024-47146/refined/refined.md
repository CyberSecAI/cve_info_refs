The provided content is related to CVE-2024-47146.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to the transmission of the device's serial number in a RAW WIFI signal, which can be sniffed by a physically adjacent attacker. This exposes a private resource (the serial number) to a new sphere (the attacker).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **CWE-402:** Transmission of Private Resources into a New Sphere ('Resource Leak')

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can obtain the device's serial number.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Physical proximity:** The attacker needs to be physically adjacent to the device to sniff the RAW WIFI signal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Physical proximity:** The attacker needs to be within range to intercept the RAW WIFI signal.
*   **Sniffing capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to capture and analyze RAW WIFI packets.
