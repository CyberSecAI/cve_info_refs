# GHSL-2024-251: Null pointer dereference in gst\_matroska\_demux\_update\_tracks in GStreamer - CVE-2024-47603

## Coordinated Disclosure Timeline

* 2024-09-30: Issue reported at https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/issues/3867
* 2024-09-30: Issue acknowledged
* 2024-12-03: [Fixed and disclosed](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/security/sa-2024-0021.html)

## Project

Gstreamer

## Tested Version

* Development version (2024/09/25)

## Details

### Null pointer dereference in gst\_matroska\_demux\_update\_tracks (`GHSL-2024-251`)

A null pointer dereference vulnerability has been discovered in the [gst\_matroska\_demux\_update\_tracks](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/blob/a8f8bbef99e28bbf62aeaa774814b5c3a665e9d6/subprojects/gst-plugins-good/gst/matroska/matroska-demux.c#L3471) function within `matroska-demux.c`.

The vulnerability occurs when the `gst_caps_is_equal` function is called with invalid caps values:

```
static GstFlowReturn gst_matroska_demux_update_tracks (GstMatroskaDemux * demux, GstEbmlRead * ebml){
...
if (!gst_caps_is_equal (old_track->caps, new_track->caps)) {
...

```

If this happen, then in the function [gst\_buffer\_get\_size](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/blob/a8f8bbef99e28bbf62aeaa774814b5c3a665e9d6/subprojects/gstreamer/gst/gstbuffer.c#L1557) the call to `GST_BUFFER_MEM_PTR` can return a null pointer.

Attempting to dereference the size field of this null pointer results in a null pointer dereference:

```
gsize gst_buffer_get_size (GstBuffer * buffer){
  ...
  len = GST_BUFFER_MEM_LEN (buffer);
  for (i = 0, size = 0; i < len; i++)
    size += GST_BUFFER_MEM_PTR (buffer, i)->size;
  return size;
}

```
#### Impact

This vulnerability can result in a Denial of Service (DoS) by triggering a segmentation fault (SEGV).

The unstable 1.25 release series is for testing and development purposes in the lead-up to the stable 1.26 series which is scheduled for release ASAP. Any newly-added API can still change until that point.  This development release is primarily for developers and early adopters.  The plan is to get 1.26 out of the door as quickly as possible.  Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows will be made available shortly at the [usual location](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/pkg/).

The applications it supports range from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing.  Applications can take advantage of advances in codec and filter technology transparently. Developers can add new codecs and filters by writing a simple plugin with a clean, generic interface. [Read more ...](features/index.html)  GStreamer is released under the LGPL. The 1.x series is API and ABI stable and supersedes the previous stable 0.10 series. Both can be installed in parallel. | [gst-player gtk+ backend playing Sintel](/data/images/gtk-play-sintel.png) | | --- | --- | |  |
