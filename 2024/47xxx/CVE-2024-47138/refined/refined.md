The provided content is related to CVE-2024-47138.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The administrative interface of mySCADA myPRO Manager listens on all interfaces on a TCP port and does not require authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306). The administrative interface lacks authentication, allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to gain full control over the affected system. This includes potentially executing arbitrary code, modifying configurations, or disrupting operations, resulting in high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the TCP port where the administrative interface of the myPRO Manager is listening, and no authentication is required.
