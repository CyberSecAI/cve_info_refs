## Coordinated Disclosure Timeline

* 2024-09-26: Issue reported at https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/issues/3847
* 2024-09-27: Issue acknowledged
* 2024-12-03: [Fixed and disclosed](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/security/sa-2024-0012.html)

## Project

Gstreamer

## Tested Version

* Development version (2024/09/25)

## Details

### OOB-read in qtdemux\_parse\_samples (`GHSL-2024-245`)

An OOB-read has been detected in the function [qtdemux\_parse\_samples](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/blob/a8f8bbef99e28bbf62aeaa774814b5c3a665e9d6/subprojects/gst-plugins-good/gst/isomp4/qtdemux.c#L10475) within `qtdemux.c`.

This issue arises when the function `qtdemux_parse_samples` reads data beyond the boundaries of the [stream->stco](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/blob/a8f8bbef99e28bbf62aeaa774814b5c3a665e9d6/subprojects/gst-plugins-good/gst/isomp4/qtdemux.c#L10252) buffer.

The following code snippet shows the call to [qt\_atom\_parser\_get\_offset\_unchecked](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/blob/a8f8bbef99e28bbf62aeaa774814b5c3a665e9d6/subprojects/gst-plugins-good/gst/isomp4/qtdemux.c#L10606), which leads to the OOB-read when parsing the provided `GHSL-2024-245_crash1.mp4` file:

```
static gboolean qtdemux_parse_samples (GstQTDemux * qtdemux, QtDemuxStream * stream, guint32 n){
...
        cur->offset =
            qt_atom_parser_get_offset_unchecked (&stream->co_chunk,
            stream->co_size);

```
#### Impact

This issue may lead to read up to 8 bytes out-of-bounds.

## CVE

* CVE-2024-47597

## Credit

This issue was discovered and reported by GHSL team member [@antonio-morales (Antonio Morales)](https://github.com/antonio-morales).

The applications it supports range from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing.  Applications can take advantage of advances in codec and filter technology transparently. Developers can add new codecs and filters by writing a simple plugin with a clean, generic interface. [Read more ...](features/index.html)  GStreamer is released under the LGPL. The 1.x series is API and ABI stable and supersedes the previous stable 0.10 series.

Subject: [PATCH 05/12] qtdemux: Make sure only an even number of bytes is
processed when handling CEA608 data
An odd number of bytes would lead to out of bound reads and writes, and doesn't
make any sense as CEA608 comes in byte pairs.
Strip off any leftover bytes and assume everything before that is valid.
Thanks to Antonio Morales for finding and reporting the issue.

Subject: [PATCH 09/12] qtdemux: Make sure there are enough offsets to read
when parsing samples
While this specific case is also caught when initializing co\_chunk, the error
is ignored in various places and calling into the function would lead to out of
bounds reads if the error message doesn't cause the pipeline to be shut down
fast enough.
To avoid this, no matter what, make sure enough offsets are available when
parsing them. While this is potentially slower, the same is already done in the
non-chunks\_are\_samples case.
Thanks to Antonio Morales for finding and reporting the issue.

Subject: [PATCH 10/12] qtdemux: Actually handle errors returns from various
functions instead of ignoring them
Ignoring them might cause the element to continue as if all is fine despite the
internal state being inconsistent. This can lead to all kinds of follow-up
issues, including memory safety issues.
