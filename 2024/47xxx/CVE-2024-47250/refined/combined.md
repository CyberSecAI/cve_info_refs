 advertising report could lead to potential out-of-bound access

Severity: low

Affected versions:

- Apache NimBLE through 1.7.0

Description:

Missing proper validation of HCI advertising report could lead to out-of-bound access when parsing HCI event and thus bogus GAP 'device found' events being sent.
This issue requires broken or bogus Bluetooth controller and thus severity is considered low.
This issue affects Apache NimBLE: through 1.7.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.8.0, which fixes the issue.
