The provided content is related to CVE-2024-47190.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Mender Enterprise Server, specifically in its hosted version, had insufficient validation of URLs provided by users when configuring SAML/OIDC settings. This allowed the server to make HTTP requests to arbitrary URLs specified by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): The application makes HTTP requests to URLs provided by the user without proper validation, allowing the attacker to potentially control the destination of these requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with administrative access could manipulate the Mender backend to make internal HTTP requests to unintended destinations. This could potentially affect other tenants in a multi-tenant environment.
- Although no effective way to exploit the vulnerability was discovered, the potential for internal API access exists.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated administrator with the ability to change SAML or OIDC settings.
- The attacker would inject a malicious URL into the SAML/OIDC configuration.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have administrative access within a Mender hosted environment and specifically the ability to modify SSO settings.
