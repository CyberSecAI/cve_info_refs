- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds read, specifically CWE-125.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit can lead to a memory leak.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning an attacker needs local access to the system. The attack requires user interaction (UI:R).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have local access to the system and must trick the user into triggering the vulnerability by opening a malicious file. No privileges are required (PR:N). The scope is unchanged (S:U) with confidentiality impact being high (C:H), and no impact on integrity (I:N) or availability (A:N).
