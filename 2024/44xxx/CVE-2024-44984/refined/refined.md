The provided content relates to CVE-2024-44984.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a double DMA unmapping in the `bnxt_en` driver's XDP_REDIRECT code path. Specifically, the `dma_unmap_page_attrs()` function was called even after the page pool started managing the DMA mapping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Double DMA unmapping

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The double unmapping triggers a warning in the kernel, specifically at `drivers/iommu/dma-iommu.c:1198`.
- It can lead to undefined behavior or system instability due to the incorrect memory management.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered when an XDP_REDIRECT operation is performed on a frame received by the `bnxt_en` driver.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to trigger the XDP_REDIRECT functionality within the network stack, which could happen if they have control over network traffic that reaches the vulnerable system.
