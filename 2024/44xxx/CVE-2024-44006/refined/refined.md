Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, leading to a Broken Access Control issue. This allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to higher privileged users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The plugin fails to properly validate user privileges before allowing access to certain functionalities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with low privileges (e.g., a subscriber role) could potentially execute higher privileged actions. The specific impact can vary depending on the vulnerable function.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a function within the plugin that lacks proper access control checks.
- The specific function is not mentioned.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a subscriber or have an even lower level of privilege.
- No other special capabilities or specific location is mentioned.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is considered to be of low priority with a CVSS score of 4.3,
*   A virtual patch has been issued by Patchstack to mitigate this vulnerability until the plugin is updated to version 5.3.7.
