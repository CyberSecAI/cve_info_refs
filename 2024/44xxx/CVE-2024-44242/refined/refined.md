- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An issue within `IOMobileFrameBuffer` related to bounds checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper bounds checking.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker may be able to cause unexpected system termination or achieve arbitrary code execution in DCP firmware.
- **Attack vectors**:  The specific attack vector is not detailed, but it involves an issue within the IOMobileFrameBuffer component.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires the ability to trigger the vulnerability within the IOMobileFrameBuffer which implies an existing attack vector or a malicious app capable of triggering the issue.
