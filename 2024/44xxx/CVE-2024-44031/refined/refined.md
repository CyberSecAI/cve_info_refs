- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows unprivileged users to perform actions that should require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control, specifically a lack of proper checks that result in the ability for lower privileged users to execute higher privileged actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The impact varies on a case-by-case basis as the specific actions that can be performed are not specified.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the vulnerable function where access controls are not properly implemented.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a subscriber on the WordPress site.
