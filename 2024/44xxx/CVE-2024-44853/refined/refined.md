```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `action_server_->get_current_goal()` method could return a null pointer if the action server is inactive, leading to a null pointer dereference when accessing the `controller_id` member.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A crash of the `nav2_controller` process due to a segmentation fault (SEGV).",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during the `computeControl()` function within `nav2_controller` when a goal is received by the action server and it's then deactivated/cleaned up during the computeControl call stack.",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send a goal to the action server and then interrupt or stop the process during goal processing to trigger the cleanup sequence."
