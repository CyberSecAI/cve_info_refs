CVE: CVE-2024-44852
Description: The vulnerability occurs due to an invalid pointer being accessed during the `isUnsafeToPlan()` calculation within the `nav2_theta_planner`. This happens because the `costmap_ros_` object, which is accessed during planning, can be shutdown earlier than the planner, leading to a use-after-free condition and a segmentation fault.
Root cause:  The `nav2_theta_star_planner` accesses the `costmap_ros_` object, which might be shutdown earlier, resulting in a use-after-free.
Weaknesses:
  - Use-after-free: The planner attempts to access memory associated with the costmap after it has been deallocated.
Impact:
  - Segmentation fault: A crash due to accessing invalid memory, leading to denial of service.
Attack vectors:
  - Triggering a planning operation during the shutdown phase of the navigation system.
Required attacker capabilities:
  - Ability to trigger a planning action while the costmap is shutting down.
