{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from a race condition during the shutdown of the `costmap_ros_` node in the ROS2 navigation2 stack. When the `costmap_ros_` node shuts down earlier than other nodes that depend on it, these nodes might still attempt to access the costmap, leading to a null pointer dereference.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition during node shutdown",
      "Null pointer dereference",
        "Improper resource handling during shutdown"
    ],
    "impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is a crash or unexpected behavior of the navigation system due to a null pointer dereference in the `findCircumscribedCost` function of `nav2_smac_planner` during planning, specifically when accessing the costmap, leading to a segmentation fault and termination of the navigation stack.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Triggering a planning action during the shutdown process.",
          "Concurrency issues due to race condition during shutdown."
      ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to launch and control ROS2 navigation2 stack components.",
        "Ability to trigger a planning action while the costmap is in a shutdown state"
    ],
    "additional_notes": "The fix involves ensuring that nodes depending on the `costmap_ros_` shut down properly by having the `costmap_2d_ros` node act as a child lifecycle node. This means the lifecycle transitions of the costmap node is dependent on the parent lifecycle node.",
      "affected_components": [
          "nav2_smac_planner",
          "nav2_costmap_2d",
          "nav2_planner"
      ]
