{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Broken Access Control",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An unprivileged user could execute higher-privileged actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker would need to find a function lacking proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks and then exploit it by sending a crafted request.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be a subscriber on the WordPress site. No further capabilities are explicitly defined, implying the exploit would likely rely on the vulnerable function's design and exposed parameters."
