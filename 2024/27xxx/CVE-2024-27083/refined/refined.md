Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the OAuth login page template. Specifically, the `next` parameter obtained from the request arguments was being directly embedded into the HTML without encoding, which could lead to execution of arbitrary javascript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- The `request.args.get('next', '') | safe` construct in the original code was marked as safe by the templating engine, indicating that it should not be escaped.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code, which would execute within the context of the user's browser when they visited the crafted URL. This could lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Data theft
  - Defacement
  - Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick the user into visiting it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL that contains the payload within the `next` parameter.
- The attacker needs to be able to get a user to visit the malicious URL (e.g., through phishing or other social engineering techniques).

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Flask-AppBuilder versions 4.1.4 up to and including 4.2.0.
- The vulnerability was introduced in version 4.1.4 and patched in version 4.2.1.
- The fix involved removing the `| safe` filter from the `request.args.get('next', '')` part of the template. This will force the template engine to escape the user-controlled data.
- The GitHub Security Advisory for this issue is GHSA-fqxj-46wg-9v84
- The CVSS score is 4.3 (Moderate) with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N.
