  "vulnerability_information": {
    "vulnerability_details": "SUPERAntiSpyware Professional X 10.0.1262 is vulnerable to local privilege escalation. An unprivileged user can restore a malicious DLL from quarantine to the installation directory (C:\\Program Files\\SUPERAntiSpyware) by using an NTFS directory junction.  The vulnerability is triggered because SASCore64.exe is vulnerable to DLL hijacking for version.dll. This allows an attacker to obtain a shell with NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM privileges after a system reboot.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the combination of an NTFS directory junction manipulation to control the restore location of a quarantined DLL file, and a DLL hijacking vulnerability within the SASCore64.exe process that is part of SUPERAntiSpyware.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Local Privilege Escalation",
      "DLL Hijacking",
      "NTFS directory junction manipulation"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution with NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM privileges, giving the attacker full control over the system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access",
      "NTFS directory junction",
      "DLL replacement"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to create directories, files, and NTFS directory junctions on the local machine. They also need to be able to cause SUPERAntiSpyware to quarantine their crafted malicious DLL file."

    "affected_versions": "<=10.0.1262 and latest version 10.0.1264",
    "operating_system": "All supported Windows versions, tested on Windows 10 Pro",
    "disclosure_date": "03.04.2024",
    "mitigations": "No official fix is available, uninstallation of SUPERAntiSpyware is recommended until the vulnerability is fixed.",
    "timeline": "Vulnerability reported via email on 18.02.2024, but vendor refused to fix it, leading to public disclosure on 03.04.2024.",
    "poc_details": [
      "Create a malicious version.dll containing shellcode.",
      "Combine version.dll with another malicious file in a .zip to ensure detection by SUPERAntiSpyware.",
      "Copy the crafted version.dll into a new folder, then scan the folder to trigger quarantine of the DLL.",
      "Use CreateMountPoint.exe (or mklink) to mount a directory junction at C:\\Program Files\\SUPERAntiSpyware, pointing to the quarantine location of version.dll.",
       "Restore the quarantined version.dll, which will place it in the SUPERAntiSpyware install directory.",
      "Reboot the system, causing SASCore64.exe to load and execute the malicious version.dll, thus running the attacker's shellcode with SYSTEM privileges."
