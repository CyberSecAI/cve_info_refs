The content is related to CVE-2024-27712.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Flaws in the sign-up process allow manipulation of account settings during registration, leading to user enumeration.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: User enumeration through observable discrepancies in the application's response to sign-up attempts. Specifically, the application provides explicit error messages indicating when a username is already in use, allowing an attacker to enumerate valid usernames.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can identify valid usernames. This information, combined with other vulnerabilities (like CVE-2024-27710), can lead to privilege escalation and potentially full admin access.
- **Attack vectors**: Attackers can manipulate the sign-up process to probe for existing usernames.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the sign-up functionality of the Eskooly web application. They do not need prior authentication to enumerate users.
