A vulnerability has been identified in SINEC INS (All versions < V1.0 SP2 Update 3). The affected application does not properly invalidate sessions when the associated user is deleted or disabled or their permissions are modified. This could allow an authenticated attacker to continue performing malicious actions even after their user account has been disabled.
