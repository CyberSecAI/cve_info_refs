- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Mender server's REST APIs for SAML and OIDC improperly handle user-supplied URLs. Specifically, the backend makes HTTP requests based on user input without sufficient validation, including following redirects.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The APIs fail to restrict the target of HTTP requests made by the server, allowing an attacker to potentially force the server to make requests to internal endpoints.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - An attacker with admin-level access could potentially make internal API GET requests within the Mender backend.
    - In a multi-tenant setup, a malicious user could try to gain unauthorized access or affect other tenants/organizations by targeting internal APIs.

- **Attack vectors**:
    - The attacker needs to have authenticated admin-level access to change SSO (SAML/OIDC) settings.
    - They inject malicious URLs into the SAML/OIDC configuration that the backend server will process.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker must have valid administrator credentials to access the Mender UI or API and modify SSO configuration.
    - The attacker must be able to manipulate the SAML/OIDC settings to insert attacker-controlled URLs.
