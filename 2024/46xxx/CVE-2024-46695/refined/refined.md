Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commits:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the usage of `__vfs_setxattr_noperm()` in the `selinux_inode_setsecctx` and `smack_inode_setsecctx` hooks within the Linux kernel's security modules (SELinux and Smack). The `__vfs_setxattr_noperm()` function, as its name implies, does not perform permission checks, relying on the caller to do so. The `nfsd_setattr()` function, which calls these hooks, performs its own permission checks via `fh_verify()` and `nfsd_permission()`, but these checks were not comprehensive enough to match the checks performed by the security modules. This led to a bypass of security label setting restrictions on NFS filesystems with root squashing enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Permission Checking:** The core weakness was the incomplete permission checks within the `nfsd_setattr()` function. It failed to properly validate security label changes, leading to an exploitable bypass.
- **Incorrect `__vfs_setxattr_noperm()` Usage:** The use of `__vfs_setxattr_noperm()` in the security hooks, which explicitly states it assumes the caller will perform permission checks, while `nfsd_setattr` did not implement comprehensive checks created a bypass.
- **NFS Root Squashing Bypass:** Specifically, the vulnerability allowed a root user on an NFS client to modify security labels on files residing on an NFS server where root squashing was in effect.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Security Label Manipulation:** A malicious root user on an NFS client could alter security labels of files on the NFS server, despite the root squashing configuration.
- **Potential Privilege Escalation:** Manipulating security labels can potentially lead to privilege escalation or unauthorized access on the server.
- **Compromised Security Policies:** The ability to modify security labels undermines the security policies enforced by SELinux and Smack.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack vector is through the network, leveraging the NFS protocol.
- **NFS Client:** The attacker needs a root account on a client mounting an NFS share with root squashing enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Root Access on NFS Client:** The attacker needs to be root on a machine that is an NFS client.
- **NFS Mount:** The attacker needs to be able to mount the vulnerable NFS share from a server that is exported with root squashing enabled.
- **Knowledge of Security Labels:** While not strictly necessary, knowledge of security label structure and values would help the attacker exploit the vulnerability for a specific purpose.

**More Detail Than CVE Description:**

The provided content gives a much more granular explanation than a typical CVE description:

- The commit messages and code diffs explicitly mention the `__vfs_setxattr_noperm()` function's role, the lack of permission checks, and how it was replaced with `__vfs_setxattr_locked()`.
- The bug report link to the kernel bugzilla is also provided, providing more context and a specific example of where this vulnerability was discovered.
- It details the specific scenario with NFS root squashing where the bypass could be exploited.

In summary, the core issue is the bypass of security checks for setting security labels via NFS when root squashing is enabled, due to the incorrect use of `__vfs_setxattr_noperm` and incomplete checks in `nfsd_setattr()`.
