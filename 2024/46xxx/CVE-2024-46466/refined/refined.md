    - Rendering the host computer unavailable
    - Execution of programs with elevated privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Computer unavailability (Denial of Service)
    - Privilege escalation
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the machine
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs local access to the computer where ZONECENTRAL is installed.
    - No specific privileges are required
    - No user interaction is required.
