    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the PDF interpreter's handling of cross-reference (XRef) streams within PDF files. Specifically, the code doesn't properly validate the values in the 'W' array within the XRef stream. This array defines the size of fields within the stream, and if these values are too large, it can lead to a buffer overflow.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
        "Buffer overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "A buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious PDF file with a crafted XRef stream containing oversized values in its 'W' array.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to create or modify a PDF file. They also need the victim to process the crafted PDF file with a vulnerable version of Ghostscript."
    },
    "additional_information": {
      "details": "The fix involves adding a check to ensure that the values in the 'W' array are within the allowed range (0-8). Additionally, the `field_width` variable in `pdf_xref_stream_entries()` is updated to be a 64-bit integer to prevent the mismatch that led to the buffer overflow.",
