{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "An out-of-bounds read occurs in the `indexedbasecolor` function within the `psi/zcolor.c` file of Artifex Ghostscript when handling Indexed color spaces. This is caused by not validating the index value before using it to access color information, leading to a read beyond the allocated memory bounds.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can result in a denial of service (DoS) due to an application crash. While there is no confidentiality or integrity impact, the out-of-bounds read can cause the application to terminate unexpectedly.",
    "attack_vector": "Local. An attacker needs access to the system to exploit the vulnerability.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious PostScript file or another input that triggers the out-of-bounds read in `indexedbasecolor`. This can be achieved by manipulating the `index` value to be outside the valid range for the given color space. No specific privileges are needed, but the attacker needs to have a user interaction to process the malicious input through Ghostscript."
