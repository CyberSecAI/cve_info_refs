Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-46887:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The web server of affected SIMATIC S7-1500 CPUs does not properly authenticate user requests to the `/ClientArea/RuntimeInfoData.mwsl` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Authentication Bypass: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper authentication checks on the specified endpoint, allowing unauthorized access.
- Information Disclosure: Successful exploitation enables the attacker to obtain sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated remote attacker can gain knowledge about:
    - Current actual cycle times of the CPU
    - Configured maximum cycle times of the CPU
    - Configured maximum communication load of the CPU.
- This information could potentially be used for further malicious activities or to cause disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks: A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability over the network.
- The specific attack vector is accessing the `/ClientArea/RuntimeInfoData.mwsl` endpoint on the web server of affected devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to reach the web server of the affected device over the network.
- No authentication is needed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory provides a long list of specific affected SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU models and their respective firmware versions
- Some products have fixes available, while others do not have fixes available yet
- Workarounds and mitigations are referenced but not specified in this document, deferring to the "Affected Products and Solution" section of the advisory.
- Siemens acknowledges Corstiaan Klos for reporting the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel.
