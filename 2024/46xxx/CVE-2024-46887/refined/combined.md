SUMMARY

Several SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU versions are affected by an authentication bypass vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to gain knowledge about actual and configured maximum cycle times and communication load of the CPU.

Siemens has released new versions for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions. Siemens is preparing further fix versions and recommends countermeasures for products where fixes are not, or not yet available.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.
Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity>

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC Drive Controllers have been designed for the automation of production machines, combining the functionality of a SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU and a SINAMICS S120 drive control.

SIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller is a PC-based version of the SIMATIC S7-1500 Controller including optional visualization in combination with central I/Os in a compact device.

SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU products have been designed for discrete and continuous control in industrial environments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

The SIMATIC S7-1500 MFP CPUs provide functionality of standard S7-1500 CPUs with the possibility to run C/C++ Code within the CPU-Runtime for execution of own functions / algorithms implemented in C/C++ and an additional second independent runtime environment to execute C/C++ applications parallel to the STEP 7 program if required.

SIMATIC S7-1500 Software Controller is a SIMATIC software controller for PC-based automation solutions.

SIMATIC S7-PLCSIM Advanced simulates S7-1200, S7-1500 and a few other PLC derivatives. Includes full network access to simulate the PLCs, even in virtualized environments.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2024-46887

The web server of affected devices do not properly authenticate user request to the '/ClientArea/RuntimeInfoData.mwsl' endpoint. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to gain knowledge about current actual and configured maximum cycle times as well as about configured maximum communication load.
