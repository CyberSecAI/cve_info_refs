A vulnerability has been identified in SINEC INS (All versions < V1.0 SP2 Update 3). The affected application uses hard-coded cryptographic key material to obfuscate configuration files. This could allow an attacker to learn that cryptographic key material through reverse engineering of the application binary and decrypt arbitrary backup files.
