  "CVE-2024-46889": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses hard-coded cryptographic key material.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can learn the cryptographic key material by reverse engineering the application binary and then decrypt arbitrary backup files.",
    "Attack vectors": "Reverse engineering of the application binary.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "No specific capabilities or positions are mentioned, but the attacker would need to be able to access and analyze the application binary."
