Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-46951 and CVE-2024-46956:

**CVE-2024-46951**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** An unchecked `Implementation` pointer in the Pattern color space in `psi/zcolor.c`.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  An unchecked pointer dereference, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Attack vectors:** Local attack vector requiring user interaction (opening a specially crafted PostScript or PDF file).
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  Attacker needs to entice a user to process a malicious file locally on a system running a vulnerable version of Ghostscript.

**CVE-2024-46956**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds data access in `filenameforall` in `psi/zfile.c`.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vectors:** Local attack vector requiring user interaction.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to convince a user to process a file with a crafted filename format string on a system running a vulnerable version of Ghostscript.

**Additional Observations:**

*   **SUSE's response:** SUSE has issued security advisories (`SUSE-SU-2024:3941-1` and `SUSE-SU-2024:3942-1`) to address both vulnerabilities, providing updated `ghostscript` packages for various SUSE products.
*   **CVSS Scores:** Both CVEs have a CVSS v3 base score of 7.8, indicating a high severity.
*   **Upstream fix:** The vulnerabilities are fixed in Artifex Ghostscript version 10.04.0 and later.
*   **Mitigation:** Users should update to the latest version of Ghostscript or apply the security patches from their Linux distribution.

**Summary of Common Points**

*   Both CVEs are present in Artifex Ghostscript.
*   Both CVEs involve arbitrary code execution.
*   Both CVEs have a local attack vector requiring user interaction to exploit.
*   Both CVEs are rated as important/high severity by SUSE and have a base CVSS score of 7.8.
*   Both CVEs are fixed in Ghostscript version 10.04.0.
*   SUSE has released patches to address both CVEs.

**Additional Notes**
* The SUSE information pages provide detailed lists of affected products and package versions.
* The ghostscript documentation provides technical information about the software, its usage and the supported command line options and devices.
* The patch information indicates a shared fix for both vulnerabilities as well as CVE-2024-46953 and CVE-2024-46955.
* There are links provided to view the commit diffs for the fixes in the upstream repository.
*   There's mention of the change in behavior of device selection that requires the `--permit-devices` option to authorize additional devices.
