  "CVE-2024-46888": {
    "Root cause": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided paths during SFTP file transfers.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
    ],
    "Impact": "An authenticated remote attacker can manipulate arbitrary files on the filesystem and achieve arbitrary code execution on the device.",
    "Attack vectors": "SFTP-based file up- and downloads.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Requires an authenticated user with remote access."
  },
   "CVE-2024-46889": {
    "Root cause": "The application uses hard-coded cryptographic keys for configuration file obfuscation.",
    "Weaknesses": [
       "Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can learn the cryptographic key through reverse engineering and decrypt arbitrary backup files.",
    "Attack vectors": "Reverse engineering of the application binary.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "Requires no authentication and has access to the application binary."
  },
   "CVE-2024-46890": {
    "Root cause": "The application does not properly validate input sent to specific web API endpoints.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')"
    ],
     "Impact": "An authenticated remote attacker with high privileges can execute arbitrary code on the underlying OS.",
    "Attack vectors": "Specific endpoints of the web API.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Requires an authenticated user with high privileges and remote access."

     "Root cause": "The application does not restrict the size of generated log files.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
    ],
    "Impact": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can exhaust system resources, causing a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "Triggering a large number of logged events.",

    "CVE-2024-46892": {
     "Root cause": "The application does not invalidate sessions when a user is disabled, deleted, or their permissions are modified.",
    "Weaknesses": [
       "Insufficient Session Expiration"
    ],
    "Impact": "An authenticated attacker can continue malicious actions even after their account is disabled.",
      "Attack vectors": "Maintaining an active session after account modification.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "Requires an authenticated user that had their account modified, and can still use an old session."
    },
    "CVE-2024-46894": {
    "Root cause": "The application does not validate authorization to query the `/api/sftp/users` endpoint.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
    ],
    "Impact": "An authenticated remote attacker can gain knowledge of the SFTP user list and modify its configuration.",
