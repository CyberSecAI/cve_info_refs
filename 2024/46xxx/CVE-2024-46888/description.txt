A vulnerability has been identified in SINEC INS (All versions < V1.0 SP2 Update 3). The affected application does not properly sanitize user provided paths for SFTP-based file up- and downloads. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker to manipulate arbitrary files on the filesystem and achieve arbitrary code execution on the device.
