- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly validate input sent to specific endpoints of its web API.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation, leading to OS command injection
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated remote attacker with high privileges on the application can execute arbitrary code on the underlying OS.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access to the vulnerable web API endpoints.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Authenticated with high privileges on the application.
