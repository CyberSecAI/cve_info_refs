Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-46624:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper authorization checks on the `/api/users` endpoint. This allows an authenticated user to modify their roles and escalate their privileges.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The application fails to verify if the authenticated user is authorized to modify user roles, specifically to escalate their privileges to "Glavni administrator."
- **Unrestricted API access:** The `/api/users` endpoint allows modification of sensitive user data including roles, without proper authorization checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with low-privileged user credentials can escalate their privileges to "Glavni administrator" level. This grants them full control over the application.
- **Complete System Takeover**: This level of access allows the attacker to perform actions as an admin, including but not limited to modifying/deleting data, changing settings, adding new users with admin privileges, and further attacking the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploited through network requests sent to the `/api/users` endpoint.
- **Authentication required:** The attacker needs valid credentials for a low-privileged account on the target application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated user:** The attacker needs to have a valid account with low-level privileges.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the `/api/users` endpoint.
- **Knowledge of API endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the API endpoint (`/api/users`) and the format of the request payload required to change user roles.

**Technical details:**
- The vulnerability resides in the InfoDom Performa 365 v4.0.1 application.
- The attacker must first log in as a low-privileged user and obtain the JWT (JSON Web Token).
- Then, a crafted request is sent to the `/api/users` endpoint, including user data and setting `roles` to "Glavni administrator."
- Upon refreshing the original session, the attacker gains administrative privileges.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided information states that the vulnerability is part of a larger lack of authorization vulnerability, affecting multiple endpoints.
- All vulnerabilities have been remediated, according to the text.
- A Burp request is mentioned in the report, which likely provides additional information on exploitation.
