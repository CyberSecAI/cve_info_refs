Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a SQL Injection vulnerability present in the administrative features of Veritas/Arctera Data Insight. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to manipulate the structure of SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it does not neutralize special elements used in SQL commands. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can submit arbitrary SQL commands to the backend database.
*   This could lead to the attacker being able to:
    *   Create, read, update, or delete data stored in the database
    *   Potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or modify the system's state.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is located within the administrative features of the application accessible via the web console.
*   The attacker modifies the syntax of a SQL query to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have the role of Application Administrator. This role allows the user to browse the database through the web console, which is necessary to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.
*   Network access to the vulnerable application.

**Affected Versions:**

* Veritas / Arctera Data Insight versions 6.3, 6.3.1, 6.4, 6.4.1, 6.5, 6.5.1, 6.5.2, 6.6, 6.6.1, 6.6.2, 7.0, 7.0.1 and 7.1.

**Mitigation:**

* Upgrade to Veritas / Arctera Data Insight version 7.1.1 or later.
