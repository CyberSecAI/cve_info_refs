- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds read in the `isp` component due to a missing bounds check.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local denial of service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation requires a malicious actor to have already obtained system privileges, and user interaction is needed for the exploit to work.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have system privileges and be able to trigger the vulnerable code path with user interaction.
