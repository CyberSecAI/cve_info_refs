Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-20476:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of server-side validation of administrator permissions in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE). Specifically, the system does not properly verify if an authenticated user has the necessary privileges to perform certain file management actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authorization Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability of an attacker to bypass authorization checks meant to restrict access to specific file management functions.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The vulnerability indicates a lack of proper validation of user-supplied input, specifically related to administrator permissions for file management tasks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized File Uploads:** A successful exploit could allow a remote, authenticated attacker to upload files to restricted locations on the system. This could lead to further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attack can be carried out remotely over a network.
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by submitting a crafted HTTP request to the affected system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be a valid user of the system.
- **Read-Only Administrator Credentials:** The attacker must have valid Read-Only Administrator credentials in order to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is present in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE.
- There are no workarounds to mitigate this issue; users must upgrade their software.
- The CVSS base score is 4.3, with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N, indicating a medium severity vulnerability.
