The vulnerability stems from the fact that Access Control List (ACL) deny rules are not properly enforced on Cisco Nexus 3550-F switches during device reboot. This means that after a reboot, the device may temporarily fail to block traffic as intended by the configured ACL rules.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper enforcement of ACL deny rules during device reboot.
- ACL bypass vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker could send traffic to the management interface of an affected device that should otherwise be blocked by ACLs.
- The attacker may gain unauthorized access to the management interface.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attack over the network.
- The attacker sends traffic that would typically be blocked to the management interface of the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to reach the management interface of the vulnerable Cisco Nexus 3550-F switch over the network.
- No authentication is required.
- The attacker does not need special privileges.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Cisco Nexus 3550-F Switches.
- Cisco NX-OS software is not affected.
- There are no workarounds to address this vulnerability; a software update is required.
- The vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
