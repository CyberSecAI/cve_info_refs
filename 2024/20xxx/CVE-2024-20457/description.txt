A vulnerability in the logging component of Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM &amp; Presence Service (Unified CM IM&amp;P) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view sensitive information in clear text on an affected system.

This vulnerability is due to the storage of unencrypted credentials in certain logs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the logs on an affected system and obtaining credentials that they may not normally have access to. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive information from the device.
