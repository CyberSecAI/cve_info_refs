{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the block length of a RARVM filter used for Intel E8 preprocessing.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient bounds checks on the block length of a RARVM filter",
      "Integer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution in the context of the application using the vulnerable library.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Enticing a target user into extracting a crafted RAR archive."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious RAR archive containing a specific RARVM filter with its 5th register set to 4. The user must then be enticed to extract this archive."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "rarvm_details": "The vulnerability stems from how libarchive handles legacy RARVM filters. These filters are essentially bytecode programs embedded in the archive that perform preprocessing on data. The 'e8' filter, used for optimizing x86 code, fails to properly validate a length parameter. Specifically, when the 5th register of the filter is set to 4, the loop condition within the execute_filter_e8 function will cause an integer overflow resulting in out-of-bounds memory access during decompression.",
    "affected_code": "The vulnerability is located in the `execute_filter_e8()` function within libarchive, specifically in the way it uses the block length parameter.",
        "detection": "The detection guidance is provided which involves parsing RAR files and checking the bytecode for specific CRC-32 checksums and register values within the filter. If a RARVM filter with a specific fingerprint (CRC-32 checksum of 0xAD576887 or 0x3CD7E57E) and the 5th register set to 4, is encountered, it should be considered suspicious."
