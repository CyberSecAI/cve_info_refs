The e8 thing is kinda interesting, but I think the ZDI description
didn't give enough background.

Here is my attempt:

    - A long time ago, WinRAR included a bytecode interpreting VM
      called RarVM. In theory, users could preprocess the data they're
      compressing to make it more compressible, and then embed "filters"
      in the archive. Those filters were little bytecode programs that
      reverse the preprocessing - and the decompressor would execute
      them (!!!).

      Kinda crazy, but I guess you could argue it's not that different
      to truetype hinting or postscript documents.

      I know about RarVM because I wrote an assembler for this format
      once (lol!) <https://github.com/taviso/rarvmtools>

    - You can't really use rarvm anymore, it was disabled in mainline
      rar a decade ago.

    - However...there were a few applications that were useful, like
      e8 processing. E8 processing makes x86 code more redundant (and
      therefore more compressible) by translating relative branches into
      absolute ones (e8 is the x86 opcode for a relative call). The
      decompressor can then reverse this process and get the original
      binary back.

    - So...libarchive checks if an archive is using once of those
      well-known bytecode programs and then emulates it. It checks by
      crc'ing the bytecode and checking if it recognizes the crc:

<https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/blob/master/libarchive/archive_read_support_format_rar.c#L3820>

      Seems a bit fragile, but okay.

    - You could optionally pass these rarvm filters "initial registers",
      effectively parameters to the bytecode programs. This is a bit
      like regparm in gcc (this is the READ_REGISTERS flag the ZDI article
      was talking about).

    - The e8 filter didn't validate the length parameter correctly,
      allowing the filter to effectively read and write the whole
      address space during decompression - oops.

I'm honestly not 100% sure it's correct now, it still looks fragile to
me. The audio filter should probably also have the number of channels
capped, to avoid DoS (I don't think it can corrupt memory though?).

<https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/blob/master/libarchive/archive_read_support_format_rar.c#L3750>

In my opinion as a RarVM expert (haha), I think it's not worth
supporting these old filters, were they really ever used in archives?

Tavis.

# CVE-2024-20697: Windows Libarchive Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

April 17, 2024 | Trend Micro Research Team

[SUBSCRIBE](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/rss/)

*In this excerpt of a Trend Micro Vulnerability Research Service vulnerability report, Guy Lederfein and Jason McFadyen of the Trend Micro Research Team detail a recently patched remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. This bug was originally discovered by the Microsoft Offensive Research & Security Engineering team. Successful exploitation could result in arbitrary code execution in the context of the application using the vulnerable library. The following is a portion of their write-up covering CVE-2024-20697, with a few minimal modifications.*

---

An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the Libarchive library included in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability is due to insufficient bounds checks on the block length of a RARVM filter used for Intel E8 preprocessing, included in the compressed data of a RAR archive.

A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by enticing a target user into extracting a crafted RAR archive. Successful exploitation could result in arbitrary code execution in the context of the application using the vulnerable library.

**The Vulnerability**

The RAR file format supports data compression, error recovery, and multiple volume spanning. Several versions of the RAR format exist: RAR1.3, RAR1.5, RAR2, RAR3, and the most recent version, RAR5. Different compression and decompression algorithms are used for different versions of RAR.

The following describes the RAR format used by versions 1.5, 2.x, and 3.x. A RAR archive consists of a series of variable-length blocks.

Each block begins with a header. The following table is the common structure of a RAR block header:

The *RarBlock Marker* is the first block of a RAR archive and serves as the signature of a RAR formatted file:

This block always contains the following byte sequence at the beginning of every RAR file:

`0x52 0x61 0x72 0x21 0x1A 0x07 0x00 (ASCII: "Rar!\x1A\x07\x00")`

The *ArcHeader* is the second block in a RAR file and has the following structure:

The *ArcHeader* block is followed by one or more *FileHeader* blocks. These blocks have the following structure:

Note that the above offsets are relative to the existence of the optional fields.

The *EndBlock* block will signify the end of the RAR archive. This block has the following structure:

For each *FileHeader* block in the RAR archive, if the *Method* field is not set to "Store" (`0x30`), then the Data field will contain the compressed file data. The method of decompression depends on the RAR version used to compress the data. The RAR version needed to extract the compressed data is recorded in the *UnpVer* field of the *FileHeader* block.

Of relevance to this report is the RAR extraction method used by RAR format version 2.9 (a.k.a. RAR4), which is used when the *UnpVer* field is set to 29. The compressed data may be compressed either using the Lempel-Ziv (LZ) algorithm or using Prediction by Partial Matching (PPM) compression. This report will not describe in full detail the extraction algorithm, but only summarize the relevant parts for understanding the vulnerability. For a reference implementation of the extraction algorithm, see the `Unpack::Unpack29()` function in the UnRAR [source code](https://www.rarlab.com/rar/unrarsrc-7.0.7.tar.gz).

When the libarchive library attempts to extract the contents of a file from a RAR archive, if the file data is compressed (i.e. the *Method* field is not set to "Store"), the function `read_data_compressed()` will be called to extract the compressed data. The compressed data is composed of multiple blocks, each of which can be compressed using the LZ algorithm (denoted by the first bit of the block set to 0) or using PPM compression (denoted by the first bit of the block set to 1). Initially, the function `parse_codes()` will be called to decode the tables necessary to extract the file data. If a block of data compressed using the LZ algorithm is encountered, the `expand()` function will be called to decompress the data. In the `expand()` function, symbols are read from the compressed data by calling `read_next_symbol()` in a loop. In the function `read_next_symbol()`, the symbol will be decoded according to the Huffman table decoded in function `parse_codes()`.

If the decoded symbol is 257, the function `read_filter()` will be called to read a RARVM filter, which has the following structure:

Note that the above offsets are relative to the existence of the optional fields.

The calculation of the size of the *Code* field is as follows: If the lowest 3 bits of the Flags field (will be referred to as *LENGTH*) are less than 6, the code size is (*LENGTH + 1*). If *LENGTH* is set to 6, the code size is (*LengthExt1 + 7*). If *LENGTH* is set to 7, the code size is `(LengthExt1 << 8) | LengthExt2`. After the code length is calculated and the code itself is copied into a buffer, the code, its length, and the filter flags are sent to the `parse_filter()` function to parse the code section.

Within the code section, numbers are parsed by calling the function `membr_next_rarvm_number()`. This function reads 2 bits, and according to their value, determines how many bits to read to parse the value. If the first 2 bits are 0, 4 value bits will be read; if they are 1, 8 value bits will be read; if they are 2, 16 value bits will be read; and
if they are 3, 32 value bits will be read.

Function `parse_filter()` will parse the code section, which has the following structure:

Note that if the *READ\_REGISTERS* flag is not set, the registers will be initialized, such that the 5th register is set to the block length, which is either read from the code section (if the *READ\_BLOCK\_LENGTH* flag is set), or carried over from the block length of the previous filter.

After these fields are parsed in `parse_filter()`, the *ByteCode* field and its length are sent to the function `compile_program()`. In this function, the first byte of the bytecode is verified to be equal to the XOR of all other bytes in the bytecode. If true, it will set the fingerprint field of the `rar_program_code` struct to the value of the CRC-32 algorithm run on the full bytecode, combined with the bytecode length shifted left 32 bits.

Back in the function `parse_filter()`, after all fields are calculated for the filter, the`rar_filter` struct will be initialized by calling `create_filter()` with the `rar_program_code` struct containing the fingerprint field and the register values calculated. These values will be set to the prog field and the *initialregisters* fields of the `rar_filter` struct, respectively.

Once processing of the filter is done, function `run_filters()` is called to run the parsed filter. This function initializes the *vm* field of the *rar\_filters* struct with a structure of type *rar\_virtual\_machine*. This structure contains a *registers* field, which is an array of 8 integers, and a memory field of size `0x40004`. Then, each filter is executed by calling `execute_filter()`. If the fingerprint field of the *rar\_program\_code* struct associated with the executed filter is equal to either `0x35AD576887` or `0x393CD7E57E`, the `execute_filter_e8()` function is called. This function reads the block length from the 5th field of the *initialregisters* array. Then, a loop is run for replacing instances of `0xE8` and/or `0xE9` within the *VM* memory, with the block length used as the loop exit condition.

An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the Libarchive library included in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability is due to insufficient bounds checks on the block length of a RARVM filter used for Intel E8 preprocessing, included in the compressed data of a RAR archive. Specifically, if the archive contains a RARVM filter whose *fingerprint* field is calculated as either `0x35AD576887` or `0x393CD7E57E`, it will be executed by calling `execute_filter_e8()`. If the 5th register of the filter is set to a block length of 4, the loop condition in this function, which is set to the block length minus 5, will overflow to `0xFFFFFFFF`. Since the VM memory has a size of `0x40004`, this will result in memory accesses that are out of the bounds of the heap-based buffer representing the VM memory.

A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by enticing a target user into extracting a crafted RAR archive, containing a RARVM filter that has its 5th register set to 4. Successful exploitation could result in arbitrary code execution in the context of the application using the vulnerable library.

Notes:

• All multi-byte integers are in little-endian byte order.
• All offsets and sizes are in bytes unless otherwise specified.
• Since there is no official documentation of the RAR4 format, the description is based on the UnRAR and libarchive source code. Field names are either copied from source code or given based on functionality.

**Detection Guidance**

To detect an attack exploiting this vulnerability, the detection device must monitor and parse traffic on the common ports where a RAR archive might be sent, such as FTP, HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, SMB, and POP3.

The detection device must look for the transfer of RAR files and be able to parse the RAR file format. Currently, there is no official documentation of the RAR file format. This detection guidance is based on the source code for extracting RAR archives provided by the *UnRAR* [program](https://www.rarlab.com/rar/unrarsrc-7.0.7.tar.gz) and the *libarchive* [library](https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive).

The common structure of a RAR block header is detailed above. The detection device must first look for a *RarBlock* Marker, which is the first block of a RAR archive and serves as the signature of a RAR formatted file:

The detection device can identify this block by looking for the following byte sequence:

`0x52 0x61 0x72 0x21 0x1A 0x07 0x00 ("Rar!\x1A\x07\x00")`

If found, the device must then identify the *ArcHeader*, which is the second block in a RAR file and is detailed above. The *ArcHeader* block is followed by one or more *FileHeader* blocks, whose structure is also detailed above. Note that the above offsets are relative to the existence of the optional fields.

The detection device must parse each *FileHeader* block and inspect its Method field. If the value of the Method field is greater than `0x30`, the detection device must inspect the Data field of the *FileHeader* block, containing the compressed file data. The compressed data may be compressed either using the Lempel-Ziv (LZ) algorithm or using *Prediction* by Partial Matching (PPM) compression. This detection guidance will not describe in full detail the extraction algorithm. For a reference implementation of the extraction algorithm, see the *Unpack::Unpack29()* function in the UnRAR source code.

The compressed data is composed of multiple blocks, each of which can be compressed using the LZ algorithm (denoted by the first bit of the block set to 0) or using PPM compression (denoted by the first bit of the block set to 1). The detection device must extract each block according to the algorithm used to compress it. If a block compressed using the LZ algorithm is encountered, the detection device must decode the Huffman tables from the beginning of the compressed data. The detection device must then iterate over the remaining compressed data and decode each symbol based on the generated Huffman tables. If the symbol 257 is encountered, the following data must be parsed as a RARVM filter, which has the following structure:

Note that the above offsets are relative to the existence of the optional fields.

The detection device must then calculate the size of the *Code* field. The calculation of the size of the *Code* field is as follows: If the lowest 3 bits of the Flags field (will be referred to as *LENGTH*) are less than 6, the code size is *(LENGTH + 1)*. If *LENGTH* is set to 6, the code size is *(LengthExt1 + 7)*. If *LENGTH* is set to 7, the code size is `(LengthExt1 << 8) | LengthExt2`. After the size of the *Code* field is calculated, the *Code* field must be parsed according to the following structure:

All numerical fields within this structure (*FilterNum*, *BlockStart*, *BlockLength*, register values, and *ByteCodeLen*) must be read according to the algorithm implemented in the `RarVM::ReadData()` function of the UnRAR source code. The algorithm reads 2 bits of data, signifying the number of bits of data containing the numerical value. Note that some of the fields in this structure are optional and depend on flags set in the *Flags* field of the RARVM filter structure.

After extracting all necessary fields, the detection device must check for the following conditions:

• The CRC-32 checksum of the *ByteCode* field is `0xAD576887` and the *ByteCodeLen* field is `0x35` OR the CRC-32 checksum of the *ByteCode* field is `0x3CD7E57E` and the *ByteCodeLen* field is `0x39`.
• The *READ\_REGISTERS* flag is set and the value of the 5th register of the *Registers* field is set to `4` OR the *READ\_BLOCK\_LENGTH* flag is set and the value of the *BlockLength* field is set to `4`. If both these conditions are met, the traffic should be considered suspicious. An attack exploiting this vulnerability is likely underway.

Notes:

• All multi-byte integers are in little-endian byte order.
• All offsets and sizes are in bytes unless otherwise specified.

**Conclusion**

Microsoft patched this vulnerability in January 2024 and assigned it [CVE-2024-20697](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-20697). While they did not recommend any mitigating factors, there are some additional measures you can take to help protect from this bug being exploited. This includes not extracting RAR archive files from untrusted sources and filtering traffic using the guidance provided in the section “Detection Guidance” section of this blog. Still, it is recommended to apply the vendor patch to completely address this issue.
