## About Managing FPGA/EPLD/BIOS Firmware

Cisco switches contain several programmable logical devices (PLDs) that provide hardware functionalities in all modules. PLDs
include electronic programmable logic devices (EPLDs) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Cisco provides periodic
PLD image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known issues.

In Cisco ACI, there is no need for you to manually manage FPGA/EPLD/BIOS firmware individually or explicitly. Instead, when ACI switches
are managed by APICs and the regular firmware upgrade is performed for switches through the APICs, the appropriate FPGA/EPLD/BIOS
firmware that is included in the ACI switch image itself (such as aci-n9000-dk9.14.2.1i.bin) will be automatically applied.

However, when a switch boots up with an ACI switch image without going through the upgrade triggered through the APICs, the
FPGA/EPLD/BIOS firmware running in the ACI switch will not be upgraded with the appropriate versions from the ACI switch image.
This may result in a mismatched FPGA/EPLD/BIOS version. This may occur on a switch if you received it through a new order,
Product Returns & Replacements (RMA), or when you convert the switch from standalone NX-OS software to ACI switch software.

Prior to Cisco APIC release 5.2(1) and ACI switch release 15.2(1), at such times, you had to downgrade the switch once and then perform the upgrade
to the desired version through the APICs in order to upgrade FPGA/EPLD/BIOS versions to the appropriate ones.

Starting from Cisco APIC release 5.2(1) and ACI switch release 15.2(1), ACI switches will automatically upgrade the FPGA/EPLD/BIOS based on the booting
ACI switch image during a normal boot up sequence for the following components, even if it’s not an upgrade operation performed
through the APICs:

* **Leaf switches and box-type spine switches**: EPLD/FPGA/BIOS is automatically upgraded on the switch itself
* **Modular-type spine switches**: EPLD/FPGA/BIOS is automatically upgraded on these components:

  + Supervisor module
  + Linecard module
  + Fabric module

When one of the supported components listed above boots up, the system automatically performs the following actions to determine
if the EPLD/FPGA/BIOS image is in sync with the Cisco ACI or NX-OS image:

1. The system compares the BIOS versions and performs an upgrade at the BIOS level if it finds that the images are out of sync.
2. The system compares the EPLD/FPGA versions and performs an upgrade at the EPLD/FPGA level if it finds that the images are
   out of sync.
3. If the system has to perform an upgrade at any of the levels (at the BIOS level or at the EPLD/FPGA level), the system then
   performs a power cycle on that component (the switch, supervisor module, linecard module, or fabric module).

These automatic FPGA/EPLD/BIOS upgrades during a normal boot up sequence is performed per component. For instance, when a
new linecard module is inserted and boots up with the base ACI switch image downloaded from the supervisor module, only the
new linecard module is power-cycled to apply the FPGA/EPLD/BIOS from the base ACI switch image. Other modules will not be
impacted.

## Guidelines and Restrictions When Managing FPGA/EPLD/BIOS Firmware

* Note the following component-specific considerations:

  + **For supervisor modules**: Because ACI switches operate in cold-standby, when the active supervisor module is reloaded, the entire box is reloaded.
    Therefore, when the FPGA/EPLD/BIOS upgrade during a normal boot up sequence is required for both active and standby supervisor
    modules or only for the active module, a power cycle will be performed on both the active and the standby supervisor module
    at the same time. If the FPGA/EPLD/BIOS upgrade is required only on the standby module, a power cycle will be performed only
    on the standby module and the active module will remain up and running.
  + **For system controllers**: The FPGA/EPLD/BIOS on the system controllers (SCs) on modular switches are not upgraded during the normal boot up sequence.
    If the EPLD/FPGA/BIOS version on the system controllers does not match with the base ACI switch image, you still need to perform
    an upgrade of the switch itself through the APICs.
* There are known Memory Technology Device (MTD) intermittent mount issues, where the automatic FPGA/EPLD/BIOS upgrades are
  not triggered on some linecard modules and fabric modules on certain MTD-based boards. If the Embedded MultiMediaCard (EMMC)
  or MTD has gone bad, the automatic FPGA/EPLD/BIOS upgrades will not get triggered.
* Entering the command `show system reset-reason` at the upper board level provides information on the reason for the reset when the automatic FPGA/EPLD/BIOS upgrades are
  triggered. However, entering the command at the linecard or fabric module level (for example, `show system reset-reason module 3`) does not produce any information.

Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases Resolution of this vulnerability requires a BIOS update on affected Cisco MDS, Nexus, and UCS Fabric Interconnect platforms that are running Cisco NX-OS Software.  To upgrade the BIOS on Cisco MDS and Nexus Standalone platforms, upgrade Cisco NX-OS Software on the affected devices with the **install all** CLI command or install a specific SMU as indicated in the Fixed Release table that follows. For more information, see the [Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Software Upgrade and Downgrade Guide, Release 10.4(x)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/dcn/nx-os/nexus9000/104x/upgrade/cisco-nexus-9000-series-nx-os-software-upgrade-and-downgrade-guide-104x/m-upgrading-or-downgrading-the-cisco-nexus-9000-series-nx-os-software.html).  For Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches in ACI mode, upgrade to a fixed software release as shown in the Fixed Release table that follows. For more information, see the [Cisco APIC Installation and ACI Upgrade and Downgrade Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/dcn/aci/apic/all/apic-installation-aci-upgrade-downgrade/Cisco-APIC-Installation-ACI-Upgrade-Downgrade-Guide/m-managing-fpga-epld-bios-firmware.html).  For Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect platforms, upgrade to a fixed software release as shown in the Fixed Release table that follows. For more information for devices managed by UCS Manager (UCSM), see the [Cisco UCS Manager Firmware Management Guide, Release 4.3](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/ucs/ucs-manager/GUI-User-Guides/Firmware-Mgmt/4-3/b_UCSM_GUI_Firmware_Management_Guide_4-3/b_UCSM_GUI_Firmware_Management_Guide_chapter_011.html). For more information for devices managed by Intersight, see the [Cisco Intersight Managed Mode Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/Intersight/b_Intersight_Managed_Mode_Configuration_Guide/m_review_map_firmware_management.html).  Cisco recommends verifying the BIOS version for each platform after the upgrade has been completed.  **Note:** For Cisco MDS and Nexus standalone platforms, if the device was not previously upgraded by using the **install all** CLI command, the BIOS might not have been upgraded. Even if customers are running a fixed Cisco NX-OS Software release, they are advised to check the BIOS version and use the **install all** command to complete the BIOS upgrade, if applicable.  In the following table, the left column lists Cisco MDS, Nexus, and UCS Fabric Interconnect platforms. The middle column indicates the first BIOS version that includes the fix for this vulnerability. The right column indicates the corresponding first Cisco NX-OS Software release or SMU or Cisco UCS Software release that incorporates the fixed BIOS version.       | Cisco MDS 9000 Series Multilayer

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

To create a notification, use the following steps:

1. Log in to the [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) on Cisco.com using a registered Cisco.com account name and password.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## Firmware Upgrade in a Cisco UCS Domain through Intersight

You can upgrade the firmware for various components in a Cisco UCS Domain through Cisco Intersight by choosing one of the
following upgrade options:

### Fabric Firmware Upgrade

Through this process, you can upgrade all the fabric components in a Cisco UCS Domain, including the two Fabric Interconnects
and I/O modules. These components are upgraded to the firmware version included in the selected fabric firmware bundle. Fabric
firmware upgrade does not support a partial upgrade to only some components in a Cisco UCS Domain. The fabric firmware upgrade
process is valid only for Cisco UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects.

Fabric firmware bundles are available in the Cisco Intersight repository and have two component images:

* NXOS image
* CMC image

The following workflow illustrates the fabric firmware upgrade process:

1. Fabric Selection: You can initiate the fabric firmware upgrade process by selecting a Fabric Interconnect and performing an Upgrade Firmware action on it. Fabric Interconnects are always upgraded as a pair, in which Fabric Interconnect-B is upgraded before Fabric
   Interconnect-A.
2. Bundle Selection: After you select the Fabric Interconnect pair to be upgraded, you must select the fabric firmware bundle to which the Fabric
   Interconnects need to be upgraded. The firmware selection screen displays a list of available firmware bundles and information
   about their firmware version, size, release date, and description. The selected firmware bundle is downloaded from the Cisco
   Intersight repository.
3. Impact Estimation: The Summary screen shows a summary of the selected switches, the firmware version running on them, and the firmware version
   to which they will be upgraded. You can choose to upgrade by clicking Upgrade, or change the configuration by clicking Back.
4. Upgrade Request Submission: After you click Upgrade, confirm the upgrade request.

The following workflow illustrates the tasks that occur automatically after you submit an upgrade request:

1. The system validates whether there is enough storage space for the firmware bundle. If the space on the Fabric Interconnect
   is insufficient, the upgrade fails.
2. The system checks whether the selected firmware bundle is already in the Fabric Interconnect cache. If the firmware bundle
   is not present, it is downloaded to the Fabric Interconnect cache.
3. Both the IO modules are updated and activated on all the connected chassis. IO module upgrade is completed when the IO modules
   are rebooted.
4. Click Continue to acknowledge and begin firmware upgrade on Fabric Interconnect-B. After Fabric Interconnect-B upgrade is complete, the
   Fabric Interconnect reboots and comes up with the new image. IOM-B is rebooted along with the Fabric Interconnect-B, and comes
   up with the upgraded image.
5. Click Continue to acknowledge and begin firmware upgrade on Fabric Interconnect-A. After Fabric Interconnect-A upgrade is complete, the
   Fabric Interconnect reboots and comes up with the new image. IOM-A is rebooted along with the Fabric Interconnect-A, and comes
   up with the upgraded image.

### Host Firmware Upgrade

Through this process, you can upgrade all the server components for Cisco UCS B-Series and C-Series FI-Attached servers that
are in Intersight Managed Mode. These components are upgraded to the firmware version included in the selected host firmware
bundle.

Server firmware bundles are available in the Cisco Intersight repository, and have the following component images:

* CIMC image
* BIOS image
* Network adapter image

  | **Note** | ---   Only UCS VIC 1400 Series adapters are supported.   --- |
  | --- | --- |
* Storage controller image
* Board controller image
* Disk image
* GPU image
* Memory card image
* M-Switch and PLX images

The following workflow illustrates the host firmware upgrade process.

1. Server Selection: You can initiate the host firmware upgrade process by selecting a server and performing an Upgrade Firmware action on it.
2. Bundle Selection: After you confirm the server to be upgraded, you must select the host firmware bundle to which the server needs to be upgraded.
   The firmware selection screen displays a list of available firmware bundles and information about their firmware version,
   size, release date, and description. The selected firmware bundle will be downloaded from the Cisco Intersight repository.
3. Impact Estimation: The Summary screen shows a summary of the selected server, the firmware version running on it, and the firmware version
   to which it will be upgraded. You can choose to upgrade by clicking Upgrade, or change the firmware version by clicking Back.
4. Upgrade Request Submission: After you click Upgrade, select whether you want the firmware to be installed immediately or when the device reboots. Confirm the upgrade request.

   By default, firmware will be installed on next boot of the device.

The following workflow illustrates the tasks that occur automatically after you submit an upgrade request:

1. The system validates whether there is enough storage space for the firmware bundle. If the space on the Fabric Interconnect
   is insufficient, the upgrade fails.
2. The system checks whether the selected firmware bundle is already in the Fabric Interconnect cache. If the firmware bundle
   is not present, it is downloaded to the Fabric Interconnect cache.
3. Server firmware is upgraded as follows:

   * For B-Series servers:

     1. Adapter firmware is updated and activated. Adapter upgrade is completed when the server is rebooted.
     2. The Host Service Utility (HSU) is upgraded immediately or when the server reboots.
     3. All server components are upgraded.
   * For C-Series servers:

     1. The HSU is upgraded immediately or when the server reboots.
     2. All server components are upgraded.
4. Click Continue to acknowledge and begin firmware upgrade.

## Upgrading Fabric Interconnect Firmware

You can upgrade Intersight managed Fabric Interconnect using Cisco Intersight.

### Before you begin

Before you upgrade your Intersight managed Fabric Interconnect firmware, consider the following prerequisites:

* Only Cisco UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects in a Cisco UCS Domain may be
  upgraded.
* You must have at least the following available storage in the Fabric
  Interconnect partitions for the firmware bundle to be downloaded:

  + 90 percent free space in /var/tmp
  + 20 percent free space in /var/sysmgr
  + 30 percent free space in /mnt/pss
  + 18 percent free space in /bootflash
* Only Cisco UCS Domains that are claimed through Intersight may be
  upgraded.
* All servers in the Cisco UCS Domain must be at license tier Essentials or
  above.

### Procedure

This page displays a list of available firmware bundles and information about their firmware version, size, release date, and description. The selected firmware bundle will be downloaded from the Intersight repository.  During upgrade of Intersight Managed Fabric Interconnect, the Fabric Interconnect traffic evacuation is enabled by default. Fabric Interconnect traffic evacuation evacuates all traffic that flows through the Fabric Interconnect from all servers attached to it, while upgrading the system. The traffic will fail over to the peer Fabric Interconnect for fail over vNICs. Before the traffic evacuation on a Fabric Interconnect, the user must acknowledge that replay on peer Fabric Interconnect is completed and all vEths are up. Use the *show interface virtual status* command to check the vEth status for respective vEth from NXOS.  Before the traffic evacuation, you can check the traffic flowing through the Fabric Interconnect by viewing the Transmit (Tx) and Receive (Rx) stats of Host Interfaces (HIFs). After the traffic evacuation, you can check the traffic flowing through the Fabric Interconnect (FI) by viewing the Transmit (Tx) and Receive (Rx) stats of Network Interfaces (NIFs).   | **Note** | For Fabric Interconnect traffic evacuation to be functional, vNIC failover must be enabled in the LAN Connectivity Policy | | --- | --- |   Select **Advanced Mode** to disable the Fabric Interconnect traffic evacuation. |
| **Step 5** | On the Summary screen, verify the summary of the selected switches, the firmware version running on them, and the firmware version to which they will be upgraded, and click Upgrade.  You can choose to change the firmware version by clicking Back. |
| **Step 6** | Confirm the upgrade request.  The firmware upgrade workflow begins. You can check the status of the upgrade workflow in the Execution Flow pane. Acknowledge any messages in the Execution Flow pane and click Continue to proceed with the upgrade. |

## Upgrading Server Firmware Using Firmware Policy

Perform the following steps to upgrade the server firmware using Firmware policy:

1. Create a Firmware policy as described in [Creating a Firmware Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/Intersight/b_Intersight_Managed_Mode_Configuration_Guide/b_intersight_managed_mode_guide_chapter_0110.html#creating-a-firmware-policy).
2. Attach the policy to the server profile of the server that needs to be upgraded.

   The profile status will change to 'Pending Changes'.
3. Deploy the profile.

   The firmware will be downloaded and prepared for upgrade upon the next reboot.

   The profile status will change to 'Pending Reboot'.
4. Reboot the server.

   The Activation workflow is triggered, and the firmware upgrade is monitored.

   After the successful upgrade, the profile status changes to 'OK'.

## Upgrades and Replacement of RMA Servers and Fabric Interconnects

### RMA Upgrades

RMA is a Return Material Authorization process that enhances customer experience.

Upgrade of RMA Server

The RMA process triggers an automatic discovery workflow when you insert a new blade server, or when you replace an old blade
server. The discovery workflow raises an alarm if the firmware of the blade server is outdated, and you will be asked to trigger
an upgrade workflow.

1. Go to Chassis > Inventory > Servers
2. Select the server that you want to upgrade
3. Click Upgrade.
4. Select the firmware version to which you want to upgrade the server.

Relevant endpoints like Cisco IMC and Adaptor are upgraded to ensure that the server comes up in the Intersight Managed Mode,
is available in the server list page, and is ready for use. You can upgrade the rest of the endpoints using the standard firmware
upgrade method

| **Note** | ---  The CMC version must be 4.1(3b) or later.  --- |
| --- | --- |

RMA support is not available for FI-attached C-Series servers in Intersight Managed Mode. You first need to convert the C-Series
server in IMM to Standalone mode, verify the firmware, and then upgrade using HUU.

To convert the server from IMM to Standalone, See [Converting a Server in Intersight Managed Mode to Standalone Mode](https://intersight.com/help/saas/resources/conversion_procedures#converting_a_server_in_intersight_managed_mode_to_standalone_mode).

To upgrade the firmware of C-Series Standalone server , See [Upgrading UCS C-Series Standalone Servers Firmware](https://intersight.com/help/saas/resources/Upgrading_UCS_C-Series_Standalone_Servers_Firmware).

Replacement of RMA Fabric Interconnect

When a single Fabric Interconnect, or a Fabric Interconnect cluster is faulty, and the Fabric Interconnects have been replaced
of the same model, you can use the Replace option for migrating the configuration of the old Fabric Interconnects to the new
ones. The workflows for replacing both a single Fabric Interconnect and a Fabric Interconnect cluster are detailed in the
subsequent paragraphs.

Replacement of Single Fabric Interconnect in Cisco UCS 6400 Series and 6500 Series Fabric Interconnects

1. Remove the old Fabric Interconnect and connect the new Fabric Interconnect of the same model.
2. Move all cable connections, including servers, FEX fabrics, and blade chassis, from the old Fabric Interconnect to the new
   Fabric Interconnect.
3. Configure the new module to join the cluster, before triggering the 'Replace' action.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

To create a notification, use the following steps:

1. Log in to the [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) on Cisco.com using a registered Cisco.com account name and password.

| **Additional Public Relations** | media\_pr@cisco.com |

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

Bias-Free Language

### Bias-Free Language

The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product.

## About the Software Image

Each device is shipped with the Cisco NX-OS software preinstalled. The Cisco NX-OS software consists of one NX-OS software
image. Only this image is required to load the Cisco NX-OS operating system.

Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.2(2)F all Cisco Nexus platforms operate only on two types of 64-bit images.

| **Note** | ---   The 32-bit image is no longer supported.   --- |
| --- | --- |

In Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(x), the following two 64-bit images are supported:

* The 64-bit Cisco NX-OS image file has a filename that begins with "nxos64-cs” as the prefix (for example, nxos64-cs.10.4.1.F.bin).
  This image is supported on all Cisco Nexus 9000 series fixed and modular switches except Cisco Nexus 9500 -R and -R2 switches
  and cards.
* The 64-bit Cisco NX-OS image file has a filename that begins with "nxos64-msll” (for example, nxos64-msll.10.4.1.F.bin). This
  image is supported on Cisco Nexus 9000 series -R and -R2 modular switches, Cisco Nexus 3600 series fixed switches, and Cisco Nexus 3500-XL switches.

For 32-bit or 64-bit image support on respective platforms through releases, see the relevant version of the Cisco Nexus 9000
Series Release Notes on [Cisco.com](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/switches/nexus-9000-series-switches/products-release-notes-list.html).

The Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches support disruptive software upgrades and downgrades by default.

| **Note** | ---   Another type of binary file is the software maintenance upgrade (SMU) package file. SMUs contain fixes for specific defects. They are created to respond to immediate issues and do not include new features. SMU package files are available for download from Cisco.com and generally include the ID number of the resolved defect in the filename (for example, n9000-dk10.1.1.**CSCab00001**.gbin). For more information on SMUs, see the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS System Management Configuration Guide.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   Cisco also provides electronic programmable logic device (EPLD) image upgrades to enhance hardware functionality or to resolve known hardware issues. The EPLD image upgrades are independent from the Cisco NX-OS software upgrades. For more information on EPLD images and the upgrade process, see the [Cisco Nexus 9000 Series FPGA/EPLD Upgrade Release Notes](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/switches/nexus-9000-series-switches/products-release-notes-list.html).   --- |

## About ISSU

An in-service software upgrade (ISSU) allows you to upgrade the device software while the switch continues to forward traffic.
ISSU reduces or eliminates the downtime typically caused by software upgrades. You can perform an ISSU, also known as a non-disruptive
upgrade, for some switches. (See the [ISSU Platform Support](#Cisco_Reference.dita_1bf58da2-f286-4909-a9a5-36ba84fc75b4) for a complete list of supported platforms.)

The default upgrade process is disruptive. Therefore, ISSU needs to be enabled using the command-line interface (CLI), as
described in the configuration section of this document. Using the non-disruptive option helps ensure a non-disruptive upgrade.
The guest shell is disabled during the ISSU process and it is later reactivated after the upgrade.

Enhanced ISSUs are supported for some Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches.

The following ISSU scenarios are supported:

* Performing standard ISSU on Top-of-Rack (ToR) switches with a single supervisor
* Performing enhanced ISSU on Top-of-Rack (ToR) switches with a single supervisor

### Performing Standard ISSU on Top-of-Rack (ToR) Switches with a Single Supervisor

The ToR Cisco Nexus 9300 platform switches are the NX-OS switches with single supervisors. Performing ISSU on the Cisco Nexus
9000 Series switches causes the supervisor CPU to reset and to load the new software version. After the CPU loads the updated
version of the Cisco NX-OS software, the system restores the control plane to the previous known configuration and the runtime
state and it gets in-sync with the data plane, thereby completing the ISSU process.

The data plane traffic is not disrupted during the ISSU process. In other words, the data plane forwards the packets while
the control plane is being upgraded, any servers that are connected to the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches do not see any
traffic disruption. The control plane downtime during the ISSU process is approximately less than 120 seconds.

### Performing Enhanced ISSU on Top-of-Rack (ToR) Switches with a Single Supervisor

| **Note** | ---   Enhanced ISSU may not be supported if there are any underlying kernel differences. The system will prompt the following message: ``` Host kernel is not compatible with target image. Full ISSU will be performed and control plane will be impacted. ``` In effect, system will perform non-disruptive ISSU instead of enhanced ISSU.   --- |
| --- | --- |

The Cisco NX-OS software normally runs directly on the hardware. However, configuring enhanced or container-based ISSU on
single supervisor ToRs is accomplished by creating virtual instances of the supervisor modules and the line cards. With enhanced
ISSU, the software runs inside a separate Linux container (LXC) for the supervisors and the line cards. A third container
is created as part of the ISSU procedure, and it is brought up as a standby supervisor.

The virtual instances (or the Linux containers) communicate with each other using an emulated Ethernet connection. In the
normal state, only two Linux containers are instantiated: vSup1 (a virtual SUP container in an active role) and vLC (a virtual
linecard container). Enhanced ISSU requires 16G memory on the switch.

To enable booting in the enhanced ISSU (LXC) mode, use the [no] boot mode lxc  command. This command is executed in the config mode. See the following sample configuration for more information:

```

switch(config)# boot mode lxc
Using LXC boot mode
Please save the configuration and reload system to switch into the LXC mode.
switch(config)# copy r s
[########################################] 100%
Copy complete.

```

| **Note** | ---   When you are enabling enhanced ISSU for the first time, you have to reload the switch first.   --- |
| --- | --- |

During the software upgrade with enhanced ISSU, the supervisor control plane stays up with minimal switchover downtime disruption
and the forwarding state of the network is maintained accurately during the upgrade. The supervisor is upgraded first and
the line card is upgraded next.

The data plane traffic is not disrupted during the ISSU process. The control plane downtime is less than 6 seconds.

| **Note** | ---   In-service software downgrades (ISSDs), also known as non-disruptive downgrades, are not supported.   --- |
| --- | --- |

For information on ISSU and high availability, see the [Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS High Availability and Redundancy Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/switches/nexus-9000-series-switches/products-installation-and-configuration-guides-list.html).

## Recommendations for Upgrading the Cisco NX-OS Software

Cisco recommends performing a Nexus Health and Configuration Check before performing an upgrade. The benefits include identification
of potential issues, susceptible Field Notices and Security Vulnerabilities, missing recommended configurations and so on.
For more information about the procedure, see [Perform Nexus Health and Configuration Check](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ios-nx-os-software/nx-os-software/217990-configure-an-automated-nexus-health-chec.html).

## Prerequisites for Upgrading the Cisco NX-OS Software

Upgrading the Cisco
NX-OS software has the following prerequisites:

* For ISSU compatibility for all releases, see the [Cisco Nexus 9000 and 3000 Upgrade and ISSU Matrix](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/Website/datacenter/ISSUmatrix/index.html).
* Ensure that
  everyone who has access to the device or the network is not configuring the
  device or the network during this time. You cannot configure a device during an
  upgrade. Use the
  show
  configuration session summary command to verify that you have no active configuration
  sessions.
* Save, commit, or
  discard any active configuration sessions before upgrading or downgrading the
  Cisco NX-OS software image on your device. On a device with dual supervisors,
  the active supervisor module cannot switch over to the standby supervisor
  module during the Cisco NX-OS software upgrade if you have an active
  configuration session.
* To transfer NX-OS software images to the Nexus switch through a file transfer protocol (such as TFTP, FTP, SFTP, SCP, etc.),
  verify that the Nexus switch can connect to the remote file server where the NX-OS software images are stored. If you do not
  have a router to route traffic between subnets, ensure that the Nexus switch and the remote file server are on the same subnetwork.
  To verify connectivity to the remote server, transfer a test file using a file transfer protocol of your choice or use the
  ping command if the remote file server is configured to respond to ICMP Echo Request packets. An example of using the ping
  command to verify connectivity to a remote file server 192.0.2.100 is shown below:

  ```
  switch# ping 192.0.2.100 vrf management
  PING 192.0.2.100 (192.0.2.100): 56 data bytes
  64 bytes from 192.0.2.100: icmp_seq=0 ttl=239 time=106.647 ms
  64 bytes from 192.0.2.100: icmp_seq=1 ttl=239 time=76.807 ms
  64 bytes from 192.0.2.100: icmp_seq=2 ttl=239 time=76.593 ms
  64 bytes from 192.0.2.100: icmp_seq=3 ttl=239 time=81.679 ms
  64 bytes from 192.0.2.100: icmp_seq=4 ttl=239 time=76.5 ms

  --- 192.0.2.100 ping statistics ---
  5 packets transmitted, 5 packets received, 0.00% packet loss
  round-trip min/avg/max = 76.5/83.645/106.647 ms

  ```
* For non-disruptive ISSU in spanning tree topology, before running the show spanning-tree issu-impact  command, verify the following criteria:

  + No Topology change must be active in any STP instance
  + Bridge assurance(BA) should not be active on any port (except MCT and vPC peer link)
  + There should not be any Non-Edge Designated Forwarding port (except MCT and vPC peer link)
  + ISSU criteria must be met on the vPC peer switch

For more information on configuration sessions, see the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS System Management Configuration Guide specific to your release.

## Prerequisites for Downgrading the Cisco NX-OS Software

Downgrading the Cisco
NX-OS software has the following prerequisites:

* Before you
  downgrade from a Cisco NX-OS release that supports the Control Plane Policing
  (CoPP) feature to an earlier Cisco NX-OS release that does not support the CoPP
  feature, you should verify compatibility using the
  show incompatibility nxos
  bootflash:filename  command. If an incompatibility exists, disable any
  features that are incompatible with the downgrade image before downgrading the
  software.

## Cisco NX-OS Software Upgrade Guidelines

Before attempting to upgrade to any software image, follow these guidelines:

* For a device that is running on Cisco Nexus Release 10.1(2), 10.2(1)F,
  and 10.2(2)F, ND-ISSU is not supported if L2 sub-interfaces are configured.
* Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.2(2)F, Cisco Nexus 9504 and 9508 platform switches, and Cisco Nexus 9508-R, R2, and
  RX line cards support Cisco NX-OS 64-bit images. Disruptive upgrade from earlier releases to 10.2(2)F 64-bit NX-OS image is
  supported. Cisco NX-OS 32-bit image is not supported on these platform switches anymore.
* Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.2(2)F, FCoE/FC NPV is supported on N9K-C9336C-FX2-E platform switches.

  ISSU with with FCoE (Fiber Channel over Ethernet)/FC (Fiber Channel) NPV (N-port Virtualization) is supported on some Cisco
  Nexus 9000 switches. An ISSU allows you to upgrade the device software while the switch continues to forward traffic. You
  can perform an in-service software upgrade (ISSU), also known as a nondisruptive upgrade, for some Cisco Nexus 9000 switches.
  The default upgrade process is disruptive. Using the nondisruptive option helps ensure a nondisruptive upgrade.

  Fibre Channel N-port Virtualization (NPV) can co-exist with VXLAN on different fabric uplinks but on same or different front
  panel ports on the Cisco Nexus 93180YC-FX, N9K-C9336C-FX2-E, and N9k-C93360YC-FX2 switches.
* Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.2(2)F, ND ISSU is supported for FEX and you need to re-adjust the BGP graceful-restart restart time  command for the upgrade to work non-disruptively. This must be done for each FEX upgrade one-by-one.

  The following example shows the time taken to re-adjust bgp-graceful restart-time for each non-disruptive FEX upgrade.

  ```
  In the Non-disruptive upgrade with FEX, each FEX will upgrade taking about 90 secondss
  (1.5 minutess) sequentially (one-by-one and not a parallel upgrade).
    Total non-disruptive upgrade time for all FEX = No. of fex * time taken per fex
                                       For 10 FEX = 10 * 90
                                                  = 900 seconds or 15 minutes
  ```
* MPLS strip, GRE strip, and any underlying ACL configuration is not ISSU compatible when you perform ND ISSU to Cisco NX-OS
  Release 10.2(2)F from a previous release.

  After ND ISSU to Cisco NX-OS Release 10.2(2)F or 10.2(3)F from a previous release, post GRE strip dot1q tunnel VLAN\_tag might be missing. Workaround for this issue is to remove and
  add port ACL from L2 interfaces for GRE strip enabled interface.
* For ISSU compatibility for all releases, see the [Cisco Nexus 9000 and 3000 Upgrade and ISSU Matrix](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/Website/datacenter/ISSUmatrix/index.html).
* Beginning from Cisco NX-OS Release 10.2(1), Cisco Nexus 9300 and 9500 platform switches support 64-bit image.
* Non-disruptive upgrade to 64-bit image is supported from Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(9) onwards. See supported platforms in [Cisco Nexus 9000 and 3000 Upgrade and ISSU Matrix](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/dcn/tools/nexus-9k3k-issu-matrix/index.html).
* Beginning from Cisco NX-OS Release 10.2(8)M onwards, Cisco Nexus 9300-FX3 supports non-disruptive upgrade.
* Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.1(1), during the disruptive upgrade to the 64-bit image or a downgrade from 64-bit
  to 32-bit image, if feature ITD is enabled, refer to *Guidelines and Limitations for ITD* in the *Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Intelligent Traffic Director Configuration Guide, Release 10.1(x)*, if the upgrade or downgrade proceeds with an ASIC reload.
* When you use install all  with no-reload  option, the saved configuration cannot be used before you reload the device. Saving configuration in this state can result
  in incorrect startup configuration once you reload the device with new version of NX-OS.
* For switches that are in LXC boot mode, the enhanced LXC upgrade will fall back to standard ND ISSU as the target image kernels are likely be different than the current
  image.
* Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.2(3)F, for switches that are in LXC mode and for non-destruptive upgrade, a new option
  skip-kernel-upgrade  is added to install  command.
* The following are the two methods by which the ND ISSU can be performed in LXC mode:

  + ND ISSU in LXC mode - Switchover-based ISSU that is similar to EOR. Second SUP is brought up in new container and switchover
    is done. The second SUP now becomes the new active. There is no change to the kernel.
  + Fallback ND LXC ISSU - This is only done when the above switchover-based ISSU cannot be done (SRG Kernel incompatible or less
    memory). The kernel is upgraded.
  + skip-kernel-upgrade option will force ND ISSU in LXC mode - Switchover-based ISSU (even in case when running) and target kernels
    are incompatible.
* When upgrading from Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(3) to Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(6) or later, if you do not retain configurations
  of the TRM enabled VRFs from Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(3), or if you create new VRFs after the upgrade, the auto-generation
  of ip multicast multipath s-g-hash next-hop-based  CLI, when feature ngmvpn  is enabled, will not happen. You must enable the CLI manually for each TRM enabled VRF. For the configuration instructions,
  see the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS VXLAN Configuration Guide, Release 10.1(x).
* When you upgrade a Cisco Nexus 9000 device to Cisco NX-OS Release 10.1(x), if a QSFP port is configured with the manual breakout
  command and is using a QSA, the configuration of the interface Ethernet 1/50/1 is no longer supported and must be removed.
  To restore the configuration, you must manually configure the interface Ethernet 1/50 on the device.
* When redistributing static routes, Cisco NX-OS requires the **default-information originate** command to successfully redistribute the default static route starting in 7.0(3)I7(6).
* To perform an EPLD upgrade after an ISSU upgrade from Cisco NX-OS Release 7.x to Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(x), before starting
  the EPLD upgrade, add the copy run start command.
* When upgrading from Cisco NX-OS Release 9.2(4) or earlier releases to Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(4) or later, running configuration
  contains extra TCAM configuration lines. You can ignore these extra lines as they do not have an effect on the upgrade and
  configuration.
* When performing an ISSU from Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(1) or 9.3(2) to Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(3) or later, ensure that the
  features with user-defined ports, such as <ssh port>, are within the prescribed port range. If the port range is incorrect, follow the syslog message recommendation. For more
  information about the port range, see Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS IP SLAs Configuration Guide, Release 10.1(x).
* When upgrading from Cisco NX-OS Release 9.2(2) or earlier releases to Cisco NX-OS Release 10.1(x), you need to make sure that
  ingress RACL TCAM region is not more than 50% full. Otherwise, the atomic update feature will be enabled after the upgrade
  and interfaces with RACLs that exceed 50% of TCAM allocation will remain down.
* Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.1(1), ISSU is supported on FC/FCoE switch mode on Cisco Nexus 93360YC-FX2. For more
  information about the FC/FCoE switch mode and supported hardware, see Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS SAN Switching Configuration Guide, Release 10.1(x).
* Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.1(1), Enhanced ISSU is supported on FC/FCoE switch mode for Cisco Nexus 93180YC-FX and
  93360YC-FX2 switches. For more information about the FC/FCoE switch mode and supported hardware, see Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS SAN Switching Configuration Guide, Release 10.1(x).
* Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.1(1), Enhanced ISSU is supported on FC/FCoE NPV mode for Cisco Nexus 93180YC-FX and
  93360YC-FX2 switches. For more information about the FC/FCoE NPV mode and supported hardware, see Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS FC-NPV and FCoE NPV Configuration Guide, Release 10.1(x).
* The compressed image of Cisco Nexus 3000-series is hardware dependent and can only be used on the same device that it got
  compressed or downloaded from CCO. Do not use the Nexus 3000-series compressed image on Nexus 9000-series
* The following limitation applies to software upgrades from 7.0(3)I5 to 10.1(x) or 9.2(3) to 10.1(x):

  If you have the same NetFlow configuration in both VLAN and SVI, you must remove the NetFlow flow monitor from the VLAN configuration
  prior to the upgrade. Once upgraded, reconfigure NetFlow by creating a new flow monitor and adding it to the VLAN configuration.
  Failure to perform these steps results in error messages and the inability to modify the VLAN NetFlow configuration in the
  upgraded software.
* When upgrading from Cisco NX-OS Releases 7.0(3)I4(8), 7.0(3)I5(3), and 7.0(3)I6(1) to Cisco NX-OS Release 10.1(x) results
  in a disruptive upgrade. If syncing images to standby SUP failed during the disruptive upgrade from Cisco NX-OS Releases 7.0(3)I4(8),
  7.0(3)I5(3,) or 7.0(3)I6(1) to 10.1(x), you should manually copy the image to the standby SUP and perform the disruptive upgrade.
* When upgrading directly to Cisco NX-OS Release 10.1(x) from any release prior to 7.0(x), the upgrade will be disruptive. For
  a non-disruptive upgrade, an intermediate upgrade to Cisco NX-OS Release 9.x is required. We recommend upgrading to the latest
  release of Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(x) as an intermediate hop for the upgrade. For information about the supported upgrade
  paths, see the [Cisco Nexus 9000 and 3000 Upgrade and ISSU Matrix](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/Website/datacenter/ISSUmatrix/index.html).
* When upgrading from Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)I6(1) or 7.0(3)I7(1) to Cisco NX-OS Release 10.1(x), if the Cisco Nexus 9000
  Series switches are running vPC and they are connected to an IOS-based switch via Layer 2 vPC, there is a likelihood that
  the Layer 2 port channel on the IOS side will become error disabled. The workaround is to disable the spanning-tree etherchannel
  guard misconfig command on the IOS switch before starting the upgrade process.

  Once both the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches are upgraded, you can re-enable the command.
* If you are upgrading from Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)I5(2) to Cisco NX-OS Release 10.1(x) by using the  install all  command, BIOS will not be upgraded due to CSCve24965. When the upgrade to Cisco NX-OS Release 10.1(x) is complete, use the
   install all  command again to complete the BIOS upgrade, if applicable.
* An upgrade that is performed via the install all  command for Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)I2(2b) to Release 10.1(x) might result in the VLANs being unable to be added to the
  existing FEX HIF trunk ports. To recover from this, the following steps should be performed after all FEXs have come online
  and the HIFs are operationally up:

  1. Enter the copy run bootflash:fex\_config\_restore.cfg command at the prompt.
  2. Enter the copy bootflash:fex\_config\_restore.cfg running-config echo-commands command at the prompt.
* In Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)I6(1) and earlier, performing an ASCII replay or running the copy file run command on a FEX HIF
  configuration requires manually reapplying the FEX configuration after the FEX comes back up.
* When upgrading to Cisco NX-OS Release 10.1(x) from 7.0(3)I2(x) or before and running EVPN VXLAN configuration, an intermediate
  upgrade to 7.0(3)I4(x) or 7.0(3)I5(x) or 7.0(3)I6(x) is required.
* Before enabling the FHS on the interface, we recommend that you carve the ifacl TCAM region on Cisco Nexus 9300 and 9500 platform
  switches. If you carved the ifacl TCAM region in a previous release, you must reload the system after upgrading to Cisco NX-OS
  Release 10.1(x). Uploading the system creates the required match qualifiers for the FHS TCAM region, ifacl.
* Before enabling the FHS, we recommend that you carve the ing-redirect TCAM region on Cisco Nexus 9200 and 9300-EX platform
  switches. If you carved the ing-redirect TCAM region in a previous release, you must reload the system after upgrading to
  Cisco NX-OS Release 10.1(x). Uploading the system creates the required match qualifiers for the FHS TCAM region, ing-redirect.
* Upgrading from Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(1), 9.3(2) or 9.3(3) to a higher release, with Embedded Event Manager (EEM) configurations
  that are saved to the running configuration, may cause a DME error to be presented. The error is in the output of the show consistency-checker dme running-config enhanced  command, specifically, the event manager commands. If this error occurs, delete all EEM applet configurations after completing
  the ISSU, then reapply the EEM configurations.
* For any prior release version upgrading to Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(5) using ISSU, if the following logging level commands
  are configured, they are missing in the upgraded version and must be reconfigured:

  + logging level evmc
    value
  + logging level mvsh
    value
  + logging level fs-daemon
    value
* For any prior release version upgrading to Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(6) using ISSU, if the following logging level commands
  are configured, they are missing in the upgraded version and must be reconfigured:

  + logging level evmc
    value
  + logging level mvsh
    value
* An error occurs when you try to perform an ISSU if you changed the reserved VLAN without entering the copy running-config
  save-config and reload commands.
* The install all command is the recommended method for software upgrades because it performs configuration compatibility checks
  and BIOS upgrades automatically. In contrast, changing the boot variables and reloading the device bypasses these checks and
  the BIOS upgrade and therefore it is not recommended.
* Upgrading from Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)I1(2), Release 7.0(3)I1(3), or Release 7.0(3)I1(3a) requires installing a patch for
  Cisco Nexus 9500 platform switches only. For more information on the upgrade patch, see Patch Upgrade Instructions.
* An ISSU can be performed only from a Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)I4(1) to a later image.
* While performing an ISSU, VRRP and VRRPv3 displays the following messages:

  + If VRRPv3 is enabled:

    ```
    2015 Dec 29 20:41:44 MDP-N9K-6 %$ VDC-1 %$ %USER-0-SYSTEM_MSG: ISSU ERROR: Service

    ```
* Guest Shell is disabled during an ISSU and reactivated after the upgrade. Any application running in the Guest Shell is affected.
* If you have ITD probes configured, you must disable the ITD service (using the shutdown  command) before upgrading to Cisco NX-OS Release 10.1(x). After the upgrade, enter the feature sla sender  command to enable IP SLA for ITD probes and then the no shutdown  command to re-enable the ITD service. (If you upgrade without shutting down the service, you can enter the feature sla sender  command after the upgrade.)
* Schedule the upgrade when your network is stable and steady.
* Avoid any power interruption, which could corrupt the software image, during the installation procedure.
* On devices with dual supervisor modules, both supervisor modules must have connections on the console ports to maintain connectivity
  when switchovers occur during a software upgrade. See the [Hardware Installation Guide](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/switches/nexus-9000-series-switches/products-installation-guides-list.html) for your specific chassis.
* Perform the installation on the active supervisor module, not the standby supervisor module.
* The
  install all
   command is the recommended method for software upgrades because it performs configuration compatibility checks and BIOS upgrades
  automatically. In contrast, changing the boot variables and reloading the device bypasses these checks and the BIOS upgrade
  and therefore is not recommended.

  | **Note** | ---   For Cisco Nexus 9500 platform switches with -R line cards, you must save the configuration and reload the device to upgrade from Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)F3(5) to 9.3(1). To upgrade from Cisco NX-OS Release 9.2(2) or 9.2(3), we recommend that you use the  install all  command.   --- |
  | --- | --- |
* You can detect an incomplete or corrupt NX-OS software image prior to performing an upgrade by verifying the MD5, SHA256 or
  SHA512 checksum of the software image. To verify the MD5 checksum of the software image, run the show file bootflash:<IMAGE-NAME>md5sum  command and compare the resulting value to the published MD5 checksum for the software image on [Cisco’s Software Download](https://software.cisco.com/download/home) website. To verify the SHA512 checksum of the software image, run the show file bootflash:<IMAGE-NAME>sha512sum  command and compare the resulting value to the published SHA512 checksum for the software image on [Cisco’s Software Download](https://software.cisco.com/download/home) website.
* When upgrading from Cisco Nexus 94xx, 95xx, and 96xx line cards to Cisco Nexus 9732C-EX line cards and their fabric modules,
  upgrade the Cisco NX-OS software before inserting the line cards and fabric modules. Failure to do so can cause a diagnostic
  failure on the line card and no TCAM space to be allocated. You must use the write\_erase  command followed by the reload  command.
* If you upgrade from a Cisco NX-OS release that supports the CoPP feature to a Cisco NX-OS release that supports the CoPP feature
  with additional classes for new protocols, you must either run the setup utility using the setup
  command or use the copp profile
  command for the new CoPP classes to be available. For more information on these commands, see the "Configuring Control Plane
  Policing" chapter in the *Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Security Configuration Guide, Release 10.1(x)* .
* For secure POAP, ensure that DHCP snooping is enabled and set firewall rules to block unintended or malicious DHCP servers.
  For more information on POAP, see the *Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fundamentals Configuration Guide, Release 10.1(x)*.
* When you upgrade from an earlier release to a Cisco NX-OS release that supports switch profiles, you have the option to move
  some of the running-configuration commands to a switch profile. For more information, see the *Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS System Management Configuration Guide, Release 10.1(x)*.
* By default, the software upgrade process is disruptive.
* OpenFlow and LACP fast timer rate configurations are not supported for ISSU.
* Guest Shell is disabled during an ISSU and reactivated after the upgrade.
* When performing ND ISSU using BGP non-default hold timers, ensure that the BGP graceful-restart timer is reasonably long enough,
  for example, 180 seconds.
* During an ISSU on a Cisco Nexus 9300 Series switch, all First-Hop Redundancy Protocols (FHRPs) will cause the other peer to
  become active if the node undergoing the ISSU is active.
* Make sure that both vPC peers are in the same mode (regular mode or enhanced mode) before performing a nondisruptive upgrade.

  | **Note** | ---   vPC peering between an enhanced ISSU mode (boot mode lxc) configured switch and a non-enhanced ISSU mode switch is not supported.   --- |
  | --- | --- |
* During an ISSU, the software reload process on the first vPC device locks its vPC peer device by using CFS messaging over
  the vPC communications channel. Only one device at a time is upgraded. When the first device completes its upgrade, it unlocks
  its peer device. The second device then performs the upgrade process, locking the first device as it does so. During the upgrade,
  the two vPC devices temporarily run different releases of Cisco NX-OS; however, the system functions correctly because of
  its backward compatibility support.
* ISSU is not supported when onePK is enabled. You can run the show feature | include onep command to verify that this feature is disabled before performing an ISSU or enhanced ISSU.
* In general, ISSUs are supported for the following:

  + From a major release to any associated maintenance release.
  + From the last two maintenance releases to the next two major releases.
  + From an earlier maintenance release to the next two major releases.

  | **Note** | ---   For a list of specific releases from which you can perform a disruptive upgrade or a nondisruptive ISSU, see the [Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/switches/nexus-9000-series-switches/products-release-notes-list.html) for your particular release.   --- |
  | --- | --- |
* Occasionally, while the switch is operationally Up and running, the Device not found logs are displayed on the console. This issue is observed because the switch attempts to find an older ASIC version and the
  error messages for the PCI probe failure are enabled in the code. There is no functionality impact or traffic loss due to
  this issue.
* ISSU is not supported if EPLD is not at Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)I3(1) or later.
* ISSU supports EPLD image upgrades using **install all nxos <nxos-image> epld <epld-image>** command, during disruptive system (NX-OS) upgrade.
* A simplified NX-OS numbering format is used for platforms that are supported in Cisco NX-OS 10.1(x) releases. In order to
  support a software upgrade from releases prior to Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)I7(4) that have the old release format, an installer
  feature supplies an I9(x) label as a suffix to the actual release during the
  install all
   operation. This label is printed as part of the image during the install operation from any release prior to Cisco NX-OS
  Release 7.0(3)I7(4) to 10.1(x), and it can be ignored. See the following example.

  ```

* Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(5), standard, nondisruptive ISSU, **on switches that are configured with uRPF**, is supported on the following:

  + Cisco Nexus 9300-EX platform switches
  + Cisco Nexus 9300-FX/FX2 platform switches
  + Cisco Nexus 9300-GX platform switches

  | **Note** | ---   Prior to Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(5), if any of the above switches were configured with uRPF, standard, nondisruptive ISSU was not supported.   --- |
  | --- | --- |
* ISSU is blocked if
  boot poap enable
   is configured.

  + Make sure that you follow below procedure to upgrade to 10.2(x) release:

    - Upgrade from 7.0(3)I7(1), 7.0(3)I7(2) or 7.0(3)I7(3) to 7.0(3)I7(5) and above code or 9.x code
    - Upgrade from 7.0(3)I7(5) or 9.x code to 10.2(x) code
* On performing a non-disruptive ISSU from Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)I6(1) to any higher version, a traffic loss might occur
  based on the number of VLANs configured. To avoid traffic loss, it is recommended to increase the routing protocol's graceful
  restart timer to higher value. The recommended value of the graceful restart timer is 600 seconds. You can further increase
  or decrease this value based on the scale of the configuration.
* Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.1(1), Fs\_daemon does not support snmpwalk on devices with more than 5000 files. When performing snmpwalk on a device with more than 5000 files, the error **resourceUnavailable (This is likely a out-of-memory failure within the agent)** is an expected behaviour.
* Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.1(2), CoPP is supported on N9K-X9624D-R2 and N9K-C9508-FM-R2 platform switches.
* Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.1(2), RACL is supported on N9K-X9624D-R2 and N9K-C9508-FM-R2 platform switches.
* While performing an ISSU from Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(5), 9.3(6), 9.3(7), 10.1(1), or 10.1(2) to Cisco NX-OS Release 10.2(1)
  or higher release, ISSU will be blocked.
* ISSU is blocked when the delay config is present in track list Boolean/weight.
* If the IPv6 ND timeouts during ISSU, then the IPv6 BFD session may flap after the ISSU.
* Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.2(3)F, non-disruptive ISSU is supported for VPC fabric peering on all Cisco Nexus 9300-X
  TORs. Both standard and enhanced non-disruptive upgrades are supported. Note that ISSU should be started or triggered when
  there is no failure. An example for failure would be one of the VPC legs is down.
* The recommended routing protocol graceful restart timer is 600 seconds and nve source-interface hold-down-time is 400 seconds.
* It is recommended to set disable-fka  on VFC interfaces in E or F mode, when invoking ND native ISSU on switch mode testbed. If not, it can be disruptive.
* If there is a VRF scale, for a non-disruptive ISSU under each VRF, you must configure graceful restart timer to 300 seconds.
* For platforms that need to be upgraded from any release to nxos64-cs.10.3(1)F or higher release, use nxos.9.3.10.bin or nxos64-cs.10.2(3)F
  or higher release as an interim hop. This restriction is applicable to both disruptive and non-disruptive upgrades. The nxos64-msll.10.3(1)F
  does not have this restriction.
* Loading an unsupported image on Cisco Nexus 9800 platform switches cause the switch to be stuck. Only a power cycle can reset
  it.
* Disruptive upgrade from any version before 9.3(10) or 10.2(3)F may fail due to [CSCwb63451](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb63451). You must upgrade to 9.3(10) or 10.2(3)F first, before upgrading to 10.3(1)F or later.
* Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.3(2)F, 2xSFP Eth10/1-2 are not supported on N9K-C9400-SW-GX2A. However, from Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(2)F onwards, N9K-C9400-SW-GX2A Sup card ports 2xSFP Eth10/1-2 are supported.
* While performing an ISSU on the L2 switch in a vPC complex or a LAN scenario, the IGMP group timeout must be configured with
  higher value as the L2 switch will not be able to forward the reports/queries during the control plane down time. The L2 snooping
  querier interval must also be matched to the L3 querier interval.
* When upgrading from earlier release to Cisco NX-OS Release 10.3(3)F and later, if the hardware rate-limiter span-egress  command is configured then it must be removed and reapplied after the upgrade/ISSU is complete.
* ASIC SFP+ ports Eth10/1-2 are not supported in Cisco NX-OS Releases 10.3(2)F, 10.3(3)F, and 10.4(1)F. Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(2)F, these ports are supported. However, note that after reloading the system, these
  ASIC SFP+ Eth10/1-2 ports can take up to 3 minutes to link up.
* Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.3(3)F, only the LXC mode is supported on Cisco Nexus 9300-FX3 and 9300-GX switches,
  which allows you to perform enhanced non-disruptive ISSU with minimal downtime.
* While performing multi-hop ND ISSU upgrade to higher releases, use 10.3(5)M or higher release as an intermediate hop.

  + If the switch has been previously upgraded using multi-hop ND ISSU and experiences unexpected CoPP drops, open a TAC case
    to determine if remediation is required.
* Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(1)F, only the LXC mode is supported on Cisco Nexus 9300-FX and 9300-FX2 switches,
  in addition to Cisco Nexus 9300-FX3 and 9300-GX switches. This allows you to perform enhanced non-disruptive ISSU with minimal
  downtime. However, on the rest of the Cisco Nexus 9000 switches, you have an option to perform a non-disruptive ISSU in the
  enhanced LXC mode with minimal downtime.
* Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(1)F, only the enhanced LXC mode is supported on Cisco Nexus N9K-C9332D-H2R, N9K-C9348GC-FX3,
  and N9K-C9348GC-FX3PH switches by default.
* Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(2)F, SR ISSU is not supported with underlay ISIS.
* Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(2)F, nondisruptive ISSU is supported for segment routing traffic engineering (SR-TE)
  features with BGP as underlay on Cisco Nexus 9300 and 92348GC-X platform switches; and on 9300-HX platform switches from Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(3)F. However, the following features are not supported on nondisruptive ISSU:

  + SR L2EVPN
  + ISIS and OSPF underlay
  + vPC configuration with segment-routing
  + Egress Peer engineering
  + Segment routing and GRE co existence
* Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(2)F, for Nexus 9300-R platforms, to upgrade bios to the latest version you should
  first upgrade to nxos image. This release onwards, the install all nxos command only upgrades the nxos sw to the latest version
  but the bios image will be upgraded to the last bios released prior to 10.4(2)F version.

  To upgrade to bios released with 10.4(2)F or higher version, first upgrade the nxos image and then use bios-force option to
  upgrade the bios. For example,

  1. Install all nxos bootflash:nxos64-msll.10.4.2.F.bin.

     The system reloads and boots up with 10.4(2)F image.
  2. Install all nxos bios-force.

     | **Note** | ---   The switch reloads twice, once for nxos upgrade and then again for bios upgrade.   --- |
     | --- | --- |
* Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(3)F, non-disruptive ISSU is not supported on Cisco Nexus 92348GC-X.
* While performing ND ISSU, if a router is configured with BGP prefix peers, prefix-peer-timeout (default value - 30s) should
  be greater than GR timer (default value - 120s), to allow the prefix peers to resume the connection after ISSU.
* ND-ISSU and Disruptive ISSU is supported on N9K-C92348GC-FX3 starting Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(4)M image to image from later
  releases only.

## ISSU Platform Support

The following tables identify the platforms supporting standard and enhanced ISSU, and the release when the support was introduced.

| **Note** | ---   Enhanced ISSU cannot be supported if there is kernel update in the target release without reloading the container.  The system will prompt the following message: ``` Host kernel is not compatible with target image. Full ISSU will be performed and control plane will be impacted. ``` In effect, system will perform non-disruptive ISSU instead of enhanced ISSU.  --- |

## Cisco NX-OS Software Downgrade Guidelines

Before attempting to downgrade to an earlier software release, follow these guidelines:

* The only supported method of downgrading a Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch is to utilize the install all command. Changing
  the boot variables, saving the configuration, and reloading the switch is not a supported method to downgrade the switch.

  Disable the Guest Shell if you need to downgrade from Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(x) to an earlier release.

  + Performing an ISSU downgrade from Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(x) to Release 7.0(3)I4(1) with an FCoE (Fiber Channel over Ethernet)
    NPV (N-port Virtualization) configuration causes the port channel to crash with a core file:

    ```
    [################ ] 38%2016 Apr 18 20:52:35 n93-ns1 %$ VDC-1 %$ %SYSMGR-2-
    SERVICE_CRASHED: Service "port-channel" (PID 14976) hasn't caught signal 11 (core will
    be saved)
    ```
  + ISSU (non-disruptive) downgrade is not supported
* When downgrading from the Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(x) to earlier releases, any ACL with the statistics per-entry command enabled
  and applied as RACL needs the statistics per-entry command removed from the running configuration before downgrading. Otherwise,
  the interfaces on which this ACL is applied as a RACL will be error disabled after the downgrade.
* Prior to downgrading a Cisco Nexus 9500-series switch, with -FX or -FX+EX line cards, from Cisco NX-OS Release 10.1(x) to
  earlier releases (9.2(x) or 7.x), the TCAM region that applies to NetFlow (ing-netflow) should be carved to zero (0) using
  the following command:

  hardware access-list tcam region ing-netflow 0

  The configuration change is required because the default ing-netflow TCAM region in 9.3(1) and onwards is 512 while the default
  in 9.2(x) and earlier is 0.
* When downgrading from the Cisco NX-OS Release 10.1(x) to a release prior to 9.3(x), make sure that the ACL TCAM usage for
  ingress features does exceed the allocated TCAM space in the absence of the label sharing feature. Label sharing is a new
  feature in Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(x). Otherwise, interfaces with RACLs that could not fit in the TCAM will be disabled after
  the downgrade.
* Software downgrades should be performed using the
  install all
   command. Changing the boot variables, saving the configuration, and reloading the switch is not a supported method to downgrade
  the switch.
* The following limitation applies to Cisco Nexus platform switches that support Trust Anchor Module (TAM):

  The TACACS global key cannot be restored when downgrading from Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(3) and higher to any earlier version.
  TAM was updated to version-7 in 9.3(3), but earlier NX-OS versions used TAM version-3.
* iCAM must be disabled before downgrading from Release 9.2(x) or Release 9.3(x) → 7.0(3)I7(1). Only Release 9.3(1) → Release
  9.2(4) can be performed if iCAM is enabled.
* Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(3), new configuration commands exist for SRAPP (with sub-mode options for MPLS and
  SRTE). The SRAPP configuration on the switch running release 9.3(3) (or later) will not be present if the switch is downgraded
  to an earlier release.
* On devices with dual supervisor modules, both supervisor modules must have connections on the console ports to maintain connectivity
  when switchovers occur during a software downgrade. See the [Hardware Installation Guide](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/switches/nexus-9000-series-switches/products-installation-guides-list.html) for your specific chassis.
* Cisco NX-OS automatically installs and enables the guest shell by default. However, if the device is reloaded with a Cisco
  NX-OS image that does not provide guest shell support, the existing guest shell is automatically removed and a %VMAN-2-INVALID\_PACKAGE
  message is issued. As a best practice, remove the guest shell with the guestshell destroy
  command before downgrading to an earlier Cisco NX-OS image.
* You must delete the switch profile (if configured) when downgrading from a Cisco NX-OS release that supports switch profiles
  to a release that does not. For more information, see the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS System Management Configuration Guide, Release 10.1(x).
* Software downgrades are disruptive. In-service software downgrades (ISSDs), also known as nondisruptive downgrades, are not
  supported.
* When downgrading from Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(3) or later to 7.0(3)I7(7), disable BFD for the BGP neighbor prefix peer using
  the no bfd  command.
* While downgrading from the Cisco NX-OS Release 10.2(1)F or higher to an earlier release, the **install all** command is blocked when the delay config is present in track list Boolean/weight.
* While performing ISSD from Cisco NX-OS Release 10.2(3)F to Cisco NX-OS Release 10.2(2)F with **epbr L2** applied on interfaces, remove the policies from interfaces before performing ISSD to avoid the duplicate tracks issue.
* Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.2(3)F, if you have configured the lldp chassis-id switch  command, then you must disable the command before performing ISSD.
* Beginning with 10.2(3)F, although application of ePBR policy to access ports is supported, downgrading with this configuration
  is not recommended.
* When feature ngmvpn is enabled and a disruptive downgrade is performed from Cisco NX-OS Release 10.3(2)F to Cisco NX-OS Release
  10.3(1)F, although a few VRFs are missing from the show run output, this is only a display issue, and has no functional impact.
* When a switch is downgraded from Cisco NX-OS Release 10.3(3)F or 10.4(1)F to a version that supports both Native and LXC modes, the switch always goes to Native mode even if the upgrade was done from
  LXC mode. To keep the mode persistent after a downgrade, ensure that you perform the downgrade in the following sequence:

  | **Note** | ---  + The following sections are applicable only to Cisco Nexus 9300-FX3 and 9300-GX platform switches. + When system comes up in native mode on downgrade, boot mode lxc is removed from configuration.  --- |
  | --- | --- |

  + LXC mode upgrade/downgrade: For example,

    1. The switch is running on Cisco NX-OS Release 10.3(2)F in LXC mode.
    2. Upgrade the version to Cisco NX-OS Release 10.3(3)F (LXC mode).
    3. Downgrade the version to Cisco NX-OS Release 10.3(2)F to the Native mode.
    4. Execute the boot mode lxc configuration command, save the configuration, and reload the switch.
    5. The switch comes up in Cisco NX-OS Release 10.3(2)F LXC mode.
  + Native mode upgrade/downgrade:

    **Example 1**

    1. The switch (9300-FX3 or 9300-GX) is running on Cisco NX-OS Release 10.3(2)F in the Native mode.
    2. Upgrade the version to Cisco NX-OS Release 10.3(3)F (LXC mode), as these (9300-FX3 or 9300-GX) switches support only LXC mode.
    3. Downgrade to any earlier Cisco NX-OS Release [for example, 10.3(2)].
    4. The switch comes up in Cisco NX-OS Release 10.3(2)F in Native mode.

    **Example 2**

    1. The switch (Cisco Nexus 9300-FX or 9300-FX2) is running on Cisco NX-OS Release 10.3(2)F in the Native mode.
    2. Upgrade the version to Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(1)F (LXC mode), as these switches support only LXC mode.
    3. Downgrade to any earlier Cisco NX-OS Release [for example, 10.3(2)].
    4. The switch comes up in Cisco NX-OS Release 10.3(2)F in Native mode.
* When you downgrade from Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(2)F to any earlier releases until 10.3(2)F (included), N9K-C9400-SW-GX2A
  Sup card ports 2xSFP Eth10/1-2 are not supported.
* The N9K-C92348GC-FX3 switch does not support downgrade from Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(4)M to any lower releases as 10.4(4)M
  is the first supported release for this switch.

## Upgrade Paths

For ISSU compatibility for all release and information about the upgrade paths, see the [Cisco Nexus 9000 and 3000 Upgrade and ISSU Matrix](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/Website/datacenter/ISSUmatrix/index.html).

## Upgrade Patch Instructions

On Cisco Nexus 9500 series switches only, a software upgrade from Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), or 7.0(3)I1(3a)
to any other Cisco NX-OS release requires installing two patches prior to upgrading using the install all  command. These patches are available for each respective release and can be downloaded using the links below.

| **Caution** | ---   Failing to follow this procedure could require console access in order to recover the switch after the upgrade.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   These patches are only for upgrading. After the upgrade, the patch is automatically removed. If you decide not to upgrade after installing the patches, do not deactivate it. Deactivating the patch may cause a bios\_daemon crash.   --- |

## Enhanced ISSU

You can enable or disable enhanced (LXC) ISSU. Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(1)F, this section is applicable for N9364C and N9332C platforms only.

| **Note** | ---  * Enhanced ISSU cannot be supported without reloading the container if there are kernel updates in the target release. The system will prompt the following message:   ```   Host kernel is not compatible with target image. Full ISSU will be performed and control plane will be impacted.   ```   In effect, system will perform nondisruptive ISSU instead of enhanced ISSU. * For Cisco N9K-C9332D-GX2B [from Cisco NX-OS Release 10.2(2)F)], and N9K-C9348D-GX2A and N9K-C9364D-GX2A [from Cisco NX-OS   Release 10.2(3)F] platform switches, enhanced (LXC) ISSU is the default mode, so you cannot enable or disable this mode. Also,   for these switches, `virtual supervisor module` is shown in the output of the show module  command. Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.3(3)F, this is applicable to Cisco Nexus 9300-FX3, 9300-GX, and 9300-GX2 platform switches.Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(1)F, this is also applicable to Cisco Nexus 9300-FX and 9300-FX2 platform switches. * It is recommended to set disable-fka  on the FCF, when invoking Fallback ND LXC ISSU on the NPV from Cisco NX-OS Release 10.2(3)F to 10.3(2)F and higher versions. If not, it will be disruptive. Verify the output of the show fcoe-npv issu-impact  command to know whether the disable-fka  must be set.  --- |
| --- | --- |

### Before you begin

Before you enable the LXC mode, ensure that the installed licenses do not include the 27000 string in the license file.

| **Note** | ---   Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.3(3)F, Cisco Nexus 9300-FX3 and 9300-GX switches always boot in LXC mode. This allows you to use Enhanced ISSU with minimal downtime.Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.4(1)F, Cisco Nexus 9300-FX and 9300-FX2 switches always boot in LXC mode.   --- |

### What to do next

Follow the instructions in Upgrading the Cisco NX-OS Software section. Make sure to choose the non-disruptive option if you want to perform an enhanced or regular ISSU.

## Upgrading the Cisco NX-OS Software

Use this procedure to upgrade to a Cisco NX-OS 10.2(x) release.

| **Note** | ---   Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.1(1), the Cisco Nexus -GX series platforms use the 64-bit Cisco NX-OS image file, which has the image filename that begins with "nxos64" (for example, nxos64.10.1.1.bin). The 64-bit software image, which supports software scalability, is available for the Cisco Nexus C9316D-GX, C93600CD-GX, C9364C-GX switches. The non-GX series platforms use the 32-bit Cisco NX-OS image file, which has the image filename that begins with "nxos" (for example, nxos.10.1.1.bin).   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   For Cisco Nexus 9500 platform switches with -R line cards, you must save the configuration and reload the device to upgrade from Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)F3(5) to 10.1(1). To upgrade from Cisco NX-OS Release 9.2(2) or later, we recommend that you use the install all  command.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   If an error message appears during the upgrade, the upgrade will fail because of the reason indicated. See the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Troubleshooting Guide, Release 10.1(x) for a list of possible causes and solutions.  --- |
| --- | --- |

### Before you begin

Before performing a nondisruptive ISSU to Cisco NX-OS Release 10.1(1), you must configure the BGP graceful restart timer to
180 seconds for Cisco Nexus 3132Q-V platform switches.

### SUMMARY STEPS

1. **Read the release notes for the software image file for any exceptions to this upgrade procedure.** See the [Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Release Notes](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/switches/nexus-9000-series-switches/products-release-notes-list.html).
2. Log in to the device on the console port connection.
3. Ensure that the required space is available for the image file to be copied.
4. If you need more space on the active supervisor module, delete unnecessary files to make space available.
5. Verify that there is space available on the standby supervisor module.
6. If you need more space on the standby supervisor module, delete any unnecessary files to make space available.
7. Log in to Cisco.com, choose the software image file for your device from the following URL, and download it to a file server:
   <http://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html>.
8. Copy the software image to the active supervisor module using a transfer protocol. You can use FTP, TFTP, SCP, or SFTP.
9. You can detect an incomplete or corrupt NX-OS software image prior to performing an upgrade by verifying the MD5, SHA256 or
   SHA512 checksum of the software image. To verify the MD5 checksum of the software image, run the show file bootflash:<IMAGE-NAME>md5sum  command and compare the resulting value to the published MD5 checksum for the software image on [Cisco’s Software Download](https://software.cisco.com/download/home) website. To verify the SHA512 checksum of the software image, run the show file bootflash:<IMAGE-NAME>sha512sum  command and compare the resulting value to the published SHA512 checksum for the software image on [Cisco’s Software Download](https://software.cisco.com/download/home) website.
10. You can detect an incomplete or corrupt NX-OS software image prior to performing an upgrade by verifying the MD5, SHA256 or
    SHA512 checksum of the software image. To verify the MD5 checksum of the software image, run the show file bootflash:<IMAGE-NAME>md5sum  command and compare the resulting value to the published MD5 checksum for the software image on [Cisco’s Software Download](https://software.cisco.com/download/home) website. To verify the SHA512 checksum of the software image, run the show file bootflash:<IMAGE-NAME>sha512sum  command and compare the resulting value to the published SHA512 checksum for the software image on [Cisco’s Software Download](https://software.cisco.com/download/home) website.
11. Check the impact of upgrading the software before actually performing the upgrade.
12. Save the running configuration to the startup configuration.
13. If required, upgrade the EPLD image using the install all nxos <nxos-image> epld <epld-image> command.
14. Upgrade the Cisco NX-OS software using the install all nxos bootflash:filename [no-reload | non-disruptive | non-interruptive | serial]  command.
15. (Optional) Display the entire upgrade process.
16. (Optional) Log in and verify that the device is running the required software version.
17. (Optional) If necessary, install any licenses to ensure that the required features are available on the device. See the [Cisco NX-OS Licensing Guide](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/sw/nx-os/licensing/guide/b_Cisco_NX-OS_Licensing_Guide.html).

| **Step 2** | Log in to the device on the console port connection. |
| **Step 3** | Ensure that the required space is available for the image file to be copied.  ``` switch# dir bootflash:       16384    Oct 30 17:05:32 2020  lost+found/ 1964291584    Dec 08 19:44:33 2020  nxos.10.1.1.bin ... Usage for bootflash://sup-local  4825743360 bytes used 16312102912 bytes free 21137846272 bytes total   ```  | **Note** | We recommend that you have the image file for at least one previous release of the Cisco NX-OS software on the device to use if the new image file does not load successfully. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 4** | If you need more space on the active supervisor module, delete unnecessary files to make space available.  ``` switch# delete bootflash:nxos.9.2.1.bin   ``` |
| **Step 5** | Verify that there is space available on the standby supervisor module.  ``` switch# dir bootflash://sup-standby/ 16384    Oct 30 17:05:32 2020  lost+found/ 1964291584    Dec 08 19:44:33 2020  nxos.10.1.1.bin ... Usage for bootflash://sup-standby 4825743360 bytes used 16312102912 bytes free 21137846272 bytes total  ``` |
| **Step 6** | If you need more space on the standby supervisor module, delete any unnecessary files to make space available.  ``` switch# delete bootflash://sup-standby/nxos.9.2.1.bin   ``` |
| **Step 7** | Log in to Cisco.com, choose the software image file for your device from the following URL, and download it to a file server: <http://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html>. |
| **Step 8** | Copy the software image to the active supervisor module using a transfer protocol. You can use FTP, TFTP, SCP, or SFTP.  ``` switch# copy scp://user@scpserver.cisco.com//download/nxos64.10.2.1.F.bin bootflash:nxos64.10.2.1.F.bin  ```   For software images requiring compaction, you must use SCP, HTTP, or HTTPS as the source and bootflash or USB as the destination. The following example uses SCP and bootflash:  ``` switch# copy scp://user@scpserver.cisco.com//download/nxos64.10.2.1.F.bin  bootflash:nxos64.10.2.1.F.bin compact vrf management use-kstack  user1@10.65.42.196's password: nxos64.10.2.1.F.bin 100% 1887MB 6.6MB/s 04:47 Copy complete, now saving to disk (please wait)... Copy complete.   ```  The compact  keyword compacts the NX-OS image before copying the file to the supervisor module.   | **Note** | Software image compaction is only supported on SCP, HTTP, or HTTPS. If you attempt compaction with any other protocol, the system returns the following error:  ``` Compact option is allowed only with source as scp/http/https and destination as bootflash or usb ``` | | --- | --- |  | **Note** | Compacted images are not supported with LXC boot mode. | | --- | --- |  | **Note** | Software image compaction is only supported on Cisco Nexus 9300-series platform switches. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 9** | You can detect an incomplete or corrupt NX-OS software image prior to performing an upgrade by verifying the MD5, SHA256 or SHA512 checksum of the software image. To verify the MD5 checksum of the software image, run the show file bootflash:<IMAGE-NAME>md5sum  command and compare the resulting value to the published MD5 checksum for the software image on [Cisco’s Software Download](https://software.cisco.com/download/home) website. To verify the SHA512 checksum of the software image, run the show file bootflash:<IMAGE-NAME>sha512sum  command and compare the resulting value to the published SHA512 checksum for the software image on [Cisco’s Software Download](https://software.cisco.com/download/home) website.  ``` switch# show file bootflash:nxos.10.1.1.bin md5sum 2242a7f876f1304118fd175c66f69b34 ``` ``` switch# show file bootflash:nxos.10.1.1.bin sha512sum 7f25cce57ca137a79211fb3835338aae64acf9b021b75cec5d4156e873b4274ca4f98e9a74fe4c8961f5ace99ed65f3826650599369f84ab07265d7c5d61b57f ``` |
| **Step 10** | You can detect an incomplete or corrupt NX-OS software image prior to performing an upgrade by verifying the MD5, SHA256 or SHA512 checksum of the software image. To verify the MD5 checksum of the software image, run the show file bootflash:<IMAGE-NAME>md5sum  command and compare the resulting value to the published MD5 checksum for the software image on [Cisco’s Software Download](https://software.cisco.com/download/home) website. To verify the SHA512 checksum of the software image, run the show file bootflash:<IMAGE-NAME>sha512sum  command and compare the resulting value to the published SHA512 checksum for the software image on [Cisco’s Software Download](https://software.cisco.com/download/home) website.  ``` switch# show file bootflash:nxos64.10.2.1.F.bin md5sum c49660952215822afd30bb7958a0765a  ``` ``` switch# show file bootflash:nxos64.10.2.1.F.bin sha256sum 2a64efbb381fabbb52054af74cf3efda1691772a49a70ddd35550431cadecf8e  ``` ``` switch# show file bootflash:nxos64.10.2.1.F.bin sha512sum 3bf6a771aa4a192a8e1383e348b26bb483356a9774d74ba39edbf7718248483b3391942d8103de8104deea8fda212266e70bd736220cff34943bd8e359432975  ``` |
| **Step 11** | Check the impact of upgrading the software before actually performing the upgrade.  ``` switch# # show install all impact nxos bootflash:nxos64.10.2.1.F.bin  ```  During the compatibility check, the following ISSU-related messages may appear in the Reason field:      | Reason Field Message | Description | | --- | --- | | Incompatible image for ISSU | The Cisco NX-OS image to which you are attempting to upgrade does not support ISSU. | | Default upgrade is not hitless | By default, the software upgrade process is disruptive. You must configure the non-disruptive option to perform an ISSU. | |
| **Step 12** | Save the running configuration to the startup configuration.  ``` switch# copy running-config startup-config   ``` |
| **Step 13** | If required, upgrade the EPLD image using the install all nxos <nxos-image> epld <epld-image> command.  The following is an example output of the install all nxos <nxos-image> epld <epld-image> command:  ``` switch# install all nxos nxos.10.1.1.bin epld n9000-epld.10.1.1.img  Installer will perform compatibility check first.

| **Step 14** | Upgrade the Cisco NX-OS software using the install all nxos bootflash:filename [no-reload | non-disruptive | non-interruptive | serial]  command.  ``` switch# install all nxos bootflash:nxos64.10.2.1.F.bin  ```   The following options are available:   * no-reload—Exits the software upgrade process before the device reloads.       | **Note** | When you use install all  with no-reload  option, the saved configuration cannot be used before you relaod the device. Saving configuration in this state can result in incorrect startup configuration once you reload the device with new version of NX-OS. |   | --- | --- | * non-disruptive—Performs an in-service software upgrade (ISSU) to prevent the disruption of data traffic. (By default, the software upgrade   process is disruptive.) * non-interruptive—Upgrades the software without any prompts. This option skips all error and sanity checks. * serial—Upgrades the I/O modules in Cisco Nexus 9500 Series switches one at a time. (By default, the I/O modules are upgraded in   parallel, which reduces the overall upgrade time. Specifically, the I/O modules are upgraded in parallel in this order: the   first half of the line cards and fabric modules, the second half of the line cards and fabric modules, the first system controller,   the second system controller.)  | **Note** | If you enter the install all  command without specifying a filename, the command performs a compatibility check, notifies you of the modules that will be upgraded, and confirms that you want to continue with the installation. If you choose to proceed, it installs the NX-OS software image that is currently running on the switch and upgrades the BIOS of various modules from the running image, if necessary. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 15** | (Optional) Display the entire upgrade process.  ``` switch# show install all status   ``` |
| **Step 16** | (Optional) Log in and verify that the device is running the required software version.  ``` switch# show version   ``` |
| **Step 17** | (Optional) If necessary, install any licenses to ensure that the required features are available on the device. See the [Cisco NX-OS Licensing Guide](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/sw/nx-os/licensing/guide/b_Cisco_NX-OS_Licensing_Guide.html). |

## Upgrade Process for vPCs

* [Upgrade Process for a vPC Topology on the Primary Switch](#Cisco_Concept.dita_96691f86-15bb-4465-afc3-aa6f5707acc1)
* [Upgrade Process for a vPC Topology on the Secondary Switch](#Cisco_Concept.dita_3c739246-afb9-4137-a725-71985acf8e43)

### Upgrade Process for a vPC Topology on the Primary Switch

The following list summarizes the upgrade process on a switch in a vPC topology that holds either the Primary or Operational
Primary vPC roles. Steps that differ from a switch upgrade in a non-vPC topology are in bold.

| **Note** | ---   In vPC topologies, the two peer switches must be upgraded individually. An upgrade on one peer switch does not automatically update the vPC peer switch.  In a dual-homed non-vPC access network (either a triangle or Y shaped access network), with or without STP configured, with BFD enabled and with HSRP configured on the SVIs and with HSRP configured as BFD client, transient traffic may drop for both IPv4 native unicast and/or labeled traffic after performing an ND-ISSU n fallback mode.  To counter this, configure in all the HSRP IPv4 groups for all the HSRP enabled SVIs the **timer 2 120** on both HSRP peers prior to performing the ND-ISSU. The configuration of the **timer 3 120** may lead to traffic loss.   --- |
| --- | --- |

1. **The install all command issued on the vPC primary switch triggers the installation upgrade.**
2. The compatibility checks display the impact of the upgrade.
3. The installation proceeds or not based on the upgrade impact.
4. **The configuration is locked on both vPC peer switches.**
5. The current state is saved.
6. The system unloads and runs the new image.
7. The stateful restart of the system software and application occurs.
8. The installer resumes with the new image.
9. The installation is complete.

When the installation is complete, the vPC primary switch is upgraded.

| **Note** | ---   The vPC primary switch is running the upgraded version, and the vPC secondary switch is running the original software version.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Upgrade Process for a vPC Topology on the Secondary Switch

The following list summarizes the upgrade process on a switch in a vPC topology that holds either the Secondary or Operational
Secondary vPC roles. Steps that differ from a switch upgrade in a non-vPC topology are in bold.

1. **The install all command issued on the vPC secondary switch triggers the installation upgrade.**
2. The compatibility checks display the impact of the upgrade.
3. The installation proceeds or not based on the upgrade impact.
4. The current state is saved.
5. The system unloads and runs the new image.
6. The stateful restart of the system software and application occurs.
7. The installer resumes with the new image.
8. **The configuration is unlocked on the primary and secondary switches.**
9. The installation is complete.

## Cisco NX-OS Upgrade History

During the life of a Cisco Nexus 9000 switch, many upgrade procedures can be performed. Upgrades can occur for maintenance
purposes or to update the operating system to obtain new features. Over time, switches may be updated on numerous occasions.
Viewing the types of upgrades and when they occurred can help in troubleshooting issues or simply understanding the history
of the switch.

Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(5), Cisco Nexus 9000 switches log all upgrade activity performed over time providing
a comprehensive history of these events. The stored upgrade history types are:

* Cisco NX-OS System Upgrades
* Electronic Programmable Logic Device (EPLD) Upgrades
* Software Maintenance Upgrade (SMU) Installations

View the Cisco NX-OS upgrade history by entering the show upgrade history  command. The output displays any upgrade activity that previously occurred on the switch and defines the start and end times
for each event. The following is an example output of the show upgrade history  command:

```
switch# show upgrade history
TYPE                VERSION   DATE                    STATUS
NXOS EPLD           n9000-    26 Apr 2020 11:37:16    EPLD Upgrade completed

                                                      ALL-1.0.0-9.3.5.lib32_n9000.rpm
NXOS SMU            9.3(5)    03 Mar 2020 23:34:03    Patch activation started for
                                                      nxos.libnbproxycli_patch-n9k_
                                                      ALL-1.0.0-9.3.5.lib32_n9000.rpm

```

Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 10.2(3)F, Cisco Nexus 9000 switches supports new cli "show upgrade history details " which displays login details (user name/session ID).

View the Cisco NX-OS upgrade history details by entering the show upgrade history details  command. The output displays user login details (user name/session ID) under LOGIN column on the switch along with upgrade
history. The following is an example output of the show upgrade history details  command:

```
switch# sh upgrade history details
     TYPE          VERSION                                  DATE                  LOGIN                          STATUS
NXOS system image  10.2(3)                   21 Jan 2022 10:01:06     admin/10.30.216.212        Installation End
NXOS system image  10.2(3)                   21 Jan 2022 10:00:53     admin/10.30.216.212        Installation started
NXOS system image  10.2(3)                   21 Jan 2022 01:03:52     admin/10.30.216.212        Installation End

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

Bias-Free Language

### Bias-Free Language

The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product.

Bias-Free Language

### Bias-Free Language

The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product. [Learn more](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/social-justice/inclusive-language-policy.html) about how Cisco is using Inclusive Language.

### Firmware Image Management

Cisco delivers all firmware updates to Cisco UCS components in bundles of images. Each image represents an individual firmware package specific to one hardware component.
For example: IOM image, Cisco UCS Manager image, and so on.Cisco UCS firmware updates are available to be downloaded to fabric interconnects in a Cisco UCS domain in the following bundles:

Cisco UCS Infrastructure
Software Bundle

Cisco UCS Manager Release 4.0 and later releases contain four separate infrastructure bundles:

These bundles include firmware images that are required to update the following components:

* Cisco UCS Manager software
* Kernel and system firmware for the fabric interconnects
* I/O module/FI-IO module firmware

  | **Note** | ---   Cisco UCS X-Series Direct, Cisco UCS 6500 Series Fabric Interconnects, Cisco UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects do not have separate kickstart and system images.   --- |
  | --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   The UCS infrastructure bundle for one platform cannot be used to activate another platform. For example, the infrastructure bundle for the UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnect cannot be used to activate the Cisco UCS X-Series Direct, Cisco UCS 6500 Series Fabric Interconnects, and Cisco UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Cisco UCS B-Series Blade
Server Software Bundle

This bundle includes the following firmware images that are required to update the firmware for the blade servers in a Cisco UCS domain. In addition to the bundles created for a release, these bundles can also be released between infrastructure bundles to enable
Cisco UCS Manager to support a blade server that is not included in the most recent infrastructure bundle.

* CIMC firmware
* BIOS firmware
* Adapter firmware
* Board controller firmware
* Third-party firmware images required by the new server

Cisco UCS C-Series
Rack-Mount UCS-Managed Server Software Bundle

This bundle includes the following firmware images that are required to update components on rack-mount servers that have
been integrated with and are managed by Cisco UCS Manager:

* CIMC firmware
* BIOS firmware
* Adapter firmware
* Storage controller firmware

| **Note** | ---   You cannot use this bundle for standalone C-series servers. The firmware management system in those servers cannot interpret the header required by Cisco UCS Manager. For information on how to upgrade standalone C-series servers, see the C-series configuration guides.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Cisco also provides release notes, which you can obtain on the same website from which you obtained the bundles.

| **Caution** | ---   Ensure that before starting the auto-install process, you capture the data according to [Verification that the Data Path is Ready](m_prerequisites_guidelines.html#concept_7406EAC0852E4A52968DFBAE84E1A1C8).   * Before acknowledging the pending activity during auto-install, it is important to confirm that all the subordinate VIF paths   are rebuilt. * Ensure that you monitor the UCS VIF paths only from the CLI and not from the faults within the UCS Manager GUI. * If you fail to monitor the UCS VIF paths, it may result in partial or complete "All Paths Down" state.   We recommend that you follow the guidelines prior to any processes that require reboot of both Fabric Interconnects.   --- |
| --- | --- |

* [Firmware Image Headers](#concept_2474DE9D2048450CA1A37A8A3D3EE597)
* [Firmware Image Catalog](#concept_BFBD7B2A13024609878609B5A1653C2C)

#### Firmware Image Headers

Every firmware image has a header, which includes the following:

* Checksum
* Version information
* Compatibility information that the system can use to verify the compatibility of component images and any dependencies

#### Firmware Image Catalog

Cisco UCS Manager
maintains an inventory of all available images. The image catalog contains a
list of images and packages. A package is a read-only object that is created
when it is downloaded. It does not occupy disk space and represents a list or
collection of images that were unpacked as part of the package download. When
an individual image is downloaded, the package name remains the same as the
image name.

Cisco UCS Manager
provides you with two views of the catalog of firmware images and their
contents that have been downloaded to the fabric interconnect:

Packages

This view
provides you with a read-only representation of the firmware bundles that have
been downloaded onto the fabric interconnect. This view is sorted by image, not
by the contents of the image. For packages, you can use this view to see which
component images are in each downloaded firmware bundle.

Images

The images view
lists the component images available on the system. You cannot use this view to
see complete firmware bundles or to group the images by bundle. The information
available about each component image includes the name of the component, the
image size, the image version, and the vendor and model of the component.

You can use this
view to identify the firmware updates available for each component. You can
also use this view to delete obsolete and unneeded images. After all the images
in the package have been deleted,
Cisco UCS Manager deletes the package itself.

| **Tip** | ---   Cisco UCS Manager stores the images in bootflash on the fabric interconnect. In a cluster system, space usage in bootflash on both fabric interconnects is the same, because all images are synchronized between them. Faults are raised when the bootflash partition exceeds 70 percent and total used space exceeds 90 percent. If Cisco UCS Manager generates such a fault, delete obsolete images to free up space.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### What to do next

Download the software bundles to the fabric interconnect.

### Downloading Firmware Images to the Fabric Interconnect from a Remote Location

| **Note** | ---   In a cluster setup, the image file for the firmware bundle is downloaded to both fabric interconnects, regardless of which fabric interconnect is used to initiate the download. Cisco UCS Manager maintains all firmware packages and images in both fabric interconnects in sync. If one fabric interconnect is down, the download finishes successfully. The images are synced to the other fabric interconnect when it comes back online.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Before you begin

Obtain the required firmware bundles from Cisco.

#### Procedure

---

|  |  |

This can be one of the following:   * FTP * TFTP       | **Note** | The TFTP file size limitation is 32 MB. Because firmware bundles can be much larger, Cisco recommends that you do not choose TFTP for firmware downloads. |   | --- | --- | * SCP * SFTP * USB   A—The USB drive inserted into fabric interconnect A. * USB B—The USB drive inserted into fabric   interconnect B.  | **Note** | USB A and USB B are applicable only for Cisco UCS 6324 (UCS Mini) and Cisco UCS 6300 Series fabric interconnects.  For Cisco UCS 6300 Series fabric interconnects, only the first of the two ports is detected. | | --- | --- | | | Server field | If the file came from a remote server, this is the IP address or hostname of the remote server on which the files resides. If the file came from a local source, this field displays "local".   | **Note** | If you use a hostname rather than an IPv4 or IPv6 address, you must configure a DNS server. If the Cisco UCS domain is not registered with Cisco UCS Central or DNS management is set to local, configure a DNS server in Cisco UCS Manager. If the Cisco UCS domain is registered with Cisco UCS Central and DNS management is set to global, configure a DNS server in Cisco UCS Central. | | --- | --- | | | Filename field | The name of the firmware file. | | Path field | The absolute path to the file on the remote server.  If you use SCP, the absolute path is always required. If you use any other protocol, you may not need to specify a remote path if the file resides in the default download folder. For details about how your file server is configured, contact your system administrator. | | User field | The username the system should use to log in to the remote server. This field does not apply if the protocol is TFTP. | | Password field | The password for the remote server username. This field does not apply if the protocol is TFTP. | |
| **Step 7** | Click OK.  Cisco UCS Manager GUI begins downloading the firmware bundle to the fabric interconnect. |
| **Step 8** | (Optional) Monitor the status of the download on the Download Tasks tab.   | **Note** | If Cisco UCS Manager reports that the bootflash is out of space, delete obsolete bundles on the Packages tab to free up space. To view the available space in bootflash, navigate to the fabric interconnect, click Equipment, and expand the Local Storage Information area on the General tab. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 9** | Repeat this task until all the required firmware bundles have been downloaded to the fabric interconnect. |

---

#### What to do next

After the image file for the firmware bundles download
completes, update the firmware on the endpoints.

### Downloading Firmware Images to the Fabric Interconnect from the Local File System

| **Note** | ---   In a cluster setup, the image file for the firmware bundle is downloaded to both fabric interconnects, regardless of which fabric interconnect is used to initiate the download. Cisco UCS Manager maintains all firmware packages and images in both fabric interconnects in sync. If one fabric interconnect is down, the download finishes successfully. The images are synced to the other fabric interconnect when it comes back online.   --- |

| **Step 9** | (Optional) Monitor the status of the firmware bundle download on the Download Tasks tab.   | **Note** | If Cisco UCS Manager reports that the bootflash is out of space, delete obsolete bundles on the Packages tab to free up space. To view the available space in bootflash, navigate to the fabric interconnect on the Equipment tab and expand the Local Storage Information area on the General tab. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 10** | Repeat this task until all the required firmware bundles have been downloaded to the fabric interconnect. |

---

#### What to do next

After the image file for the firmware bundles download
completes, update the firmware on the endpoints.

### Canceling an Image Download

You can cancel the download task for an image only while it is
in progress. After the image has downloaded, deleting the download task does
not delete the image that was downloaded. You cannot cancel the FSM related to
the image download task.

---

### Checking Conformance of the Contents of a Firmware Package

You can use the Check Conformance feature to verify that all your components are running the correct firmware version for
the bundle selected. This should not be used before a firmware upgrade is performed, but after the upgrade is completed.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the Navigation pane, click Equipment. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the Equipment node. |
| **Step 3** | In the Work pane, click the Firmware Management tab. |
| **Step 4** | In the Packages subtab, select the package that you want to check for conformance. |
| **Step 5** | Click Check Conformance. |
| **Step 6** | In the dialog box that appears, the Message column describes whether each component is in conformance with the firmware package. |

---

### Checking the Available Space on a Fabric Interconnect

If an image download
fails, check whether the bootflash on the fabric interconnect or fabric
interconnects in the
Cisco UCS has sufficient available space.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the Navigation pane, click Equipment. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Expand Equipment > Fabric Interconnects. |
| **Step 3** | Click the fabric interconnect on which you want to check the available space. |
| **Step 4** | In the Work pane, click the General tab. |
| **Step 5** | Expand the Local Storage Information area.  When you download a firmware image bundle, a fabric interconnect needs at least twice as much available space as the size of the firmware image bundle. If the bootflash does not have sufficient space, delete the obsolete firmware, core files, and tech support files from the fabric interconnect. |

---

## Firmware Upgrades through Auto Install

Auto Install enables you to upgrade a Cisco UCS domain to the firmware versions contained in a single package in the following stages:

* Install Infrastructure Firmware—Uses the Cisco UCS Infrastructure
  Software Bundle to upgrade the infrastructure components, such as the fabric interconnects, the I/O modules, and Cisco UCS Manager. [Firmware Image Management](#concept_cfq_2gr_zdb), provides details about the available infrastructure software bundles in Cisco UCS Manager Release 4.0. [Recommended Process for Upgrading Infrastructure Firmware Through Auto Install](#concept_4C149CFE097D44A7B38CB1705FE0ADC5), details the process that Cisco recommends for automatically installing infrastructure firmware.
* Install Chassis Firmware—Uses the Cisco UCS C-Series
  Rack-Mount UCS-Managed Server Software Bundle to upgrade the chassis components.
* Install Server
  Firmware—Uses the Cisco UCS B-Series Blade
  Server Software Bundle to upgrade all blade servers in the Cisco UCS domain; the Cisco UCS C-Series
  Rack-Mount UCS-Managed Server Software Bundle to upgrade all rack servers.

These stages are independent and can be run or scheduled to run at different times.

You can use Auto Install to upgrade the infrastructure components to one version of Cisco UCS and upgrade the chassis and  server components to a different version.

| **Note** | ---   You cannot use Auto Install to upgrade either the infrastructure or the servers in a Cisco UCS domain if Cisco UCS Manager in that domain is at a release prior to Cisco UCS 2.1(1). However, after you upgrade Cisco UCS Manager to Release 2.1(1) or greater, you can use Auto Install to upgrade the remaining components in a Cisco UCS domain that is at the minimum required firmware level. For more information, see [Cautions, and Guidelines for Upgrading with Auto Install](m_prerequisites_guidelines.html#concept_26C3DE95098A45C8AA654F6047253E4A).   --- |
| --- | --- |

In Cisco UCS Manager Releases 3.1(1l), 3.1(2b), 3.1(2c), and 3.1(2e), activating the Cisco UCS Manager software through Auto Install fails if the power policy is configured with Redundancy set to Grid and Power Capping set to No Cap. In Cisco UCS Manager releases earlier than Cisco UCS Manager Release 3.1(2b) and later than 3.1(2e), activating the Cisco UCS Manager software through Auto Install no longer fails based on the configured power policy.

If you upgrade or downgrade a fabric interconnect in the following modes, the Cisco UCS Manager requests you to acknowledge for an fabric interconnect reboot:

* Cluster mode with two fabric interconnects
* Standalone mode with a single fabric interconnect

* [Direct Upgrade After Auto Install](#concept_940BC088DE7E4C21AA245B445287710E)
* [Automatic Internal Backup](#concept_0BF5B3DB97584AA4954524496223687D)

### Direct Upgrade After Auto Install

During
Auto Install,
the startup version of the default infrastructure pack is configured. To
successfully complete a direct upgrade or activation of
Cisco UCS Manager,
Fabric Interconnects, and IOMs after
Auto Install,
ensure that the startup version is cleared before starting direct upgrade or
activation. If the startup version of the default infrastructure pack is
configured, you cannot directly upgrade or activate
Cisco UCS Manager,
Fabric Interconnects, and IOMs.
[Clearing the Startup Version of the Default Infrastructure Pack and the Service Pack](#task_E520065F0BC44A51BBD86D67FC57ECE5),
provides detailed steps for clearing the startup version.

### **Automatic Internal Backup**

| **Note** | ---   Beginning with release 4.2(3d), Cisco UCS Manager introduces Password Encryption Key to enhance security for backup configuration files.  If you do not set Password Encryption Key, then Automatic Internal Backup also fails. For more information on how to set Password Encryption Key, see Setting Password Encryption Key for Locally Authenticated Users section in [Cisco UCS Manager Administration Management Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/servers-unified-computing/ucs-manager/products-installation-and-configuration-guides-list.html) for your release.   --- |
| --- | --- |

While the Infrastructure firmware is being upgraded, an automatic full state backup file is created. Cisco UCS Manager Release 2.2(4) introduced two new backup stages that are visible in the FSM status. These are:

1. InternalBackup—Backs up the configuration.
2. PollInternalBackup—Waits for the backup to complete.

After the backup is
successfully completed, the backup file, named as "bkp.timestamp.tgz", is
stored within the
/workspace/backup directory of both the fabric
interconnects. This location contains only the latest backup file.

If the backup fails,
a minor fault stating "internal backup failed" is logged. This fault is not
logged in case of downgrade to a release prior to
Cisco UCS Manager
Release 2.2(4).

Before restoring the
configuration for a fabric interconnect from this backup file, copy it from the
fabric interconnect to a file server by using the
copy
command from local-mgmt.

This example shows
how to copy the automatic internal backup file to a file server:

```
UCS-A# connect local-mgmt
UCS-A (local-mgmt) # copy workspace:/backup/bkp.1429690478.tgz scp://builds@10.190.120.2://home/builds/

```

### Prepare for Firmware Install

You can use Auto Install to upgrade a Cisco UCS domain to the firmware versions contained in a single package. Auto Install
provides the ability to install firmware in three independent phases—Install Infrastructure Firmware, Install Chassis Firmware,
and Install Server Firmware. During Auto Install, the firmware for some endpoints such as the IOMs, adapters, BIOS and CIMC
are first updated and then activated.

Updating the firmware on an endpoint involves staging the firmware image to the backup partition on an endpoint. The update
phase does not require or cause reboot of the endpoint. During activation, you set the firmware in the backup partition as
the active firmware version on the endpoint. Activation can require or cause the reboot of an endpoint. Therefore, the time
taken to complete the Auto Install process includes the time required to do the following:

* Update or stage firmware to the backup partition of all endpoints

  | **Note** | ---   This process takes most of the time spent to complete Auto Install.   --- |
  | --- | --- |
* Activate firmware on all the endpoints
* Reboot all applicable endpoints

Cisco UCS Manager Release 3.2(3) introduces the ability to update or stage the firmware of infrastructure, server components,
and S3260 chassis simultaneously, and keep it independent of the activation process. Because staging firmware does not involve rebooting any
endpoints, this ability allows you to stage the firmware on all endpoints without waiting for a maintenance window. Consequently,
the time taken to complete the Auto Install process no longer includes the time taken to stage firmware to the backup partition
of all endpoints. You can, thus, significantly reduce the downtime required for maintenance.

If you stage the firmware using this feature before performing Auto Install, you can skip backup updates and proceed with
firmware activation and endpoint reboots. If you do not stage the firmware on the endpoints through this feature, you can
continue to use Auto Install to update and activate the components. The ability to stage firmware to the backup partition
of endpoints does not change the legacy ability of Auto Install to update and activate the firmware of components.

### Install Infrastructure Firmware

Install Infrastructure Firmware upgrades all infrastructure components in a Cisco UCS domain, including Cisco UCS Manager, and all fabric interconnects and I/O modules. All components are upgraded to the firmware version included in the selected
Cisco UCS Infrastructure
Software Bundle.

Install Infrastructure Firmware
does not support a partial upgrade to only some infrastructure components in a
Cisco UCS domain
domain.

You can schedule an
infrastructure upgrade for a specific time to accommodate a maintenance window.
However, if an infrastructure upgrade is already in progress, you cannot
schedule another infrastructure upgrade. You must wait until the current
upgrade is complete before scheduling the next one.

| **Note** | ---   You can cancel an infrastructure firmware upgrade if it is scheduled to occur at a future time. However, you cannot cancel an infrastructure firmware upgrade after the upgrade has begun.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Install Server Firmware

Install Server
Firmware
uses host firmware packages to upgrade all servers and their components in a
Cisco UCS domain.
All servers whose service profiles include the selected host firmware packages
are upgraded to the firmware versions in the selected software bundles, as
follows:

* Cisco UCS B-Series Blade
  Server Software Bundle
  for all blade servers in the chassis.
* Cisco UCS C-Series
  Rack-Mount UCS-Managed Server Software Bundle
  for all rack-mount servers that are integrated into the
  Cisco UCS domain.

| **Note** | ---   You cannot cancel a server firmware upgrade process after you complete the configuration in the Install Server Firmware wizard. Cisco UCS Manager applies the changes immediately. However, the timing of the actual reboot of servers occurs depends upon the maintenance policy in the service profile associated with the server.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Required Order of Steps for Auto Install

If you want to upgrade all components in a Cisco UCS domain to the same package version, you must run the stages of Auto Install in the following order:

1. Install Infrastructure Firmware
2. Install Server
   Firmware

This order enables you to schedule the server firmware upgrades during a different maintenance window than the infrastructure
firmware upgrade.

### Recommended Process for Upgrading Infrastructure Firmware Through Auto Install

### Upgrading the Infrastructure Firmware with Auto Install

The
Firmware
Auto Install tab is not available if the
Cisco UCS Manager GUI
is at a release lower than 2.1(1).

| **Note** | ---   You cannot use Auto Install to upgrade either the infrastructure or the servers in a Cisco UCS domain if Cisco UCS Manager in that domain is at a release prior to Cisco UCS Manager 2.1(1). However, after you upgrade Cisco UCS Manager to Release 2.1(1) or greater, you can use Auto Install to upgrade the remaining components in a Cisco UCS domain that is at the minimum required firmware level. For more information, see [Cautions, and Guidelines for Upgrading with Auto Install](m_prerequisites_guidelines.html#concept_26C3DE95098A45C8AA654F6047253E4A), and the appropriate Cisco UCS upgrade guide.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Beginning with
Cisco UCS Manager
Release 3.1(3), you can use
Auto Install
to install a service pack on
Cisco UCS Manager
and both fabric interconnects. You can apply a service pack on a base
infrastructure pack, but you cannot install the service pack independently.

You can install a
compatible service pack through
Auto Install
without upgrading the infrastructure pack. This will trigger service pack
installation on both fabric interconnects. Certain service pack installations
may require the fabric interconnects to be reloaded.

Auto Install
of infrastructure firmware using a service pack is supported only when all the
infrastructure components are at
Cisco UCS Manager
Release 3.1(3) or later releases.

#### Before you begin

* Complete all prerequisites listed in [Prerequisites for Upgrading and Downgrading Firmware](m_prerequisites_guidelines.html#concept_DD68485034FB4E258D5827880D37225C).
* Stage the Infrastructure firmware if using Cisco UCS Manager Release 3.2(3) or later releases. [Preparing for Firmware Install](#task_umz_3rj_gcb), provides detailed information about staging the infrastructure firmware.

  | **Note** | ---   Although this is optional, it is also recommended.   --- |
  | --- | --- |

If your
Cisco UCS domain does not use an NTP server to set the time, make sure that the
clocks on the primary and secondary fabric interconnects are in sync. You can
do this by configuring an NTP server in
Cisco UCS Manager
or by syncing the time manually.

#### Procedure

---

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | In the Navigation pane, click Equipment. |
| **Step 2** | Click the Equipment node. |

| **Step 6** | In the Prerequisites page of the Install Infrastructure Firmware dialog box, ensure that you address the warnings before proceeding.  Warnings are given in the following categories:   * Whether there are any current critical or major faults. * Whether a configuration backup has been taken recently. * Whether the management interface monitoring policy is enabled. * Whether there is pending fabric interconnect reboot activity. * Whether NTP is configured.   You can click the hyperlinks for each warning to address them directly. Check the checkbox for each warning that you have addressed, or check the Ignore All checkbox to continue without addressing the warnings. |
| **Step 7** | In the Properties area of the Install Infrastructure Firmware dialog box, complete the following fields:      | Name | Description | | --- | --- | | Name field | The name of the infrastructure pack created and maintained by Cisco UCS. You cannot change the default name in this field or create a custom infrastructure pack. | | Description field | A user-defined description of the infrastructure pack. This field is completed by default. However, you can enter your own description if you prefer.  Enter up to 256 characters. You can use any characters or spaces except ` (accent mark), \ (backslash), ^ (carat), " (double quote), = (equal sign), > (greater than), < (less than), or ' (single quote). | | Backup Version field | The firmware version staged through Prepare for Firmware Install.  If the firmware version is not staged, this field is empty. | | Infra Pack drop-down list | A list of the software bundles that are available for you to upgrade the firmware on the infrastructure components.  If the Infra Pack version is different from the Backup Version, the downtime will include the time taken to stage and then activate the selected infra pack version.  If the Infra Pack version is the same as the Backup Version, the downtime will include the time taken to activate the selected infra pack version. | | Service Pack drop-down list | A list of the service pack bundles that are available for you to upgrade the firmware on the infrastructure components.  You cannot directly upgrade to a service pack without selecting a base infra pack.   | **Note** | A service pack can be applied only on its base maintenance release. For example, service pack 3.1(3)SP2 can be applied only on a 3.1(3) release. It cannot be applied on a 3.1(4) release. | | --- | --- |   Setting Service Pack to <not set> removes the service pack from the firmware package. | | Force check box | If checked, Cisco UCS attempts the installation even if a previous attempt to install the selected version failed or was interrupted. | | Evacuate checkbox | If checked, Fabric Evacuation is enabled on each fabric interconnect that is being upgraded through Auto Install. Both fabric interconnects are evacuated, but not at the same time.  By default, this checkbox is unchecked, and fabric evacuation is disabled. | |
| **Step 8** | In the Infrastructure Upgrade Schedule area of the Install Infrastructure Firmware dialog box, do one of the following:      | Option | Description | | --- | --- | | Start Time field | The date and time that the occurrence will run.  Click the down arrow at the end of the field to select the date from a calendar. | | Upgrade Now check box | If checked, Cisco UCS Manager ignores the Start Time field and upgrades the infrastructure firmware as soon as you click OK. | |
| **Step 9** | Click OK.  The Firmware Installer field on the Firmware Auto Install tab displays the status of the infrastructure firmware upgrade.   | **Note** | If there is not enough space under bootflash, a warning will display and the upgrade process will stop. | | --- | --- | |

---

#### What to do next

Acknowledge the reboot of the primary fabric interconnect. If
you do not acknowledge that reboot,
Cisco UCS Manager
cannot complete the infrastructure upgrade and the upgrade remains pending
indefinitely.

Certain service pack installations may require the fabric interconnects to be reloaded. In such scenarios, you must acknowledge
the reboot of the primary fabric interconnect to complete the service pack installation.

### Acknowledging the Reboot of the Primary Fabric Interconnect

 You can use the steps
detailed here, or click
Play on this
[video](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/ucs/ucs-manager/videos/3-1/acknowledge_pending_reboot_of_the_primary_fabric_interconnect.html)
(http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified\_computing/ucs/ucs-manager/videos/3-1/acknowledge\_pending\_reboot\_of\_the\_primary\_fabric\_interconnect.html)
to watch how to acknowledge the reboot of the primary fabric interconnect.

#### Before you begin

| **Caution** | ---   To upgrade with minimal disruption, you must confirm the following:   * Ensure that   all the IOMs that are attached to the fabric interconnect are up before you   acknowledge the reboot of the fabric interconnect. If all IOMs are not up, all   the servers connected to the fabric interconnect will immediately be   re-discovered, resulting in a major disruption. * Ensure that   both of the fabric interconnects and the service profiles are configured for   failover. * Verify that   the data path has been successfully restored from the secondary fabric   interconnect before you acknowledge the reboot of the primary fabric   interconnect. For more information, see   [Verification that the Data Path is Ready](m_prerequisites_guidelines.html#concept_7406EAC0852E4A52968DFBAE84E1A1C8).   After you upgrade the infrastructure firmware, Install Infrastructure Firmware automatically reboots the secondary fabric interconnect in a cluster configuration. However, you must acknowledge the reboot of the primary fabric interconnect. If you do not acknowledge the reboot, Install Infrastructure Firmware waits indefinitely for that acknowledgment rather than completing the upgrade.   --- |

### Upgrading the Server Firmware with Auto Install

You can perform a bulk upgrade of blade servers or rack-mount servers through this procedure.

If you staged the server firmware through Prepare for Firmware Install, and that backup version is the same as the selected server firmware version in this procedure, the backup version is set
as the startup version.

If you did not set the backup version earlier, the selected firmware version is set as the backup version. This version is
then set as the startup version.

Completing this stage will result in a reboot.

| **Note** | ---   You cannot use Auto Install to upgrade either the infrastructure or the servers in a Cisco UCS domain if Cisco UCS Manager in that domain is at a release prior to Cisco UCS Manager 2.1(1). However, after you upgrade Cisco UCS Manager to Release 2.1(1) or greater, you can use Auto Install to upgrade the remaining components in a Cisco UCS domain that is at the minimum required firmware level. For more information, see [Cautions, and Guidelines for Upgrading with Auto Install](m_prerequisites_guidelines.html#concept_26C3DE95098A45C8AA654F6047253E4A), and the appropriate Cisco UCS upgrade guide.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   You cannot cancel a server firmware upgrade process after you complete the configuration in the Install Server Firmware wizard. Cisco UCS Manager applies the changes immediately. However, the timing of the actual reboot of servers occurs depends upon the maintenance policy in the service profile associated with the server.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Before you begin

## Firmware Upgrades through Firmware Packages in Service Profiles

You can use firmware
packages in service profiles to upgrade the server and adapter firmware,
including the BIOS on the server, by defining a host firmware policy and
including it in the service profile associated with a server.

You cannot upgrade the
firmware on an I/O module, fabric interconnect, or
Cisco UCS Manager
through service profiles. You must upgrade the firmware on those endpoints
directly.

### Host Firmware Package

This policy enables
you to specify a set of firmware versions that make up the host firmware
package (also known as the host firmware pack). The host firmware package
includes the following firmware for server and adapter endpoints:

* Adapter
* BIOS
* CIMC

  | **Note** | ---   For rack mount servers, if you exclude CIMC from the host firmware pack, and upgrade or downgrade the board controller, the upgrade or downgrade may fail. This is because the CIMC firmware version and board controller firmware version may be incompatible.   --- |
  | --- | --- |
* Board Controller
* Flex Flash
  Controller
* GPUs
* FC Adapters
* HBA Option ROM
* Host NIC
* Host NIC Option
  ROM
* Local Disk

  | **Note** | ---   Local Disk is excluded by default from the host firmware pack.  In Cisco UCS Manager Release 3.1(1), to update local disk firmware, always include the Blade Package in the host firmware package. The blade package contains the local disk firmware for blade and rack servers. Starting with Cisco UCS Manager Release 3.1(2), the firmware for local disk and other common endpoints is available in both the blade and rack packages.   --- |
  | --- | --- |
* PSU
* SAS Expander

| **Tip** | ---   You can include more than one type of firmware in the same host firmware package. For example, a host firmware package can include both BIOS firmware and storage controller firmware or adapter firmware for two different models of adapters. However, you can only have one firmware version with the same type, vendor, and model number. The system recognizes which firmware version is required for an endpoint and ignores all other firmware versions.   --- |
| --- | --- |

You can also exclude
firmware of specific components from a host firmware package either when
creating a new host firmware package or when modifying an existing host
firmware package. For example, if you do not want to upgrade BIOS firmware
through the host firmware package, you can exclude BIOS firmware from the list
of firmware package components.

| **Important** | ---   Each host firmware package is associated with one list of excluded components, which is common across all firmware packages—Blade, and Rack. To configure a separate exclusion list for each type of firmware package, use separate host firmware packages.   --- |
| --- | --- |

The firmware package
is pushed to all servers associated with service profiles that include this
policy.

This policy ensures
that the host firmware is identical on all servers associated with service
profiles that use the same policy. Therefore, if you move the service profile
from one server to another, the firmware versions are maintained. Also, if you
change the firmware version for an endpoint in the firmware package, new
versions are applied to all the affected service profiles immediately. This
could cause server reboots.

You must include this
policy in a service profile, and that service profile must be associated with a
server for it to take effect.

This policy is not
dependent upon any other policies. However, you must ensure that the
appropriate firmware has been downloaded to the fabric interconnect. If the
firmware image is not available when
Cisco UCS Manager
is associating a server with a service profile,
Cisco UCS Manager
ignores the firmware upgrade and completes the association.

### Stages of a Firmware Upgrade through Firmware Packages in Service Profiles

You can use the host
firmware package policies in service profiles to upgrade server and adapter
firmware.

| **Caution** | ---   Unless you have configured and scheduled a maintenance window, if you modify a host firmware package by adding an endpoint or changing firmware versions for an existing endpoint, Cisco UCS Manager upgrades the endpoints and reboots all servers associated with that firmware package as soon as the changes are saved, disrupting data traffic to and from the servers.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### New Service Profile

For a new service
profile, this upgrade takes place over the following stages:

Firmware
Package Policy Creation

During this
stage, you create the host firmware packages.

 Service
Profile Association

During this
stage, you include the firmware packages in a service profile, and then
associate the service profile with a server. The system pushes the selected
firmware versions to the endpoints. The server must be rebooted to ensure that
the endpoints are running the versions specified in the firmware package.

#### Existing Service Profile

For service profiles
that are associated with servers,
Cisco UCS Manager upgrades the firmware and reboots the server as soon as you save
the changes to the firmware packages' unless you have configured and scheduled
a maintenance window. If you configure and schedule a maintenance window,
Cisco UCS Manager defers the upgrade and server reboot until then.

### Effect of Updates to Firmware Packages in Service Profiles

To update firmware through a
firmware package in a service profile, you need to update the firmware in the
package. What happens after you save the changes to a firmware package depends
upon how the
Cisco UCS domain is configured.

The following table
describes the most common options for upgrading servers with a firmware package
in a service profile.

| Service Profile | Maintenance Policy | Upgrade Actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Firmware package is not included in a service profile or an updating service profile template.  OR  You want to upgrade the firmware without making any changes to the existing service profile or updating service profile template. | No maintenance policy | After you update the firmware package, do one of the following:   * To   reboot and upgrade some or all servers simultaneously, add the firmware package   to one or more service profiles that are associated with servers, or to an   updating service profile template. * To   reboot and upgrade one server at a time, do the following for each server:    1. Create a new service profile and include the firmware package in      that service profile.   2. Disassociate the server from its service profile.   3. Associate the server with the new service profile.   4. After the server has been rebooted and the firmware upgraded,      disassociate the server from the new service profile and associate it with its      original service profile.  | **Caution** | If the original service profile includes a scrub policy, disassociating a service profile may result in data loss when the disk or the BIOS is scrubbed upon association with the new service profile. | | --- | --- | |
| The firmware package is included in one or more service profiles, and the service profiles are associated with one or more servers.  OR  The firmware package is included in an updating service profile template, and the service profiles created from that template are associated with one or more servers. | No maintenance policy  OR  A maintenance policy configured for immediate updates. | The following occurs when you update the firmware package:   1. The    changes to the firmware package take effect as soon as you save them. 2. Cisco UCS    verifies the model numbers and vendor against all servers associated with    service profiles that include this policy. If the model numbers and vendor    match a firmware version in the policy,    Cisco UCS    reboots the servers and updates the firmware.   All servers associated with service profiles that include the firmware package are rebooted at the same time. |
| The firmware package is included in one or more service profiles, and the service profiles are associated with one or more servers.  OR  The firmware package is included in an updating service profile template, and the service profiles created from that template are associated with one or more servers. | Configured for user acknowledgment | The following occurs when you update the firmware package:   1. Cisco UCS    asks you to confirm your change and advises that a user-acknowledged reboot of    the servers is required. 2. Click    the flashing    Pending Activities button to select the servers you    want to reboot and to apply the new firmware. 3. Cisco UCS    verifies the model numbers and vendor against all servers associated with    service profiles that include this policy. If the model numbers and vendor    match a firmware version in the policy,    Cisco UCS    reboots the server and updates the firmware.   A manual reboot of the servers does not cause Cisco UCS to apply the firmware package, nor does it cancel the pending activities. You must acknowledge or cancel the pending activity through the Pending Activities button. |
| The firmware package is included in one or more service profiles, and the service profiles are associated with one or more servers.  OR  The firmware package is included in an updating service profile template, and the service profiles created from that template are associated with one or more servers. | Configured for user acknowledgment with On Next Boot option | The following occurs when you update the firmware package:   1. Cisco UCS    asks you to confirm your change and advises that a user-acknowledged reboot of    the servers is required. 2. To reboot and to apply the    new firmware, do one of the following:    * Click the flashing      Pending Activities button to select the servers you      want to reboot and apply the new firmware.    * Manually reboot the servers. 3. Cisco UCS    verifies the model numbers and vendor against all servers associated with    service profiles that include this policy. If the model numbers and vendor    match a firmware version in the policy,    Cisco UCS    reboots the server and updates the firmware.   A manual reboot of the servers causes Cisco UCS to apply the firmware package. This is enabled by the On Next Boot option. |
| The firmware package is included in one or more service profiles, and the service profiles are associated with one or more servers.  OR  The firmware package is included in an updating service profile template, and the service profiles created from that template are associated with one or more servers. | Configured for changes to take effect during a specific maintenance window. | The following occurs when you update the firmware package:   1. Cisco UCS    asks you to confirm your change and advises that a user-acknowledged reboot of    the servers is required. 2. Click    the flashing    Pending Activities button to select the servers you    want to reboot and to apply the new firmware. 3. Cisco UCS    verifies the model numbers and vendor against all servers associated with    service profiles that include this policy. If the model numbers and vendor    match a firmware version in the policy,    Cisco UCS    reboots the server and updates the firmware.   A manual reboot of the servers does not cause Cisco UCS to apply the firmware package, nor does it cancel the scheduled maintenance activities. |

### Creating a Host Firmware Package

| **Tip** | ---   You can include more than one type of firmware in the same host firmware package. For example, a host firmware package can include both BIOS firmware and storage controller firmware or adapter firmware for two different models of adapters. However, you can only have one firmware version with the same type, vendor, and model number. The system recognizes which firmware version is required for an endpoint and ignores all other firmware versions.   --- |
| --- | --- |

You can also exclude
firmware of specific components from a host firmware package when creating a
new host firmware package.

| **Important** | ---   Each host firmware package is associated with one list of excluded components, which is common across all firmware packages—Blade, and Rack. To configure a separate exclusion list for each type of firmware package, use separate host firmware packages.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Before you begin

Ensure that the appropriate firmware was downloaded to the
fabric interconnect.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the Navigation pane, click Servers. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Expand Servers > Policies. |
| **Step 3** | Expand the node for the organization where you want to create the policy.  If the system does not include multi tenancy, expand the root node. |
| **Step 4** | Right-click Host Firmware Packages and choose Create Package. |
| **Step 5** | In the Create Host Firmware Package dialog box, enter a unique name and description for the package.  This name can be between 1 and 32 alphanumeric characters. You cannot use spaces or any special characters other than - (hyphen), \_ (underscore), : (colon), and . (period), and you cannot change this name after the object is saved. |
| **Step 6** | To configure the host firmware package by selecting servers and components, select the Simple radio button in the How would you like to configure the Host Firmware Package field. |
| **Step 7** | From each drop-down list, Blade Package, Rack Package, and Service Pack, select the firmware package.  The images from Service Pack will take precedence over the images from Blade Package or Rack Package. |
| **Step 8** | In the Excluded Components area, check the checkboxes corresponding to the components that you want to exclude from this host firmware package.  If you do not check any component checkboxes, all the listed components are included in the host firmware package. |
| **Step 9** | To configure the host firmware package with advanced options, select the Advanced radio button in the How would you like to configure the Host Firmware Package field. |
| **Step 10** | On each subtab, do the following for each type of firmware that you want to include in the package:   1. In the    Select column, ensure that the check boxes for the    appropriate lines are checked. 2. In the    Vendor,    Model, and    PID columns, verify that the information matches the    servers you want to update with this package.  The model and model number (PID) must match the servers that are    associated with this firmware package. If you select the wrong model or model    number,    Cisco UCS Manager cannot install the firmware update. 3. In the Version column, choose the firmware version to which you want to update the firmware. |
| **Step 11** | When you have added all the desired firmware to the package, click OK. |

---

#### What to do next

Include the policy in a service profile and/or template.

### Updating a Host Firmware Package

If the policy is included
in one or more service profiles, which do not include maintenance policies,
Cisco UCS Manager updates and activates the firmware in the server and adapter with
the new versions.
Cisco UCS Manager reboots the server as soon as you save the host firmware package
policy unless you have configured and scheduled a maintenance window.

You can also exclude
firmware of specific components from a host firmware package when modifying an
existing host firmware package.

| **Important** | ---   Each host firmware package is associated with one list of excluded components, which is common across all firmware packages—Blade, and Rack. To configure a separate exclusion list for each type of firmware package, use separate host firmware packages.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Before you begin

Ensure that the appropriate firmware was downloaded to the
fabric interconnect.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the Navigation pane, click Servers. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Expand Servers > Policies. |
| **Step 3** | Expand the node for the organization that includes the policy you want to update.  If the system does not include multi tenancy, expand the root node. |
| **Step 4** | Expand Host Firmware Packages and choose the policy you want to update. |
| **Step 5** | In the Work pane, click the General tab. |
| **Step 6** | On each subtab, do the following for each type of firmware that you want to include in the package:   1. In the    Select column, ensure that the check boxes for the    appropriate lines are checked. 2. In the    Vendor,    Model, and    PID columns, verify that the information matches the    servers you want to update with this package.  The model and model number (PID) must match the servers that are    associated with this firmware package. If you select the wrong model or model    number,    Cisco UCS Manager cannot install the firmware update. 3. In the Version column, choose the firmware version to which you want to update the firmware. |
| **Step 7** | To modify the components in the host firmware package, click Modify Package Versions.  The Modify Package Versions window appears. |
| **Step 8** | To modify the blade package, from the Blade Package drop-down list, select the blade package version. |
| **Step 9** | To modify the rack package, from the Rack Package drop-down list, select the rack package version. |
| **Step 10** | To modify the service pack, from the Service Pack drop-down list, select the service pack version.  To remove the service pack, select <not set>. |
| **Step 11** | In the Excluded Components area, check the checkboxes corresponding to the components that you want to exclude from this host firmware package.  If you do not check any component checkboxes, all the listed components are included in the host firmware package. |
| **Step 12** | Click OK.  Cisco UCS Manager verifies the model numbers and vendor against all servers associated with service profiles that include this policy. If the model numbers and vendor match a firmware version in the policy, Cisco UCS Manager updates the firmware according to the settings in the maintenance policies included in the service profiles. |

---

### Adding Firmware Packages to an Existing Service Profile

If the service profile does not include a maintenance policy and
is associated with a server,
Cisco UCS Manager updates and activates the firmware in the server with the new
versions and reboots the server as soon as you save the changes to the service
profile.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the Navigation pane, click Servers. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Expand Servers > Service Profiles. |
| **Step 3** | Expand the node for the organization that includes the service profile that you want to update.  If the system does not include multi tenancy, expand the root node. |
| **Step 4** | Click the service profile to which you want to add the firmware packages. |
| **Step 5** | In the Work pane, click the Policies tab. |
| **Step 6** | Click the down arrows to expand the Firmware Policies section. |
| **Step 7** | To add a host firmware package, select the desired policy from the Host Firmware drop-down list. |
| **Step 8** | Click Save Changes. |

## Firmware Automatic Synchronization

You can use the Firmware Auto Sync Server policy in Cisco UCS Manager to determine whether firmware versions on recently discovered servers must be upgraded or not. With this policy, you can
upgrade the firmware versions of recently discovered unassociated servers to match the firmware version defined in the default
host firmware pack. In addition, you can determine if the firmware upgrade process should run immediately after the server
is discovered, or run at a later time.

| **Important** | ---   The firmware automatic synchronization is dependent on the default host firmware pack. If you delete the default host firmware pack, a major fault is raised in Cisco UCS Manager. If you have configured a default host firmware pack, but not specified or configured a blade or rack server firmware in it, then a minor fault is raised. Irrespective of the severity of the fault raised, you must resolve these faults prior to setting the Firmware Auto Sync Server policy.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   You cannot use the **Firmware Auto Sync Server policy** in the server that is part of a server pool.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Following are the
values for the
Firmware
Auto Sync Server policy:

* No Action—No firmware upgrade is initiated on the server.

  This value is
  selected by default.
* User Acknowledge—Firmware on the server is not synchronized until the administrator acknowledges the upgrade in the Pending Activities dialog box.

You can set this
policy either from the
Cisco UCS Manager GUI
or
Cisco UCS Manager CLI.
The firmware for a server is automatically triggered when the following
conditions occur:

* The firmware
  version on a server or the endpoint on a server differs from the firmware
  version configured in the default host firmware pack.
* The value for the
  Firmware
  Auto Sync Server policy has been modified. For example, if you had
  initially set it as
  User
  Ack and you change it to
  No
  Action.

| **Important** | ---   If Cisco UCS Manager is registered as a Cisco UCS domain with Cisco UCS Central, then this policy runs as a local policy. If the default host firmware pack is not defined in or is deleted from Cisco UCS Manager, then this policy will not run.   --- |
| --- | --- |

* [Setting the Firmware Auto-Sync Server Policy](#task_02A7C051FA734158AF0C673AD37245F3)

### Setting the Firmware Auto-Sync Server Policy

Use this policy to
determine when and how the firmware version of a recently discovered
unassociated server must be updated.

If the firmware
version of a specific endpoint of a server differs from the version in the
default host firmware pack, the FSM state in
Cisco UCS Manager
displays the update status for that specific endpoint only. The firmware
version of the server is not updated.

#### Before you begin

* You should have
  created a default host firmware pack prior to setting this policy.
* You should have
  logged in as an administrator to complete this task.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the Navigation pane, click Equipment. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the Equipment node. |
| **Step 3** | In the Work pane, click the Policies tab. |
| **Step 4** | Click the Global Policies subtab. |
| **Step 5** | In the Firmware Auto Sync Server Policy area, select one of the following values as the Sync State:   * No Action—No firmware upgrade is initiated on the server. * User Acknowledge—Firmware on the server is not synchronized until the administrator acknowledges the upgrade in the Pending Activities dialog box.  This option   is selected by default. |
| **Step 6** | Click Save Changes. |

## Direct Firmware Upgrade at Endpoints

If you follow the correct procedure and apply the upgrades in the correct order, a direct firmware upgrade and the activation
of the new firmware version on the endpoints is minimally disruptive to traffic in a Cisco UCS domain. [Recommended Process for Directly Upgrading Infrastructure Firmware at Endpoints](#concept_701354DD77064F419FE49E94BD38F26F), details the process that Cisco recommends for upgrading infrastructure firmware on endpoints.

You can directly upgrade the firmware on the following components:

| Infrastructure | Cisco UCS X9508 Chassis | UCS 5108 Chassis | UCS Rack Server | Cisco UCS S3260 Chassis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| * Cisco UCS Manager * Fabric Interconnects   Ensure that you upgrade Cisco UCS Manager first and then the fabric interconnects. | * I/O modules, FI-IO Module, and Intelligent Fabric Module (IFM) * X-Fabric module (XFM) * Power supply unit * Server    + Adapter   + CIMC   + BIOS   + Storage controller   + Board controller | * I/O modules * Power supply unit * Server:    + Adapter   + CIMC   + BIOS   + Storage controller   + Board controller | * Adapter * CIMC * BIOS * Storage controller * Board controller | * CMC * Chassis adapter * SAS expander * Chassis board controller * Server:    + CIMC   + BIOS   + Board controller   + Storage controller |

For the Cisco UCS S3260 chassis, you can upgrade the CMC, chassis adapter, chassis board controller, SAS expander, and local disk firmware through the chassis firmware package in the chassis profile.
Cisco UCS S3260 Server Integration with Cisco UCS Manager, Release 4.0 provides detailed information about chassis profiles and chassis firmware packages.

You can upgrade the adapter, board controller, CIMC, and BIOS firmware through the host firmware package in the service profile.
If you use a host firmware package to upgrade this firmware, you can reduce the number of times a server needs to be rebooted
during the firmware upgrade process.

| **Important** | ---   All server components must be kept at the same release level. These components are tested together for each release and a version mismatch may cause unpredictable system operation.   --- |

### Stages of a Direct Firmware Upgrade

Cisco UCS Manager
separates the direct upgrade process into two stages, ensuring that you can
push the firmware to an endpoint while the system is running without affecting
uptime on the server or other endpoints.

#### Update

During this stage,
the system copies the selected firmware version from the primary fabric
interconnect to the backup partition in the endpoint and verifies that the
firmware image is not corrupt. The update process always overwrites the
firmware in the backup slot.

The update stage
applies only to the following endpoints in a UCS 5108 chassis:

* Adapters
* CIMCs
* I/O modules

On a
Cisco UCS S3260 dense storage rack server chassis, the update stage applies only
to the following endpoints:

* Chassis
  Management Controller (CMC)
* Shared adapter
* SAS expander
* Server:

  + BIOS
  + CIMC
  + Adapter

| **Caution** | ---   Do not remove the hardware that contains the endpoint or perform any maintenance on it until the update process completes. If the hardware is removed or otherwise unavailable due to maintenance, the firmware update fails. This failure might corrupt the backup partition. You cannot update the firmware on an endpoint with a corrupted backup partition.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Activate

During this stage,
the system sets the specified image version (normally the backup version) as
the startup version and, if you do not specify
Set
Startup Version Only, immediately reboots the endpoint. When the
endpoint is rebooted, the backup partition becomes the active partition, and
the active partition becomes the backup partition. The firmware in the new
active partition becomes the startup version and the running version.

The following
endpoints only require activation because the specified firmware image already
exists on the endpoint:

* Cisco UCS Manager
* Fabric
  interconnects
* Board
  controllers on those servers that support them
* On a
  Cisco UCS S3260 dense storage rack server chassis:

  + CMC
  + Shared
    adapter
  + Board
    controllers for chassis and server
  + SAS
    expander
  + Storage
    controller
  + BIOS
  + CIMC

When the firmware is
activated, the endpoint is rebooted and the new firmware becomes the active
kernel version and system version. If the endpoint cannot boot from the startup
firmware, it defaults to the backup version and raises a fault.

| **Caution** | ---   When you configure Set Startup Version Only for an I/O module, the I/O module is rebooted when the fabric interconnect in its data path is rebooted. If you do not configure Set Startup Version Only for an I/O module, the I/O module reboots and disrupts traffic. In addition, if Cisco UCS Manager detects a protocol and firmware version mismatch between the fabric interconnect and the I/O module, Cisco UCS Manager automatically updates the I/O module with the firmware version that matches the firmware in the fabric interconnect, and then activates the firmware and reboots the I/O module again.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Outage Impacts of Direct Firmware Upgrades

When you perform a
direct firmware upgrade on an endpoint, you can disrupt traffic or cause an
outage in one or more of the endpoints in the
Cisco UCS domain.

#### Outage Impact of a Fabric Interconnect Firmware Upgrade

When you upgrade the
firmware for a fabric interconnect, you cause the following outage impacts and
disruptions:

* The fabric
  interconnect reboots.
* The
  corresponding I/O modules reboot.

#### Outage Impact of a Cisco UCS Manager Firmware Upgrade

A firmware upgrade
to
Cisco UCS Manager causes the following disruptions:

* Cisco UCS Manager GUI—All users logged in to
  Cisco UCS Manager GUI are logged out and their sessions ended.

  Any unsaved work
  in progress is lost.
* Cisco UCS Manager CLI—All users logged in through telnet are logged out and their
  sessions ended.

#### Outage Impact of an I/O Module Firmware Upgrade

When you upgrade the
firmware for an I/O module, you cause the following outage impacts and
disruptions:

* For a  non-cluster configuration with a single fabric interconnect, data traffic is disrupted when the I/O module reboots. For a cluster configuration
  with two fabric interconnects, data traffic fails over to the other I/O module and the fabric interconnect in its data path.
* If you activate
  the new firmware as the startup version only, the I/O module reboots when the
  corresponding fabric interconnect is rebooted.
* If you activate
  the new firmware as the running and startup version, the I/O module reboots
  immediately.
* An I/O module
  can take up to 10 minutes to become available after a firmware upgrade.

#### Outage Impact of a CIMC Firmware Upgrade

When you upgrade the
firmware for a CIMC in a server, you impact only the CIMC and internal
processes. You do not interrupt server traffic. This firmware upgrade causes
the following outage impacts and disruptions to the CIMC:

* Any activities
  being performed on the server through the KVM console and vMedia are
  interrupted.
* Any monitoring
  or IPMI polling is interrupted.

#### Outage Impact of an Adapter Firmware Upgrade

If you activate the
firmware for an adapter and do not configure the
Set
Startup Version Only option, you cause the following outage impacts
and disruptions:

* The server
  reboots.
* Server traffic
  is disrupted.

### Recommended Process for Directly Upgrading Infrastructure Firmware at Endpoints

### Updating the Firmware on Multiple Endpoints

You can use this
procedure to update the firmware on chassis and server endpoints. Server
endpoints that are part of the associated host firmware pack cannot be updated
by using this procedure, and will display an error. To update these server
components using this procedure, ensure that you exclude them from the assigned
host firmware pack.

| **Caution** | ---   Do not remove the hardware that contains the endpoint or perform any maintenance on it until the update process completes. If the hardware is removed or otherwise unavailable due to maintenance, the firmware update fails. This failure might corrupt the backup partition. You cannot update the firmware on an endpoint with a corrupted backup partition.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the Navigation pane, click Equipment. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the Equipment node. |
| **Step 3** | In the Work pane, click the Firmware Management tab. |
| **Step 4** | On the Installed Firmware tab, click Update Firmware.  Cisco UCS Manager GUI opens the Update Firmware dialog box and verifies the firmware versions for all endpoints in the Cisco UCS domain. This step might take a few minutes, based on the number of chassis and servers. |
| **Step 5** | In the Update Firmware dialog box, do the following:   1. From the    Filter drop-down list on the menu bar, select    ALL.  If you want    to update all endpoint firmware of a specific type, such as all adapters or    server BIOS, select that type from the drop-down list. 2. In the    Select field,    do one of the following:     * To      activate all endpoints to the same version, click the      Version radio button and select the appropriate      version from the      Set Version drop-down list.    * To      activate all endpoints to the firmware version included in a specific bundle,      click the      Bundle radio button and select the appropriate      bundle from the      Set Bundle      drop-down list      . 3. Click    OK.  If one or more endpoints    cannot be directly updated,    Cisco UCS Manager displays a notification message. After you acknowledge the    notification message,    Cisco UCS Manager updates the firmware for all other endpoints on servers that can    be directly updated.   Cisco UCS Manager copies the selected firmware image to the backup memory partition and verifies that the image is not corrupt. The image remains as the backup version until you activate it. Cisco UCS Manager begins all updates at the same time. However, some updates might complete at different times.  The update is complete when the Update Firmware dialog box displays ready in the Update Status column for all updated endpoints. |
| **Step 6** | (Optional) To monitor the progress of the update to a specific endpoint, right-click the endpoint and choose Show Navigator.  Cisco UCS Manager displays the progress in the Update Status area on the General tab. If the navigator has an FSM tab, you can also monitor the progress there. An entry in the Retry # field might not indicate that the update failed. The retry count also includes retries that occur when Cisco UCS Manager retrieves the update status. |

---

#### What to do next

Activate the firmware.

### Cisco UCS Manager Firmware

Consider the following
guidelines and best practices while activating firmware on the
Cisco UCS Manager
software:

* In a cluster configuration,
  Cisco UCS Manager
  on both fabric interconnects must run the same version.
* Cisco UCS Manager
  activation brings down management for a brief period. All virtual shell (VSH)
  connections are disconnected.
* In a cluster configuration,
  Cisco UCS Manager
  on both fabric interconnects is activated.
* A
  Cisco UCS Manager
  update does not affect server application I/O because fabric interconnects do
  not need to be reset.
* If
  Cisco UCS Manager
  is updated while the subordinate fabric interconnect is down, the subordinate
  fabric interconnect is automatically updated when it comes back up.

#### Upgrade Validation

Cisco UCS Manager
validates the upgrade or downgrade process and displays all firmware upgrade
validation failures, such as deprecated hardware, in the
Upgrade
Validation tab. If there are upgrade validation failures, the
upgrade fails, and
Cisco UCS Manager
rolls back to the earlier version. You must resolve these faults and then use
the
Force option to continue with the upgrade.

For example, because
M1 and M2 blade servers are not supported on Release 3.1(1), if you have M1 or
M2 blade servers in the configuration when upgrading from Release 2.2(x) to
Release 3.1(1), these will be reported as validation faults in the
Upgrade
Validation tab, and the upgrade will fail.

If you do not want
Cisco UCS Manager
to validate the upgrade or downgrade process, check the
Skip
Validation check box.

### IOM and IFM (IOM for Cisco UCS X-Series Servers) Firmware

Beginning with release 4.3(2a), Cisco UCS Manager supports Cisco UCS X9508 server chassis with Cisco UCS X-Series servers.
Cisco UCS X-Series servers support Intelligent Fabric Modules (IFM), which function similarly to the Input/Output Module (IOM)
in Cisco UCS B-Series servers. This guide uses the term IOM to refer both IOM and IFM.

Cisco UCS
I/O modules (IOMs) bring the unified fabric into the blade server enclosure,
thus providing multiple 10 Gigabit Ethernet connections between blade servers
and the fabric interconnect, simplifying diagnostics, cabling, and management.
IOMs extend the I/O fabric between the fabric interconnects and blade server
chassis, and enable a lossless and deterministic Fibre Channel over Ethernet
(FCoE) fabric to connect all blades and chassis together.

Because the IOM is similar to a distributed line card, it does not
perform any switching, and is managed as an extension of the fabric
interconnects. This approach removes switching from the chassis, reducing
overall infrastructure complexity, and enables
Cisco UCS
to scale to many chassis without multiplying the number of switches needed. It
allows all chassis to be managed as a single, highly available management
domain.

The IOM also manages
the chassis environment, which includes the power supply, fans, and blades,
along with the fabric interconnect. Therefore, separate chassis management
modules are not required. It fits into the back of the blade server chassis.
Each blade chassis can support up to two IOMs, thus allowing increased capacity
and redundancy.

#### Guidelines for Updating and Activating IOM Firmware

Consider the
following guidelines and best practices while updating and activating firmware
on IOMs:

* Each IOM stores two images—a running image and a backup image.
* The update operation replaces the backup image of an IOM with the new firmware version.
* The activate operation demotes the current startup image to a backup image. A new startup image is put in its place, and the
  system is configured to boot from this backup image.
* Check the Set Startup Version Only checkbox to set only the active image; a reset does not occur. This process can be used to upgrade multiple IOMs and then
  simultaneously reset them. If the fabric interconnect is updated and then activated, the fabric interconnect reboots the corresponding
  IOM and reduces the downtime.
* The IOM and fabric interconnect must be compatible with each other.
* If the software that runs on the fabric interconnect detects an IOM that runs an incompatible version, it performs an automatic
  update of the IOM to bring it to the same version as the fabric interconnect system software.

  Cisco UCS Manager raises a fault to indicate this situation. Additionally, the discovery state of IOM displays Auto updating while the automatic update is in progress.
* Cisco UCS Manager enables you to view the IOM firmware at the chassis level on the Installed Firmware tab.

#### Updating the Firmware on an IOM and IFM (IOM for Cisco UCS X-Series Servers)

| **Caution** | ---   Do not remove the hardware that contains the endpoint or perform any maintenance on it until the update process completes. If the hardware is removed or otherwise unavailable due to maintenance, the firmware update fails. This failure might corrupt the backup partition. You cannot update the firmware on an endpoint with a corrupted backup partition.   --- |
| --- | --- |

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the Navigation pane, click Equipment. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Expand Equipment > Chassis >  Chassis Number > IO Modules. |
| **Step 3** | Click the I/O module that you want to update. |
| **Step 4** | In the General tab, click Update Firmware. |
| **Step 5** | In the Update Firmware dialog box, do the following:   1. From the    Version drop-down list, select the firmware version    to update the endpoint. 2. Click    OK.   Cisco UCS Manager copies the selected firmware package to the backup memory slot, where it remains until you activate it. |
| **Step 6** | (Optional) Monitor the status of the update in the Update Status area.  The update process can take several minutes. Do not activate the firmware until the selected firmware package displays in the Backup Version field in the Firmware area of the General tab. |

---

##### What to do next

Activate the firmware.

#### Activating the Firmware on Multiple IOMs

This procedure ensures that the firmware activation for these
endpoints causes minimal disruption to data traffic. If you do not activate the
endpoints in the following order with the correct options configured, the
endpoints may reboot and cause a temporary disruption in data traffic.

| **Caution** | ---   Do not select ALL from the Filter drop-down list in the Activate Firmware dialog box to activate all endpoints simultaneously. Many firmware releases and patches have dependencies that require the endpoints to be activated in a specific order for the firmware update to succeed. This order can change depending upon the contents of the release or patch. Activating all endpoints does not guarantee that the updates occur in the required order and can disrupt communications between the endpoints, the fabric interconnects, and Cisco UCS Manager. For information about the dependencies in a specific release or patch, see the release notes provided with that release or patch.   --- |
| --- | --- |

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the Navigation pane, click Equipment. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the Equipment node. |
| **Step 3** | In the Work pane, click the Firmware Management tab. |
| **Step 4** | In the Installed Firmware tab, choose Activate Firmware.  If one or more of the selected endpoints are not configured with the required version as the backup version, that version does not display in the Set Version drop-down list. You must select the version from the Startup Version column for each individual endpoint. |
| **Step 5** | To activate the IOM firmware, do the following in the Activate Firmware dialog box:   1. From the    Filter drop-down list, choose    IO    Modules. 2. From the    Set    Version drop-down list, choose the version for the current 2.0    release. 3. Check the    Ignore Compatibility Check check box. 4. Check the    Set    Startup Version Only check box.         | **Important** | When you configure Set Startup Version Only for an I/O module, the I/O module is rebooted when the fabric interconnect in its data path is rebooted. If you do not configure Set Startup Version Only for an I/O module, the I/O module reboots and disrupts traffic. In addition, if Cisco UCS Manager detects a protocol and firmware version mismatch between the fabric interconnect and the I/O module, Cisco UCS Manager automatically updates the I/O module with the firmware version that matches the firmware in the fabric interconnect, and then activates the firmware and reboots the I/O module again. |    | --- | --- | 5. Click    Apply.  When the    Activate Status column for all IOMs displays    pending-next-boot, continue with Step 6. |
| **Step 6** | Click OK. |

#### Activating the Firmware on an IOM and IFM (IOM for Cisco UCS X-Series Servers)

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the Navigation pane, click Equipment. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Expand Equipment > Chassis >  Chassis Number > IO Modules. |
| **Step 3** | Select the IO Module node that includes the I/O module for which you want to activate the updated firmware. |
| **Step 4** | In the General tab, click Activate Firmware. |
| **Step 5** | In the Activate Firmware dialog box, do the following:   1. Select the    appropriate version from the    Version To Be Activated drop-down list.  If one or    more of the selected endpoints are not configured with the required version as    the backup version, that version does not display in the    Set Version drop-down list. You must select the    version from the    Startup Version column for each individual endpoint. 2. If you    want to set the startup version and not change the version running on the    endpoint, check the    Set Startup Version Only check box.  If you    configure    Set Startup Version Only, the activated firmware    moves to the pending-next-reboot state and the endpoint is not immediately    rebooted. The activated firmware does not become the running version of    firmware until the endpoint reboots. 3. Click    OK. |

In the    Kernel row, choose the firmware version to which you    want to upgrade from the drop-down list in the    Startup Version    column. 2. In the    System row, choose the firmware version to which you    want to upgrade from the drop-down list in the    Startup Version    column. |
| **Step 4** | Click Apply.  Cisco UCS Manager updates and activates the firmware and reboots the fabric interconnect and any I/O module in the data path to that fabric interconnect, disrupting data traffic to and from that fabric interconnect. However, assuming the Cisco UCS domain is configured to permit traffic and port failover, data traffic fails over to the other fabric interconnect, which becomes the primary. When it comes back up, this fabric interconnect is the subordinate fabric interconnect. |
| **Step 5** | Verify the high availability status of the fabric interconnect.  If the High Availability Details area for the fabric interconnect does not show the following values, contact Cisco Technical Support immediately.      | Field Name | Required Value | | --- | --- | | Ready field | Yes | | State field | Up | |

### Activating the Firmware on a Non-cluster Fabric Interconnect

For a  non-cluster configuration with a single fabric interconnect, you can minimize the disruption to data traffic when you perform a direct
firmware upgrade of the endpoints. However, you must reboot the fabric interconnect to complete the upgrade and, therefore,
cannot avoid disrupting traffic.

| **Tip** | ---   If you ever need to recover the password to the admin account that was created when you configured the fabric interconnects for the Cisco UCS domain, you must know the running kernel version and the running system version. If you do not plan to create additional accounts, Cisco recommends that you save the path to these firmware versions in a text file so that you can access them if required.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Procedure

---

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | In the Navigation pane, click Equipment. |
| **Step 2** | Click the Equipment node. |
| **Step 3** | Expand the Fabric Interconnects node and click the  non-cluster fabric interconnect. |
| **Step 4** | On the General tab, click Activate Firmware. |
| **Step 5** | In the Activate Firmware dialog box, complete the following fields:      | Name | Description | | --- | --- | | Kernel Version drop-down list | Choose the version that you want to use for the kernel. | | Force check box | If checked, Cisco UCS attempts the installation even if a previous attempt to install the selected version failed or was interrupted. | | System Version drop-down list | Choose the version you want to use for the system. | | Force check box | If checked, Cisco UCS attempts the installation even if a previous attempt to install the selected version failed or was interrupted. | | Service Pack Version drop-down list | Choose the service pack version that you want to apply.   | **Note** | A service pack can be applied only on its base maintenance release. For example, service pack 3.1(3)SP2 can be applied only on a 3.1(3) release. It cannot be applied on a 3.1(4) release. | | --- | --- |   Setting Service Pack to <not set> removes the service pack from the fabric interconnect. | |
| **Step 6** | Click OK. |

---

Cisco UCS Manager activates the firmware and reboots the fabric interconnect
and any I/O module in the data path to that fabric interconnect. For a  non-cluster fabric interconnect, this disrupts all data traffic in the Cisco UCS domain.

### Adapter Firmware

The
Cisco Unified Computing System
supports a broad set of converged network adapters (CNAs). CNAs eliminate the
need for multiple network interface cards (NICs) and host bus adapters (HBAs)
by converging LAN and SAN traffic in a single interface.

All
Cisco UCS
network adapters:

* Allow for the
  reduction of the number of required network interface cards and host bus
  adapters
* Are managed using
  Cisco UCS Manager
  software
* Can be used in a
  redundant configuration with two fabric extenders and two fabric interconnects
* Enable a
  "wire-once" architecture that allows cabling to be configured once, with
  features enabled and configured using software
* Support fibre
  channel multipathing

The Cisco Virtual Interface Card (VIC) delivers 256 virtual interfaces and supports Cisco VM-FEX technology. The Cisco VIC
provides I/O policy coherency and visibility to enable true workload mobility in virtualized environments. The Cisco VIC is
available in form factors for B-Series blade servers, and C-Series rack servers.

#### Updating the Firmware on an Adapter

| **Caution** | ---   Do not remove the hardware that contains the endpoint or perform any maintenance on it until the update process completes. If the hardware is removed or otherwise unavailable due to maintenance, the firmware update fails. This failure might corrupt the backup partition. You cannot update the firmware on an endpoint with a corrupted backup partition.   --- |
| --- | --- |

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | In the Navigation pane, click Equipment. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Expand Equipment > Chassis >  Chassis Number > Servers. |
| **Step 3** | Expand the node for the server that includes the adapter you want to update. |
| **Step 4** | Expand Adapters and select the adapter you want to upgrade. |
| **Step 5** | In the General tab, click Update Firmware. |
| **Step 6** | In the Update Firmware dialog box, do the following:   1. From the    Version drop-down list, select the firmware version    to update the endpoint. 2. Click    OK.  If one or more endpoints    cannot be directly updated,    Cisco UCS Manager displays a notification message. After you acknowledge the    notification message,    Cisco UCS Manager updates the firmware for all other endpoints on servers that can    be directly updated.   Cisco UCS Manager copies the selected firmware package to the backup memory slot, where it remains until you activate it. |
| **Step 7** | (Optional) Monitor the status of the update in the Update Status area.  The update process can take several minutes. Do not activate the firmware until the selected firmware package displays in the Backup Version field in the Firmware area of the General tab. |

You must select the    version from the    Startup Version column for each individual endpoint. 2. If you    want to set the startup version and not change the version running on the    endpoint, check the    Set Startup Version Only check box.  During a direct upgrade, you should configure    Set    Startup Version Only for an adapter. With this setting, the    activated firmware moves into the pending-next-boot state, and the server is    not immediately rebooted. The activated firmware does not become the running    version of firmware on the adapter until the server is rebooted. You cannot    configure    Set    Startup Version Only for an adapter in the host firmware package.  If a server is not associated with a service profile, the    activated firmware remains in the pending-next-boot state.    Cisco UCS Manager does not reboot the endpoints or activate the firmware until    the server is associated with a service profile. If necessary, you can manually    reboot or reset an unassociated server to activate the firmware. 3. Click    OK. |

### CIMC Firmware

Cisco Integrated
Management Controller (CIMC) is used for the management and monitoring of
servers in
Cisco UCS.
CIMC provides options such as GUI, CLI, and IPMI for management and monitoring
tasks. On the C-Series servers, CIMC runs on a separate chip. Thus, it is able
to provide services in case of any major hardware failure or system crash. CIMC
is also useful for initial configuration of the server and troubleshooting any
problems in server operation. You can update the CIMC firmware directly from
Cisco UCS Manager.

### Board Controller Firmware

Board controllers maintain various programmable logic and power controllers for all B-Series blade servers, and C-Series rack
servers. The board controller update utility enables you to make critical hardware updates.

Board controllers, introduced in Cisco UCS Manager Release 2.1(2a), allow you to make optimizations for components, such as voltage regulators, through an update to a digital
controller configuration file by using the board controller update utility. Previously, updating a voltage regulator required
changing physical components. These updates are at a hardware level, and are designed to be backward-compatible. Therefore,
having the latest version of the board controller is always preferred.

#### Guidelines for Activating Cisco UCS B-Series M5 and Higher Blade Server Board Controller Firmware

The following guidelines apply to Cisco UCS B-Series M5 and higher blade-server board controller firmware:

* You never need to downgrade the board controller firmware.
* The board controller firmware version of the blade server should be the same as or later than the installed software bundle
  version. Leaving the board controller firmware at a later version than the version that is currently running in your existing
  Cisco UCS environment does not violate the software matrix or TAC supportability.
* Board controller firmware updates are backward compatible with the firmware of other components.

#### Guidelines for Activating Cisco UCS C-Series M5 and Higher Rack Server Board Controller Firmware

The following guidelines apply to Cisco UCS C-Series M5 and higher rack-server board controller firmware:

* The board controller firmware and the CIMC firmware must be of the same package version.
* If the activation status of the board controller displays Pending Power Cycle after you upgrade the board controller, a manual power cycle is required. A fault is also generated. After the power cycle
  is complete, the fault is cleared and the board controller activation status displays Ready.

| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 5.2 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 5.2 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.
