**CVE-2024-20825**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Implicit intent hijacking vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The Galaxy Store app uses implicit intents for sensitive communication, allowing other apps to intercept these intents.
*   **Impact of exploitation**:  Local attackers can access sensitive information via these hijacked implicit intents.
*   **Attack vectors**:  A malicious application can register an intent filter that matches the implicit intent used by the Galaxy Store, thus receiving the data.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A local attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device.
