Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-20508:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient validation of HTTP requests processed by the Cisco Unified Threat Defense (UTD) Snort Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) Engine for Cisco IOS XE Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Improper input validation of HTTP requests.
*   The vulnerability is present in the Cisco UTD Snort IPS Engine when the Web Filtering feature, the Multi-Tenancy feature, or both are enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Security Policy Bypass:** If the action in case of Cisco UTD Snort IPS Engine failure is set to "fail-open" (default), successful exploitation could allow an attacker to bypass configured security policies.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** If the action in case of Cisco UTD Snort IPS Engine failure is set to "fail-close", successful exploitation could cause traffic that is configured to be inspected by Cisco UTD Snort IPS Engine to be dropped, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Snort Process Reload:** A successful exploit could trigger a reload of the Snort process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Crafted HTTP Request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request through an affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests through a vulnerable Cisco device.
*   No authentication is needed.
*   The attacker needs to know which devices are affected (running a vulnerable release of Cisco UTD Snort IPS Engine for Cisco IOS XE Software and had the Web Filtering feature, the Multi-Tenancy feature, or both enabled.)

**Affected Products:**

*   1000 Series Integrated Services Routers (ISRs)
*   4000 Series ISRs
*   Catalyst 8000V Edge Software
*   Catalyst 8200 Series Edge Platforms
*   Catalyst 8300 Series Edge Platforms
*   Catalyst 8500L Series Edge Platforms
*   Catalyst IR8300 Rugged Series Routers

**Unaffected Products:**

*   Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software
*   Cisco Catalyst 8500 Series Edge Platforms
*    Cisco Cloud Services Routers 1000V
*    Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software
*   Cisco Integrated Services Virtual Routers (ISRv)
*   Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) Software
*   Open Source Snort

**Additional Details:**

*   Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
*   There are no workarounds to mitigate the vulnerability other than upgrading to the fixed software.
*   The vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
*   The base CVSS score is 5.8 (Medium severity) with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N.
*   Cisco UTD Snort IPS Engine version 17.12.4 and later are not vulnerable
*   Cisco UTD Snort IPS Engine versions earlier than 17.12 are not vulnerable.
