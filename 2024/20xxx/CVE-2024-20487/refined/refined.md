Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-20487:

**1. Verification:**

*   The provided content directly mentions CVE-2024-20487 in the Cisco Security Advisory: [https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-multi-vulns-AF544ED5](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-multi-vulns-AF544ED5).
*   The advisory confirms that this CVE is a "Cisco ISE Stored XSS Vulnerability."

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability stems from "insufficient validation of user-supplied input" by the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE. This means the application does not properly sanitize or encode user-provided data before displaying it.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The core weakness is the lack of proper input validation, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code that is then stored and executed when other users interact with the affected page.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** A successful exploit allows the attacker to execute arbitrary script code within the context of the vulnerable web interface.
*   **Access to Sensitive Information:** The malicious script can access sensitive, browser-based information like cookies, session tokens, and other data related to the user's session within the web application.
*   **Potential Account Takeover:** By stealing cookies or session tokens, an attacker could potentially hijack a user's session, taking over their account and performing privileged actions on their behalf.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web-Based Management Interface:** The primary attack vector is the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE.
*   **Malicious Code Injection:** The attacker injects the malicious code into specific pages through user-supplied input fields, forms or similar mechanisms.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have at least a low-privileged account on the affected Cisco ISE device to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have remote network access to the affected system to inject the malicious payload through the web interface.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a base CVSS score of 4.3, which is classified as Medium severity.
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
*   **CWE:** CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'))
*   **Affected Product:** Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE)
*   **Fixed Software:** The advisory lists the specific versions that contain the fix (3.1P10, 3.2P7, 3.3P4). Version 3.4 is not vulnerable.
*   **Workarounds:** There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.

**Summary**

CVE-2024-20487 is a Stored XSS vulnerability in Cisco ISE that allows a remote, authenticated attacker with a low-privileged account to inject malicious code via the web management interface. This can lead to arbitrary script execution, access to sensitive information, and potential account compromise. There are no workarounds; the recommended course of action is to apply the provided software updates.
