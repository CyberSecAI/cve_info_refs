    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2024-20255",
      "description": "A vulnerability in the API of the Cisco Expressway Series could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a CSRF attack on an affected system.",
      "root_cause": "This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected system.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient CSRF protection in the web-based management interface API."
      ],
      "impact": "A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user. If the affected user has administrative privileges, these actions could include overwriting system configuration settings, which could prevent the system from processing calls properly and result in a denial of service (DoS) condition.",
      "attack_vector": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the API to follow a crafted link.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to persuade a user with API access to follow a malicious link. No authentication is required for the attacker. The attacker needs to craft a link that exploits the lack of CSRF protection.",
