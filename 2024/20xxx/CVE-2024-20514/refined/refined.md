Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-20514:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the web-based management interface of Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM) and Cisco Prime Infrastructure not properly validating user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the web-based management interface. The injected code is stored, and then executed when other users interact with the affected page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary script execution: A successful exploit enables the attacker to execute arbitrary script code within the context of the affected web interface.
- Sensitive information access: The attacker could gain access to sensitive browser-based information like cookies and session tokens.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack: A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability through the web-based interface.
- Malicious code injection: Attackers inject malicious scripts into a specific page of the interface, which is then stored and executed for other users.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated user: The attacker needs to have at least a low-privileged account on an affected device.
- Remote access: The attacker must have network access to the affected device's web management interface.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
- The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability.
- There are no known workarounds.
- Fixed software releases are available for EPNM and Prime Infrastructure
