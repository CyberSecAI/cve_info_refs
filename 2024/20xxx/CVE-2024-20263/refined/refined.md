    "summary": "The provided content discusses a vulnerability in Cisco Business 250 and 350 series switches related to ACL processing in stacked configurations. Specifically, the root cause is identified as incorrect processing of ACLs when the primary or backup switches in a stack experience a full reload or power cycle. This can lead to traffic being dropped or forwarded incorrectly, potentially bypassing configured ACLs.  The impact of exploitation could be an attacker bypassing the intended ACL security restrictions. The attack vector involves sending crafted traffic through an affected device. An attacker requires a remote position, with the capability of sending crafted traffic to trigger the vulnerable state. The content does not go into details of the crafting process, or of specific traffic patterns/payloads.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "Incorrect processing of Access Control Lists (ACLs) on a stacked configuration when either the primary or backup switches experience a full stack reload or power cycle.",
      "weaknesses": "Improper handling of ACLs during stacked switch reloads or power cycles. The ACL would be correctly applied on the primary devices but could be incorrectly applied to the backup devices.",
       "impact": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker could bypass configured ACLs, causing traffic to be dropped or forwarded in an unexpected manner.",
      "attack_vectors": "Sending crafted traffic through an affected device.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker requires a remote position and the ability to send crafted traffic to trigger the vulnerable state. No further details regarding specific traffic patterns or payloads.",
      "additional_details": "The content mentions that the vulnerability can leave the ACL configuration in an undefined state, requiring manual intervention to unbind and rebind the ACL to mitigate, though this is a temporary fix, and will not prevent the next power-cycle reload from activating the vulnerability."
