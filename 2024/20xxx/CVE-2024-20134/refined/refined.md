- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing bounds check in the `ril` component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local escalation of privilege. An attacker with System privilege could potentially gain higher privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** Local exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have already obtained System privilege on the device. No user interaction is required.
