Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-20373:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   The provided content directly relates to **CVE-2024-20373**. The advisory title "Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software SNMP Extended Named Access Control List Bypass Vulnerability", along with the included CVE ID, confirms its relevance.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The vulnerability stems from the fact that Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software do not properly enforce IPv4 Access Control Lists (ACLs) for SNMP.
   - Specifically, while they accept configurations that attach extended *named* IPv4 ACLs to the SNMP server settings, these extended ACLs are *not actually applied* to the SNMP listening process. This allows traffic that should be blocked by the ACL to bypass the configured restrictions. The system only supports standard ACLs and not extended ACLs, even if there's no warning message when configuring it.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Incorrect ACL Handling:** The primary weakness is the software's failure to process extended named IPv4 ACLs, even though the software allows the user to configure and associate them with the SNMP process.
   - **Lack of Warning/Enforcement:** There's also a weakness in that the system doesn't notify administrators that extended ACLs are not supported, which can mislead them to think they are properly securing the device.
   - **Configuration Persistence Issues**: When upgrading or downgrading software versions, if an extended named ACL is configured, it's silently removed from the configuration upon rebooting.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass the configured ACL restrictions.
   - This allows them to perform SNMP polling of the device, even if SNMP traffic should be denied according to the extended ACL.
   - A successful exploit allows the attacker to perform unauthorized SNMP operations.
   - **Note:** Attackers still require valid SNMPv2c community strings or SNMPv3 credentials. The vulnerability only bypasses the ACL access control list.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - The attack vector is remote and network-based.
   - An attacker would send SNMP polling requests to the device.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - The attacker must be able to reach the targeted device over the network.
   - The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the ACL bypass.
   -  The attacker must have a valid SNMP community string (for v2c) or SNMPv3 user credentials to execute SNMP operations.

**Additional details from the content that enhances the CVE Description:**

*   **Specific ACL Types:** The document clearly differentiates between standard (numbered or named) and extended (numbered or named) IPv4 ACLs, clarifying the vulnerabilityâ€™s limitations to extended ACLs.
*   **Scenarios of Vulnerability:** It outlines two specific scenarios of how the vulnerability occurs, during configuration with affected versions, and while upgrading from or downgrading to an affected version.
*   **Workaround Details:** The document specifies that the workaround involves converting extended named ACLs to standard named ACLs, as well as applying this workaround before upgrades to avoid issues after upgrading to a fixed release that prevents the use of extended named ACLs.
*   **Affected Products:** Only Cisco IOS and IOS XE software is affected.
*   **Configuration Verification**: Includes the precise steps to verify if a device is vulnerable, using specific `show` commands to identify the presence of extended named ACLs.
*   **No Public Exploitation**:  Notes that at the time of publication, there were no known public exploits.
