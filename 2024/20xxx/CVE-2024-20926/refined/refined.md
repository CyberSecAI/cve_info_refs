      "id": "CVE-2024-20926",
      "Description": "Multiple NetApp products incorporate the Oracle Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) software libraries. Certain Java SE (JDK and JRE) versions are susceptible to vulnerabilities that could be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in the ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Oracle Java SE or unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Java SE accessible data.",
      "Additional_Info": "The vulnerability exists in the Scripting component of Oracle Java SE. According to the Oracle advisory, the vulnerability can be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified Component without using Untrusted Java Web Start applications or Untrusted Java applets, such as through a web service."
    },
    "NetApp_Advisory": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability is present in the Oracle Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) software libraries.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Remote exploitation without authentication.",
        "Partial denial of service of Oracle Java SE.",
        "Unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Java SE accessible data."
      ],
      "Impact": "Successful exploitation could result in a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Oracle Java SE or unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Java SE accessible data.",
      "Attack vector": "Network",
      "Attacker capabilities": "Remote attacker, no authentication required."

       "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists in the Scripting component of Oracle Java SE.",
        "Vulnerabilities": [
            "Remote exploitation without authentication."
           ],
        "Impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may lead to unauthorized access to data or a denial of service.",
        "Attack vector": "Network",
        "Attacker capabilities": "Remote attacker, no authentication required."
    },
        "Debian_Advisory":{
            "Root cause": "The vulnerability is present in the OpenJDK Java runtime.",
