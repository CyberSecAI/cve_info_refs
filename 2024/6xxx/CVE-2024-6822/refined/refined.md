- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of CIN files, leading to a write past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: Opening a malicious CIN file or visiting a malicious page that triggers the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick the user into opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious page, and has to be able to provide a crafted CIN file. The attacker does not need any special privileges on the target machine.
