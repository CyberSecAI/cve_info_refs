The Comments â€“ wpDiscuz plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to HTML Injection in all versions up to, and including, 7.6.21. This is due to a lack of filtering of HTML tags in comments. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add HTML such as hyperlinks to comments when rich editing is disabled.
