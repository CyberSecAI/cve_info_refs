Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-6704:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**
   - The content from wordfence.com directly mentions **CVE-2024-6704** and states that the  "Comments â€“ wpDiscuz plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to HTML Injection in all versions up to, and including, 7.6.21.". The description matches the vulnerability type mentioned in the CVE. 
   - The provided files from plugins.trac.wordpress.org show code changes and release notes for version 7.6.22, including a "Fixed: Security issue, if reach editor and quick tags are disabled clean all HTML from comment content", indicating a fix for the vulnerability.

**2. Root Cause of the Vulnerability**
   - The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization and filtering of user-supplied input in comment content, specifically when rich editing is disabled.  The vulnerability allows unauthenticated users to inject arbitrary HTML code into comments, leading to potential security risks.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**
   - **HTML Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the failure to neutralize or filter HTML tags within the comment content when the rich text editor is not in use (or disabled).
   - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Although not explicitly mentioned by name as a weakness, the vulnerability facilitates a form of XSS because injected HTML can contain malicious Javascript code.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**
   - **HTML Injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML tags into the comments, modifying page appearance, potentially including phishing links, defacement, or other malicious content.
    - **XSS:** Arbitrary Javascript code within the comments would be executed in the browsers of other users, leading to potential session hijacking, cookie theft, redirect to malicious websites, or other forms of exploitation.
   - The severity is rated as "Medium" according to the CVSS score.

**5. Attack Vectors**
   - The primary attack vector is through the comment submission form. An attacker can insert malicious HTML and/or javascript into the comment content when the rich text editor is not enabled, and the plugin fails to prevent them.
   - This attack can be executed by an unauthenticated user, meaning no prior access or credentials are required to exploit the vulnerability.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**
    -  **Unauthenticated access:**  The attacker does not need to be a registered user to exploit the vulnerability, only able to submit comments to the targeted website.
    -  **No special privileges:** The vulnerability does not require any special user privileges.

**Additional Details**
  *   **Fixed Version:** The issue was patched in version 7.6.22 of the Comments - wpDiscuz plugin.

This vulnerability allows a malicious actor to control the HTML rendered to other users who visit the website.
