Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-6626:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the EleForms WordPress plugin. Specifically, several functions lack proper capability checks, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is the absence of authorization checks on functions that handle form submission data, leading to unauthorized access.
*   **Unprotected Data Access:** Unauthenticated users can directly access form submission data via the vulnerable functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Unauthenticated attackers can view all form submissions, potentially exposing sensitive user data collected through the forms.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct Access to Plugin Functions:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by directly accessing the vulnerable plugin functions through AJAX requests or by triggering the export functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** Attackers do not need to be logged into the WordPress site; they can exploit the vulnerability without any prior authentication.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress site to send the malicious requests and receive the sensitive data.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the EleForms plugin up to and including 2.9.9.9.
*   The provided code snippets show the vulnerable functions in `wp-ajax.php` and `export_csv.php` that are used to export form data to CSV and PDF. These functions are accessible without authentication via `wp_ajax_nopriv_`.

The vulnerability allows unauthenticated users to access and download submitted form data, including names, emails, messages, submission times, and user IDs. The vulnerability is a result of missing capability checks in functions for exporting/displaying submissions, which makes the data publicly available.
