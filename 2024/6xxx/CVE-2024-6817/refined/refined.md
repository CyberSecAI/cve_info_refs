- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing PSP files, leading to a write past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** User interaction is required. The target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious PSP file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious PSP file to the user or trick the user into visiting a malicious page that triggers the vulnerability when a PSP file is parsed.
