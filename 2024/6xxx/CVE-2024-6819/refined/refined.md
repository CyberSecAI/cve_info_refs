- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of PSP files, leading to a write past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: User interaction is required; the target must either visit a malicious page or open a malicious PSP file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious PSP file or induce the user to visit a malicious page hosting a malicious PSP file. The attacker does not need any special privileges on the target system.
