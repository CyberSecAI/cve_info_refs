- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a heap-based buffer within the Realtek Wi-Fi kernel module.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-adjacent attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device, and no authentication is required.
