# Restricted TLS certificate privilege escalation when in PKI mode

5.21.1

## Description

### Summary

If a `server.ca` file is present in `LXD_DIR` at LXD start up, LXD is in "PKI mode". In this mode, all clients must have certificates that have been signed by the CA.

The LXD configuration option `core.trust_ca_certificates` defaults to `false`. This means that although the client certificate has been signed by the CA, LXD will additionally add the certificate to the trust store and verify it via mTLS.

When a restricted certificate is added to the trust store in this mode, it's restrictions are not honoured, and the client has full access to LXD.

### Details

When authorization was refactored to allow for generalisation (at the time for TLS, RBAC, and OpenFGA, see [#12313](https://github.com/canonical/lxd/pull/12313)), PKI mode did not account for the `core.trust_ca_certificates` configuration option. When this option is enabled, all CA-signed client certificates are given full access to LXD. [This cherry-pick from Incus](https://github.com/canonical/lxd/pull/12513/commits/5cdc9a35b9c51e981b1e70330bde0413ccacc7fd) was added to LXD to fix the issue.

The cherry-pick fixed the immediate issue and allowed full access to LXD for CA-signed client certificates when `core.trust_ca_certificates` is enabled, but did not consider the behaviour of LXD when `core.trust_ca_certificates` is disabled.

When `core.trust_ca_certificates` is false, restrictions that are applied to a certificate should be honoured. Instead, they are being ignored due to the presence of a `server.ca` file in `LXD_DIR`.

### PoC

```
# Install/initialize LXD
$ snap install lxd --channel 5.21/stable
$ lxd init --auto
$ lxc config set core.https_address=127.0.0.1:8443

# Use easyrsa for configuring CA: https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa
$ cp -R /usr/share/easy-rsa "/tmp/pki"
$ export EASYRSA_KEY_SIZE=4096
$ cd /tmp/pki
$ ./easyrsa init-pki
$ echo "lxd" | ./easyrsa build-ca nopass
$ ./easyrsa build-client-full lxd-client nopass
$ cp pki/ca.crt /var/snap/lxd/common/lxd/server.ca
$ cp pki/issued/lxd-client.crt ~/snap/lxd/common/config/client.crt
$ cp pki/private/lxd-client.key ~/snap/lxd/common/config/client.key

# Restart daemon.
$ systemctl reload snap.lxd.daemon

# Add a restricted certificate to the trust store.
$ token="$(lxc config trust add --name ca-test --quiet --restricted)"
$ lxc remote add tls "${token}"

# Our client has a CA-signed certificate, but it is restricted, so the client should not be able to view server config.
$ lxc config get tls: core.https_address
127.0.0.1:8443

```
### Impact

I believe this vulnerability is low impact because PKI mode is:

1. Not the standard or recommended mode of operation for LXD.
2. While `core.trust_ca_certificates` defaults to false, we believe that users who enable PKI mode will generally have `core.trust_ca_certificates` enabled to allow for passwordless PKI with CRL revocation (see [#3832](https://github.com/canonical/lxd/issues/3832)). When this mode is enabled, all clients with CA-signed certificates have root access\* anyway.

\*Note: If a restricted certificate is added before `core.trust_ca_certificates` is enabled, the certificate becomes unrestricted. We believe this was the original intention of the PR, but this should be changed to disallow any unintended permission change.
