- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the Forensic Recorder service within Check Point ZoneAlarm Extreme Security. The service can be abused via a symbolic link.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the service's improper handling of symbolic links, leading to an arbitrary file overwrite vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Local attackers, who have already gained the ability to execute low-privileged code on the system can create symbolic links to overwrite arbitrary files via the vulnerable service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system to create the necessary symbolic link and exploit the vulnerability.
