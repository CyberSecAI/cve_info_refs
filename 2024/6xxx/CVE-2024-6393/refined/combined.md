## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# NextGEN Gallery < 3.59.5 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its Images settings, which could allow high privilege users such as Admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

Add/edit an image from a Gallery, put the following payload in the "Description" field and save the changes: &lt;img src=x onerror=alert(/XSS/)&gt;
The XSS will be triggered when clicking on the image when the Gallery is embed in a post with the NextGen Gallery block

### Affects Plugins
