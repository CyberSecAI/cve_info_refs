- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape image settings, specifically the "Description" field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges (e.g., Admin) can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they interact with the affected content (e.g., when clicking on an image in a gallery). This could lead to various malicious actions, including session hijacking, data theft, and defacement of the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be a high privilege user, such as an Admin, and be able to edit or add an image to a gallery. The malicious payload is injected into the "Description" field of an image. The XSS is triggered when the gallery is embedded in a post/page and a user clicks on the image.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges or similar high-level privileges within the WordPress site and the ability to modify gallery image descriptions.
