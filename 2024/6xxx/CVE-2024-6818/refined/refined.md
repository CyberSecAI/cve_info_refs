- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of PSP files in IrfanView. This leads to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists due to insufficient input validation when parsing PSP files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current IrfanView process.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious PSP file or a malicious web page that triggers the parsing of a malicious PSP file. User interaction is required, meaning the target must open the malicious file or visit the malicious page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to deliver a malicious PSP file or a malicious webpage to the victim. The victim needs to interact with the malicious content (either by opening the malicious file or visiting the malicious page).
