Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-6260

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of symbolic links within the Malwarebytes service.
*   **Weakness:** The Malwarebytes service can be tricked into deleting arbitrary files by manipulating symbolic links.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.
*  **Attack Vector:**
    * Local attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
    * The attacker creates a symbolic link to manipulate the Malwarebytes service.
*   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the local machine with low privileges.

**Summary:**

This vulnerability allows a local attacker to escalate their privileges to SYSTEM level by exploiting a flaw in how the Malwarebytes service handles symbolic links, leading to arbitrary file deletion. This can then be used to execute code in the context of SYSTEM.
