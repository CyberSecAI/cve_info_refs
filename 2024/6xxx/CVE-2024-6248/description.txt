Wyze Cam v3 Cloud Infrastructure Improper Authentication Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Wyze Cam v3 IP cameras. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the run_action_batch endpoint of the cloud infrastructure. The issue results from the use of the device's MAC address as a sole credential for authentication. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-22393.
