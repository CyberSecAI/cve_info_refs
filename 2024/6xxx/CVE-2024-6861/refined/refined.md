{
  "CVE-2024-6861": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in foreman before version 3.3. The server exposes a GraphQL API with limited access. If introspection is enabled (usually by default), it allow attackers to query a settings type without any authentication and retrieve the product settings, including the OAuth consumer_key and OAuth consumer_secret properties. These elements can be used to authenticate as foreman_api_admin and gain full control of the product's REST API.",
    "root_cause": "The GraphQL API exposes sensitive settings through introspection without requiring authentication.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure default configuration of GraphQL API.",
      "Lack of authentication checks for sensitive data exposure through the GraphQL API.",
      "Exposure of OAuth secrets through API responses."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can obtain OAuth consumer_key and OAuth consumer_secret and can then authenticate as foreman_api_admin, potentially gaining full control of the product's REST API.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Unauthenticated requests to GraphQL API",
      "GraphQL introspection query"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker does not need to be authenticated and only needs to be able to make requests to the GraphQL API with introspection enabled."
