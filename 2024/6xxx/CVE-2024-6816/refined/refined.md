Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the improper validation of user-supplied data length when parsing PSP files. Specifically, the application fails to check the size of the data before copying it into a heap-based buffer.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper input validation.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running IrfanView. This can lead to complete system compromise.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a malicious PSP file. The user must either visit a malicious page or open the malicious file to trigger the vulnerability. This indicates user interaction is required.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to create a malicious PSP file with crafted data to trigger the buffer overflow and then convince the victim to open this file.

The provided information gives more details than a typical CVE description by specifying the vulnerable file format (PSP) and the type of vulnerability (heap-based buffer overflow). It also clarifies that user interaction is needed for successful exploitation, and the impact of successful exploitation is arbitrary code execution within the current process context.
