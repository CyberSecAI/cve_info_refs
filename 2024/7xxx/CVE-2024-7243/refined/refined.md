**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists within the PSANHost executable of Panda Security Dome. By creating a junction, an attacker can abuse the service to create arbitrary files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The service is vulnerable to arbitrary file creation through the abuse of junctions, which can be used to escalate privileges.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate privileges to SYSTEM level and execute arbitrary code.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to be able to execute low-privileged code on the target system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system. They must be able to create a junction to abuse the service.
