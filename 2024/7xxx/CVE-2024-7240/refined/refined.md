- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies within the WithSecure plugin hosting service in F-Secure Total. It can be exploited through the creation of a symbolic link.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The service does not properly validate the target of symbolic links, allowing an attacker to manipulate file creation via the service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit allows a local attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, and requires the attacker to create a symbolic link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have local access to the system and be able to create symbolic links. User interaction on the part of an administrator is also required to trigger the vulnerability.
