- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from improper permissions set on a folder created by the Hydra Sdk Windows Service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect permission assignment on a folder created by the service allows for unauthorized access and modification.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to local privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the SYSTEM user.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker with low-privileged code execution capability can exploit the improperly permissioned folder to escalate their privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system to exploit this vulnerability.
