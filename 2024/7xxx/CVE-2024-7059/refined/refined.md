Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-7059:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the Web-based SDK of Genetec Security Center. It allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code, deviating from the intended limited set of functions normally available through the SDK.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The core vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary code, which means the attacker can run any commands they choose on the target system. This goes beyond the SDK's intended functions.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The SDK doesn't properly restrict access, allowing an attacker to execute code with administrative privileges if the required conditions are met.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The code execution occurs with administrative privileges on the machine hosting the Web SDK role.
- **Full System Compromise:**  The attacker can potentially gain full control over the system running the Web SDK role due to administrative privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** Since it involves the Web SDK, the attack is likely to be performed over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Enabled Web SDK Role:** The Web SDK role must be activated on the target system. It is disabled by default.
- **Valid Security Center User:** The attacker needs a valid Security Center user account that has the specific privilege to "log on using the SDK".
- **Valid Web SDK Certificate:** A valid Web SDK certificate is needed.
- **Network access:** The attacker must have network access to reach the web-based SDK.

**Summary:**
CVE-2024-7059 is a high-severity vulnerability in the Web SDK of Genetec Security Center. An attacker with the right conditions (enabled Web SDK role, valid user, valid certificate, and network access) can execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges, potentially leading to a full compromise of the system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported through Genetec's bug bounty program.
- There was no evidence of exploitation at the time of the advisory.
- The vendor provides patches for affected versions. Disabling the Web SDK role is suggested as a workaround.
- The CVSS v4.0 base score for the vulnerability is 8.9 (High).
- The vulnerability was discovered by Algosecure and Louis Moubinous.
