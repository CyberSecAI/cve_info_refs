- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the Anti Malware Service of VIPRE Advanced Security. It can be abused using a symbolic link to delete a file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The core weakness is improper handling of symbolic links within the Anti Malware Service which allows for arbitrary file deletion.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to create a symbolic link to trigger the vulnerability and must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
