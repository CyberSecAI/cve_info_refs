#### **Fixed bugs**

* Fixed an issue where SoapUI version 5.6.0 and 5.7.0 would not install or open on certain machines including Mac OS Ventura.

---

### SoapUI Open Source 5.7.0

Released 12th January 2021

The new release includes support for GraphQL APIs and offers other improvements that make API testing more convenient and powerful.

#### **GraphQL Support**

Now you can test GraphQL services. To do this, use the new **GraphQL Request** test step. To learn more, see [GraphQL Testing](/docs/graphql-testing/).

#### **Docker support**

SmartBear introduces a pre-configured [Docker image](/docs/test-automation/running-in-docker/), so now you can run SoapUI functional tests in isolated Docker containers.

#### **Built-in OpenAPI (Swagger) support**

Now, to work with [OpenAPI/Swagger definitions](/docs/rest-testing/openapi-swagger-support/), you do not need to use plugins. SoapUI supports it out-of-the-box. Additionally, we've improved integrations with SwaggerHub to make it even more convenient.

#### Overall improvements

* Support for OpenJDK 16.
* Now, SoapUI opens a response editor that matches the response content type. For example, it opens JSON editor if response has JSON content.
* We've updated a number of third-party libraries, including the following:

  + Apache Log4j library to 2.17.1.
  + Jayway jsonpath to 2.4.0.
* Now, SoapUI Open Source stores log files to the *<User Directory>/.soapuios/logs* directory. Previously, they were stored in the SoapUI installation directory, which could cause issues on Windows computers.
* A new feature by [modax](https://github.com/modax): Now, you can run SoapUI Open Source build from the Travis-CI.

#### **Fixed bugs**

* When proxy is set to *None*, usage of the `ProxySelector` class leads to the `NullPointerException`.
* The value of the Start Step property of the SOAP Mock Response could reset to the default value in some cases.
* A bug fix by [stevendjames](https://github.com/stevendjames): When you used Query/Match filter in the SOAP Mock Response test step, the `ClassCastException` could occur.
* A bug fix by [MagnoCorrea](https://github.com/MagnoCorrea): Names of the exported WSDL definitions with schema references could be too long. Now, such names are shorter and easier to work with.
* A bug fix by [stevann7](https://github.com/stevann7): REST mock services did not show details of the message when you double-click it in the Message Log panel.
* A bug fix by [modax](https://github.com/modax): In some cases, when you assigned a new endpoint to requests with the specific endpoint in the Service Endpoints panel, SoapUI did not apply it.
* A bug fix by [clynton](https://github.com/clynton): The `NullPointerException` could occur if you did not add the `runBeforeSteps` event listener to the project.
