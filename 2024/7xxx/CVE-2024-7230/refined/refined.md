- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists within the Avast Cleanup Service. By creating a symbolic link, an attacker can abuse the service to delete a file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a link following issue, where the service can be tricked to delete an arbitrary file using a symbolic link. This leads to a local privilege escalation vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM. This allows for complete control over the target machine.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system. They also need to be able to create symbolic links.
