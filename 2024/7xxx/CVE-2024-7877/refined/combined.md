## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Appointment Booking Calendar < 1.6.7.55 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its Notification settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when unfiltered\_html is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

1) Go to Appointment >> Settings >> Notification
2) Click on add new notification
4) In the message parameter, paste `<img src onerror=confirm(/XSS/) />`
5) The XSS gets triggered.
6) Save and reload to see that it is stored
