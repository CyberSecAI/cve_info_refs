Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-7877:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the plugin not properly sanitizing and escaping certain Notification settings. Specifically, the message parameter within the notification settings is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected and stored in the plugin's settings, which is then executed when a user views the affected area.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code. This could lead to:
    *   **Account compromise:** Session hijacking and cookie theft could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts.
    *   **Malicious actions:** Redirecting users to malicious sites, injecting malware, defacing the website, etc.
    *   **Data theft:** Accessing sensitive information within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Admin Panel:** The vulnerability is exploited through the plugin's settings page, specifically within the notification configuration.
*   **Settings Injection:** An attacker needs to inject malicious code into the "message" parameter when adding/editing a notification setting.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **High Privilege Access:** The attacker must have administrator or equivalent high-privilege access to the WordPress site to modify plugin settings. This is noted as "Admin+" in the description.
*   **Access to plugin settings:** The attacker must be able to navigate to the plugin's notification settings page.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions of the "Appointment Booking Calendar" plugin prior to 1.6.7.55.
*   The XSS payload `<img src onerror=confirm(/XSS/) />` is provided as proof of concept to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered even when `unfiltered_html` is disallowed, indicating a flaw in input sanitization within the plugin itself.
