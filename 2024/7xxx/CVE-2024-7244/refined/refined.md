- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the VPN process within Panda Security Dome not restricting DLL searches to trusted paths, leading to the potential loading of a malicious DLL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unrestricted DLL search path vulnerability in the VPN process.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate privileges to SYSTEM level and execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors:** A local attacker needs the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system. They can then leverage the vulnerability by placing a malicious DLL in a location where the VPN process would load it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
