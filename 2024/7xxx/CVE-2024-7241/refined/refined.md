- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies within the PSANHost service of Panda Security Dome. By creating a junction, an attacker can manipulate the service to create an arbitrary file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability is a local privilege escalation flaw caused by the ability to create arbitrary files through a junction abuse within the PSANHost service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is local. An attacker needs to have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to execute low-privileged code on the target machine.
