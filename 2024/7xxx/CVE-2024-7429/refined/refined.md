### Summary of CVE-2024-7429

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Zotpress plugin for WordPress lacked proper authorization checks in the `Zotpress_process_accounts_AJAX` function. This function handles various plugin settings modifications.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing authorization check: The `Zotpress_process_accounts_AJAX` function didn't verify if the user had the necessary permissions to perform the requested actions, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive plugin settings.
- Improper Access Control

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An authenticated attacker with Contributor-level access or higher could reset the plugin's settings by exploiting the missing authorization check. This would allow a lower-privileged user to disrupt or modify the plugin's functionality on the WordPress site.
- The attacker could add, delete, and clear the cache of accounts. Additionally, they could set default accounts and styles, set a reference widget for CPT, and reset the plugin.
- The attacker could also add or remove item images

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via AJAX requests to the `Zotpress_process_accounts_AJAX` function.
- Attackers need to be authenticated WordPress users with at least Contributor-level access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be a registered user on the WordPress site with at least Contributor-level privileges.
- The attacker needs the ability to send crafted AJAX requests.
