## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Appointment Booking Calendar < 1.6.7.55 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its Appointment Type settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when unfiltered\_html is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

1) Go to "Appointments"
2) Go to Appointment Types.
3) Click on "Create a new appointment Type"
4) Use this payload in Instructions field: `<svg><animate onbegin=prompt(/XSS/) attributeName=x dur=1s>`
5) Leave other fields. Save it
6) Now Go to Appointments >> Settings >> Notifications
7) Click on Email (Admin) and Edit which will trigger the XSS
