- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input within the "Instructions" field of the Appointment Type settings, leading to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS vulnerability due to inadequate input sanitization and output escaping in the Appointment Type settings "Instructions" field.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code, which would be executed when an administrator views the notification email settings. This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, data theft, or other attacks against the administrator.

- **Attack vectors:**
    1.  An administrator with high privileges needs to navigate to the Appointment Types settings.
    2.  The administrator creates or edits an appointment type, inserting the malicious payload `<svg><animate onbegin=prompt(/XSS/) attributeName=x dur=1s>` into the "Instructions" field.
    3.  The attacker navigates to Appointments >> Settings >> Notifications >> Email (Admin) and edits the notification which will trigger the XSS.
    
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to access and modify the Appointment Types and notification settings.
