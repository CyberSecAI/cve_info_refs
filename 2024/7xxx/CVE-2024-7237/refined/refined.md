- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A symbolic link can be created to manipulate the AVG Service into deleting a target folder.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of symbolic links by the AVG Service allows for arbitrary file deletion.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must have local access to the system and must be able to execute low-privileged code. They then create a symbolic link to exploit the service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
