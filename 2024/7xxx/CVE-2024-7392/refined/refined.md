The provided content is related to CVE-2024-7392.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the connection handling of the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) interface within the ChargePoint Home Flex charging device. Specifically, there's a limitation on the number of active connections allowed, which can be exploited to create a denial-of-service (DoS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient limitation on the number of active BLE connections, allowing an attacker to exhaust the resource.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful attack results in a denial-of-service condition, rendering the ChargePoint Home Flex charging device unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-adjacent attackers can exploit this via the Bluetooth Low Energy interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be within Bluetooth range of the ChargePoint Home Flex device.
- No authentication is required.
- The attacker must be able to initiate multiple BLE connections to exhaust the available connection slots.
