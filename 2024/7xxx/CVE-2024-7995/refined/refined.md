Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an untrusted search path being used within the Autodesk VRED Design application. This means the application may load libraries or executables from locations that are not secure, leading to potential issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Untrusted Search Path:** The core weakness is the application's reliance on untrusted search paths when loading external resources like binaries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting the untrusted search path, a malicious actor can escalate their privileges to "NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM".
- **Code Execution:** Successfully exploiting this vulnerability may result in arbitrary code execution within the context of the escalated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously Crafted Binary:** An attacker could craft a malicious binary with the same name as a resource the application loads and place it in an untrusted path. When the application attempts to load the legitimate resource, it may instead load the malicious file from the compromised location.
- **File Download:** The malicious binary could be introduced through a download initiated by an unsuspecting user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Create/Place Malicious File:** The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious binary file and place it in a location where the application's search path will find it.
- **User Interaction:** While not direct interaction, the user must, in some way, cause the application to search the compromised path where the malicious file is placed (for example by opening a file).

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability affects Autodesk VRED Design version 2025.
- A fix is available in version 2025.2 of Autodesk VRED Design.
- Autodesk recommends users only open files from trusted sources as a general security practice.
- The vulnerability was reported by Zain Syed and Khalid Alshehri.
