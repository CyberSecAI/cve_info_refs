{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not sanitize and escape some parameters when accepting event registrations.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious scripts into the event registration fields. When an administrator views the registration details, the malicious script executes in their browser session, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "An unauthenticated user registers for an event and enters a malicious payload into the first and last name fields.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the event registration form."
