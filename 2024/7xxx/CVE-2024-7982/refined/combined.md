## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Registrations for The Events Calendar < 2.12.4 - Unauthenticated Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some parameters when accepting event registrations, which could allow unauthenticated users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

Note: This requires `the-events-calendar` to be installed
1. Add an event
2. As an unauthenticated user, register for the event
3. Enter the payload `ds"><script>alert(2)</script>` for the first and last name
4. As an admin, view the registrations: https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=registrations-for-the-events-calendar
5. Click "Detailed View" and then select the registration containing the payload
6. Click "Edit Selected" and see the XSS
