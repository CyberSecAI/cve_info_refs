### Root cause of vulnerability
The If Menu plugin for WordPress lacks a capability check within the 'actions' function. This function processes settings updates based on POST data. The vulnerability specifically stems from the absence of authorization checks when updating or deleting the license key.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is the lack of proper authorization checks before allowing modifications to the plugin's license key. The `actions()` function within the `Admin.php` file, which handles plugin settings updates, does not verify if the user has the necessary permissions to modify the license key, thus allowing unauthenticated users to potentially modify the license key.

### Impact of exploitation
- **License Key Modification:** Unauthenticated attackers can modify or delete the plugin's license key. Although the impact of modifying a license key is not explicitly described, it could lead to disruption of premium features, or potentially allow attackers to replace the license with their own.

### Attack vectors
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a crafted POST request to the WordPress site, targeting the `admin_init` action, which calls the plugin's `actions()` function when the admin panel is loaded, and includes parameters to modify the license key.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be logged in or have any privileges on the WordPress site.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.
