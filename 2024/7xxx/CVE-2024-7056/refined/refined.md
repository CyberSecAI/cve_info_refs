- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WPForms plugin fails to sanitize and escape certain settings, specifically within the validation messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges (Admin+) can inject malicious scripts into the plugin settings. These scripts will then be executed in the browsers of any user who submits a form with empty required fields.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to access the WordPress admin panel with high privileges. They inject the malicious payload into the plugin's validation message settings via the admin interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrator-level privileges or similar high-level privileges. The attacker also needs access to the WordPress admin panel to modify plugin settings.
