## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WPForms < 1.9.1.6 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as Admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in the Settings > Validation > Validation Messages > Required field (/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wpforms-settings&view=validation): &lt;img src=x onerror=alert(/XSS/)&gt;
The XSS will be triggered when any user will submit a form with empty required fields.
