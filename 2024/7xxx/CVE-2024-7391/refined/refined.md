- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists within the Wi-Fi setup logic of the ChargePoint Home Flex device. During the setup process, an attacker can connect to the device via Bluetooth Low Energy and obtain Wi-Fi credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure of sensitive Wi-Fi credentials through Bluetooth Low Energy during the setup process.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can disclose Wi-Fi credentials and gain access to the device owner's Wi-Fi network.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-adjacent attackers can connect to the device over Bluetooth Low Energy.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range of the device during the setup process and requires user interaction.
