- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Brocade Fabric OS does not enforce strict host key checking when performing remote operations via SSH, which makes it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `StrictHostKeyChecking` option is disabled by default in Brocade Fabric OS versions prior to 9.2.2, allowing an attacker to present a forged SSH key.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful man-in-the-middle attack allows an attacker to hijack the remote service session. This could lead to:
    - Loading older, potentially vulnerable, versions of Brocade Fabric OS firmware, which could introduce security issues or cause features to disappear.
    - Gaining knowledge of the switch's zoning or other configuration settings.
    - Modifying switch configurations, affecting the switch's ability to communicate in the fabric.
    - Intercepting and reading support data, although this does not contain user data, passwords, or other secrets.
    - Downloading different certificates, breaking valid communication with other servers.
    - Exposure of legitimate server credentials by sending them to the impersonated server during the vulnerable operations.
- **Attack vectors:** A man-in-the-middle attacker must have already gained initial access to the customer network and set up a rogue server or compromised an existing one. The attacker then intercepts communication between the Brocade Fabric OS switch and a legitimate remote server during operations initiated by a switch administrator.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be positioned to intercept network traffic between the Brocade Fabric OS switch and remote servers. They also need to have a rogue server with a forged SSH key or have compromised an existing server.
