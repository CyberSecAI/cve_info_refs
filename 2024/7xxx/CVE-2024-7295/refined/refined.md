- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of an older, weaker encryption algorithm for local asset data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The primary weakness is the use of an outdated encryption algorithm (CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials), which can be exploited to decrypt sensitive information. This goes against best practices for data protection
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could allow a sophisticated attacker to decrypt sensitive local asset data stored within the Telerik Report Server.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attack vector involves exploiting the weak encryption algorithm in order to decrypt sensitive data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker would need to be sophisticated enough to perform the decryption of the data encrypted with the vulnerable algorithm, and have access to the encrypted data itself.
