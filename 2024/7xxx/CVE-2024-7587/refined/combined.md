## 4. MITIGATIONS

Version 10.97.3 CFR1 and later is not vulnerable to this issue. ICONICS recommends that users of its products take the following mitigation steps:

* For new systems, use the 10.97.3 CFR1 or later version of the ICONICS products.
* If planning to use GENESIS64 v10.97.3 or earlier on a new freshly installed system, do not install the included GenBroker32. Instead, download the latest GenBroker32 from ICONICS and install this version if needed.
* For systems that already have v10.97.3 or an earlier version, or MC Works64 installed, verify the permissions on the c:\ProgramData\ICONICS folder do not include "Everyone". If this folder is set to provide access to "Everyone", remove this access by performing the following steps:

1. Right click C:\ProgramData\ICONICS folder and open the Properties display
2. Open the Security tab
3. Click Advanced
4. Click Change Permissions
5. Select "Everyone" and check the "Replace all object permissions entries with inheritable permission entries from this project" checkbox
6. Click Remove

ICONICS and Mitsubishi Electric recommends users update the ICONICS Suite with the latest security patches as they become available. [ICONICS Suite security patches may be found here](https://iconics.force.com/community)(login required).
