- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies within the Anti Malware Service of VIPRE Advanced Security. It can be abused by creating a symbolic link to cause the service to delete an arbitrary file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a link following issue that can lead to arbitrary file deletion. This allows for a local privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to escalate privileges to SYSTEM level and execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to already have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system and be able to create symbolic links.
