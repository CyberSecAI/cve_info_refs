## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP ULike < 4.7.5 - Admin+ Stored XSS via Widgets

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as editors to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when unfiltered\_html is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

1. Add the WP Ulike widget
2. For the widget title, enter the payload: `" style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//`
3. Save and see the XSS triggered. The XSS will also trigger when any user will access the Widget page (/wp-admin/widgets.php) and expand the WP Like widget

### Affects Plugins
