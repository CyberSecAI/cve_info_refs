**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the improper validation of the length of user-supplied data when parsing SKP files. Specifically, the program fails to properly check the length of the data before copying it to a stack-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The lack of proper length validation allows an attacker to write data beyond the allocated buffer on the stack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: A successful exploit can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious SKP files: The attacker can create a malicious SKP file.
- Malicious web pages: The attacker can also host the malicious SKP file on a web page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious SKP file or host one on a webpage.
- User interaction is required, in which a victim would need to open the malicious file or visit the malicious page.
