- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists in the `PSANHost` executable within Panda Security Dome. By creating a junction, an attacker can manipulate the service to delete arbitrary files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability is a link following local privilege escalation issue. The service is susceptible to arbitrary file deletion through the abuse of junction creation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is local. The attacker needs to have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system and must create a junction.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker must have the ability to execute code with low privileges on the target machine.
