Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-7253:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from **incorrect permissions** set on the NoMachine installation folder, specifically `C:\ProgramData\NoMachine\nxserver` on Windows systems. These overly permissive permissions allow unprivileged users to write to this directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uncontrolled Search Path Element:** The core issue is that the `nxnode.exe` process, when loading libraries, searches in a location writable by a low-privileged user, which leads to a DLL injection vulnerability.
*   **DLL Injection:** Due to the insecure permissions, an attacker can place a malicious DLL file into the vulnerable installation directory. When the NoMachine service loads, it will load this malicious DLL, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate privileges from a low-privileged user to the `SYSTEM` level.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** With `SYSTEM` privileges, the attacker can execute arbitrary code, potentially compromising the entire system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires the attacker to have local access to the targeted Windows system and the ability to execute code with low privileges.
*   **DLL Placement:** The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL file in the insecure installation directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-Privileged Local Access:** The attacker must have gained low-privileged access to the target machine.
*   **File Write Access:** The attacker requires write access to the vulnerable `C:\ProgramData\NoMachine\nxserver` directory.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects both NoMachine v7 and v8.
*   The issue was reported by the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
*   Patches have been released in NoMachine v7.15.6 and v8.12.13.
*   The vulnerability is tracked as ZDI-24-1042.
