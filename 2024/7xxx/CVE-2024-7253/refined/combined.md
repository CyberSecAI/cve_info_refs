## NoMachine Uncontrolled Search Path Element Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

### ZDI-24-1042ZDI-CAN-24039

| CVE ID | [CVE-2024-7253](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7253) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [NoMachine](https://www.nomachine.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | NoMachine |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of NoMachine. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within nxnode.exe. The process loads a library from an unsecured location. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM. |

Perfect application in every respect... used to manage my systems remotely and I must say that it behaves impeccably. Excellent. Thank you.

John Robusti, Play Store

![](/sites/all/themes/frontend/images/home/home-stars-5.png)

I am a long time with you guys, before you were on Android. I have NoMachine on all my devices in my network. Do not stop doing this software EVER !!! You rule!

Android User, Play Store

![](/sites/all/themes/frontend/images/home/home-stars-5.png)

Thanks for the great software. This is the best I've tried and I've used about a dozen remote desktop apps in the last year or so.

AJ Phillips, nomachine.com

On a real broadband connection crossing firewalls, traveling through the net, the connection feels like I'm on a Remote Desktop on my own LAN, very fast.

John S.

![](/sites/all/themes/frontend/images/home/home-stars-5.png)

A big thanks for an amazing product that 'just works' across so many platforms!

Howard P. from Florida (NoMachine forums)

I would like to let you know I love NoMachine. I'm a home user and NoMachine is an amazing remote access technology to access my home computer from college.

Marcus A.

![](/sites/all/themes/frontend/images/home/home-stars-5.png)

Very good. It beats the hell out of other remote access products, as it's light and everything runs smoothly.

Carlos, Play Store

I stumbled across a great piece of software for remote desktop. #NoMachine, I can't believe I've not found it before. Great stuff!

@citizenkahn

![](/sites/all/themes/frontend/images/home/home-stars-5.png)

Anders Gammelgaard, Denmark

![](/sites/all/themes/frontend/images/home/home-stars-5.png)

I'm very pleased with NoMachine's robustness and responsiveness. I can now use my remote machine and actually forget that it's not directly connected to my monitor.

Larry, NoMachine forums

![](/sites/all/themes/frontend/images/home/home-stars-5.png)

This is the best in class remote desktop software. Was using your tablet version on my phone and it was fine. Now with small display support it's even better. Thank you!

Aziz Anvarov, Google Play

![](/sites/all/themes/frontend/images/home/home-stars-5.png)

I was delighted to see VirtualGL working out of box, and that you bundled H.264/AVC recently. Excellent software!

Igor Podgorski, Smooth Sailing IT

![](/sites/all/themes/frontend/images/home/home-stars-5.png)

I use NoMachine. It's the only one among those I tested that would allow me to work normally in the applications I am using, like photoshop to give a very simple example.

The latest release of NoMachine is outstanding and my goto favorite at the moment. ...NoMachine uses NX technology to provide you with encrypted security and, with regards to Linux, without the lag of trying to forward X through SSH. It's fast, pleasant to use and I think most people who try it will fall in love with it.

Matt H.

![](/sites/all/themes/frontend/images/home/home-stars-5.png)

Thanks very much, just wanted to say that..... I think the product is fantastic. I am often on unreliable connections from here in India and your tech ensures things run far smoother than Apple Remote Desktop..

Henry O.

![](/sites/all/themes/frontend/images/home/home-stars-5.png)

I started to look into remote desktop solutions but none of them were any good. Then I found this wonderful app. .....Jaw dropping app, keep up the good work fellas, this is future tech right here. Highly, highly recommended!!

We needed powerful 3D acceleration for molecular visualization. NoMachine's integration with VirtualGL was the only option that gave our users the performance they needed while simplifying IT work.

Christian P., University of Maryland

NoMachine has become central to my efforts at training students in elements of computational biology. NoMachine has made it possible to provide the Linux environment to dozens of students, over the years, using one machine. As several of the tools I use for my work are developed within the Linux environment, this is a valuable service. Support is prompt, helpful and courteous. Above all, the software is reliable.

One of my favorites was showing up to an new job with some sizable demands &, after some brief inquiry, finding they had a set of 128gb many core servers with NoMachine ready to go. Hello working from beach on ultra portables.

NX has helped our Computational Science and Geophysics teams move away from expensive local workstations. We are able to leverage and share more powerful and accessible machines inside the datacenter for HPC access, remote desktop and visualization. The multi-client support, dynamic screen and bandwidth controls are superb, yet simple to use.

We have a 6 server NX cluster. On any given day during the semester, there are approximately 150 students logged into the cluster. It is used for instruction and research, and is especially used by the faculty that teach programming, because they just point their students to the NX cluster and all the programming tools are available. The faculty love NX!

Paul H., Director, Research Support Center, Computer Science Dept, University of Virginia

![](/sites/all/themes/frontend/images/home/home-stars-5.png)

What I love is that the product is very reliable, and does not require a lot of administration. I do updates once a year in the summer, then reboot the cluster in anticipation of the coming semester. Excellent product!

Paul H., Director, Research Support Center, Computer Science Dept, University of Virginia

![](/sites/all/themes/frontend/images/home/home-stars-5.png)

You should check out NoMachine. It is BY FAR the best remote desktop solution out there for all desktop OSes. [...] It is ridiculously fast. It also features excellent clipboard, file sharing, directory mounting, device sharing. It can also utilize Kerberos for authentication and can also direct data through a per-specified proxy. We use it heavily at work and it has proven to be a life saver.

From user brotenet, on Reddit

![](/sites/all/themes/frontend/images/home/home-stars-5.png)

The other goal [....] was to determine which remote software is to be used by CHESS staff and users alike. NoMachine [...] was the clear winner. Staff scientists described the experience as if you were actually sitting in front of the station.

I use NoMachine version 8 (Linux to Windows 11 Pro). Excellent product!! Fast reliable, and has exceptional support for multiple displays. The system I connect to is dual 4K monitors stacked vertically, 3840X4320pixels. NoMachine is the only product I know that can handle this properly. Excellent product!!!
