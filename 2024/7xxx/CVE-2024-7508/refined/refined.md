Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of SKP file parsing within Trimble SketchUp Viewer. Specifically, the software fails to properly validate the length of user-supplied data before copying it into a fixed-size heap-based buffer. This lack of validation allows for a buffer overflow.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Heap-based buffer overflow: A fixed-size buffer on the heap is overflowed with user-controlled data.
    *   Insufficient input validation: The program doesn't validate the size of the input, allowing for data exceeding the allocated buffer size.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the SketchUp Viewer process. This could lead to complete system compromise if the user is running with elevated privileges.

*  **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by parsing a malicious SKP file. An attacker can deliver the malicious file through different attack vectors, such as:
    *   Luring a user to open a malicious SKP file.
    *  Embedding the malicious SKP file in a website that the user is tricked into visiting.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious SKP file to the victim.
    *  The victim needs to interact with the malicious SKP file by opening it within the SketchUp Viewer.

The provided advisory gives more details than the basic CVE description, including the specific file type affected (SKP), the location of the buffer overflow (heap), the specific validation that's missing (length of user-supplied data), and the fact that a fixed-length buffer is the target. It also specifies the affected product and version.
