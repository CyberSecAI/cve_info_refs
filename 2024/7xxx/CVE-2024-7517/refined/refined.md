- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Command injection vulnerability in Brocade Fabric OS related to the `portcfg` command.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection, which allows arbitrary command execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A local authenticated attacker can perform a privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** Crafted use of the `portcfg` command on vulnerable Brocade Fabric OS versions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be logged into the switch via SSH or serial console. The exploit is only possible on IP Extension platforms (Brocade 7810, Brocade 7840, Brocade 7850) and on Brocade X6 or X7 directors with an SX-6 Extension blade installed.
