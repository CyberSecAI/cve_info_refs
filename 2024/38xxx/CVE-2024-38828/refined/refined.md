- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Spring MVC controller methods that use `@RequestBody byte[]` as a method parameter are vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability exists due to the way Spring MVC handles `byte[]` request bodies.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful attack can lead to a denial-of-service, making the application unavailable.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable via network requests to affected Spring MVC controller endpoints.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable application and does not need any special privileges or authentication. The attacker needs to be able to send a large amount of data, as that's what is being consumed by the byte[] parameter.
