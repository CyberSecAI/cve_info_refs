    "related": true,
    "summary": "The provided content describes a use-after-free vulnerability in the `nav2_amcl` package of ROS2 when setting dynamic parameters. This vulnerability arises because the `laser_scan_filter_` is not reset before being reinitialized when dynamic parameters are changed. This leads to a situation where the filter continues to run with a freed pointer, causing a crash. The vulnerability can be triggered by setting any of 18 dynamic parameters, and the fix involves resetting the `laser_scan_filter_` before re-initialization.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of resetting the `laser_scan_filter_` before reinitializing it within the dynamic parameter callback function in `nav2_amcl`. When certain dynamic parameters are changed, the node clears existing laser-related data and recreates the subscriber and filter. However, the filter continues running with the old, now invalid, pointer, leading to a use-after-free condition.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Use-after-free vulnerability in `nav2_amcl`.",
          "Data race due to lack of synchronization between dynamic parameter setting and laser scan message processing."
      ],
      "impact": "The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a crash of the `nav2_amcl` node due to a heap-use-after-free error, leading to a denial of service. This can disrupt the navigation system on a robot depending on this package.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is setting a dynamic parameter of the `nav2_amcl` node via `ros2 param set` command. This can be done remotely if the parameter server is exposed.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the capability to set parameters on the ROS2 system, which usually means having network access to the ROS2 master or having local access to the system."
    },
    "additional_notes": "The provided content gives more details about the root cause and also the 18 parameters that can trigger the vulnerability"
