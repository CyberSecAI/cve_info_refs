- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Taggbox plugin for WordPress versions 3.3 and earlier is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions on the WordPress site while they are authenticated.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, performs unwanted actions. This typically involves luring a user into clicking a link or visiting a malicious webpage.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into unknowingly submitting a forged request. This does not require any specific authentication level or position beyond being able to get a user to interact with the crafted request.
