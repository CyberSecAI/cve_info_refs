- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute a higher-privileged action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control, specifically a missing check for authorization, authentication or nonce tokens.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user could perform actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users, leading to potential unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of data or functionalities.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attack vector involves exploiting a function where the access control is missing, which could be via an HTTP request or other means.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an unauthenticated user, meaning they don't need prior authorization or valid credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
