- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Path traversal vulnerability in functional web frameworks WebMvc.fn or WebFlux.fn when serving static resources.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input used to construct file paths, allowing an attacker to traverse the file system.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can obtain any file on the file system that is accessible to the process running the Spring application.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting malicious HTTP requests, specifically targeting the retrieval of static resources.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is mentioned as required.
