- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Event Tickets plugin versions 5.11.0.4 and below are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can craft malicious links or forms that, when clicked by an authenticated user, will execute actions on the vulnerable website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or form to execute the unwanted actions on the vulnerable website. The attacker does not need to be authenticated themselves.
