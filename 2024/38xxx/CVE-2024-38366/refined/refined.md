{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The part of trunk which verifies whether you have a real email address on signup used a rfc-822 library which executes a shell command to validate the email domain MX records validity, it works via an DNS MX lookup.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Command Injection: The rfc-822 library's `host_mx` method executes an arbitrary OS command '/usr/bin/env host -t MX #{domain}' concatenating it with the user-provided emailâ€™s domain without proper validation which makes it vulnerable to a Command Injection attack."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could execute arbitrary shell commands on the trunk server, potentially gaining access to environment variables, the CocoaPods/Specs repo, and the trunk database. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, manipulation of pod specifications, and disruption of the CocoaPods ecosystem.",
  "Attack vectors": "By providing a malicious email address during the registration process, specifically crafting the domain part to include command injection sequences, an attacker can trigger the vulnerable `host` command execution through the `rfc-822` library.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to initiate a registration process with a crafted email address. They would also need to have a controlled domain name where they could set up a malicious MX record that, when resolved, would execute arbitrary shell commands on the server."
