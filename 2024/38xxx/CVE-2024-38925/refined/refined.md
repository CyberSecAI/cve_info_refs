{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `laser_scan_filter_` was not reset before being reinitialized, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free (UAF)"
    ],
    "impact": "The `nav2_amcl` node crashes due to accessing freed memory, disrupting the localization functionality.",
    "attack_vectors": "By setting specific dynamic parameters (e.g. `z_rand`, `beam_skip_distance`, etc.) of the `nav2_amcl` node, an attacker could trigger the vulnerability.",
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to set dynamic parameters of ROS2 nodes, which can be done remotely if the system is exposed."
