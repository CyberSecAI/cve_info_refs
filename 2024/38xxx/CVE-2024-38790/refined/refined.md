- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Smartsupp WordPress plugin versions 3.6 and earlier are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to potentially force logged-in users to perform unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions. Specific impacts may vary.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into executing it through social engineering or other means.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to convince a logged-in user to click a crafted link or load a malicious webpage. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the vulnerable plugin.
