- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Authenticated users can upload specifically crafted files that cause excessive server resource consumption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability lies in the processing of uploaded files, which allows for resource exhaustion through specially crafted inputs.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  A denial-of-service (DoS) attack against the Cloud Controller can be launched by exploiting this vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors**:  The attack vector involves uploading crafted files to the Cloud Controller via the authenticated user interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Cloud Foundry platform.
