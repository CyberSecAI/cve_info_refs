- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WP Fast Total Search plugin (versions <= 1.69.234) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks sufficient CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions on the WordPress site while authenticated.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a CSRF attack, where a malicious actor crafts a request that, when triggered by a logged-in user, executes unwanted actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user (with sufficient privileges) into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious page which then submits a forged request to the vulnerable website. The attacker does not need to be authenticated, but the victim does need to be logged in.
