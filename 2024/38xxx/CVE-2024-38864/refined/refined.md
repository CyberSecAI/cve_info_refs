- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrectly assigned file system permissions in the Checkmk Windows agent installation directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is due to overly permissive permissions on the `ProgramData\checkmk\agent` directory, allowing local, unprivileged users to read sensitive data. This is a regression from an incomplete fix.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local, unprivileged users can access the agent's private key, potentially compromising the TLS connection between the agent and the Checkmk site. The CVSS score indicates that this could lead to a compromise of confidentiality and limited impact to integrity.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a local, unprivileged user on the Windows system where the Checkmk agent is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the affected Windows machine and must be a non-administrator user.
