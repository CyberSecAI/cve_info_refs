Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to higher privileged users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The core issue is the lack of proper access control mechanisms, leading to unauthorized access to privileged functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact is described as "low severity" and unlikely to be exploited. However, successful exploitation could potentially allow an unauthenticated user to perform actions they should not be allowed to, which could lead to various impacts depending on the specific function affected.  

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker only needs to be unauthenticated, meaning no prior access is needed
