## What's New

This release resolves CVE-2024-38830, CVE-2024-38831, CVE-2024-38832, CVE-2024-38833, and CVE-2024-38834. For more information on these vulnerabilities and their impact on VMware products, see [VMSA-2024-0022](https://support.broadcom.com/web/ecx/support-content-notification/-/external/content/SecurityAdvisories/0/25199). For information on what else is new, see the **What's New In This Release** section. For details about defects that have been fixed, see [KB 382256](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?articleId=382256).
**Product Support Notice**
**Remote Collectors**
Cloud proxies have been established as a long-term solution for data collection. In future releases, the introduction of new features will be exclusively limited to cloud proxies, if relevant. The announcement regarding the expiration of support for remote collectors and the prohibition of deploying new remote collectors has already been added in the 8.10 Release notes and accompanying documentation.
VMware Aria Operations 8.14 is the last release supporting remote collectors. In the 8.16 and later releases, upgrades will not be allowed if there are remote collectors in use. To upgrade to the next version or a later one, it is imperative to replace all remote collectors with cloud proxies.
Complete the following steps:

* If you are using a collector group, you must add new cloud proxies to it and remove the remote collectors.
* It is recommended that if you are not already using a collector group, create a new collector group and deploy cloud proxies into it. Reassign all adapter instances that were previously associated with remote collectors to the collector groups and remove the remote collectors.

**Deprecation of the XML Media Type from VMware Aria Operations REST APIs**
The current REST APIs in VMware Aria Operations 8.18.2 support both JSON and XML types. In the next major release, new APIs or new functionalities of existing APIs will not support the XML type and will support only JSON. It is recommended that you use JSON for data interchange. However, support for the XML type in all existing APIs will continue.
**vRealize Application Remote Collector**
vRealize Application Remote Collector is not supported from vRealize Operations 8.10 and above. Migrate all Telegraf end points to cloud proxy before upgrading to vRealize Operations 8.10 and above. For information about migrating from vRealize Application Remote Collector to cloud proxy, see [KB 83059](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/83059).
**VMware Cloud**

* The VMware Cloud on Dell EMC adapter has been deprecated from VMware Aria Ops 8.18.2. As a result, the current deployment might not work.

**Native Public Cloud**
The integrations for Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud VMware Solution, and Google Cloud Platform are no longer available natively. They will be accessible via the Marketplace.

 **Note:** If you are upgrading from VMware Aria Operations 8.14.x to 8.18.2 and you have configured the Google Cloud Platform account, Google Cloud Platform will stop collecting data after you upgrade to VMware Aria Operations 8.18.2. To workaround this issue, the Google Cloud Platform adapter must be upgraded to version 8.18.2 immediately after cluster upgrade. To avoid data loss, before you start cluster upgrade, ensure that the Google Cloud Platform 8.18 management pack is available in the Marketplace.

**What's New in This Release**
For what's new content in 8.18.2, see the [VMware Aria Operations 8.18 release notes](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/aria/aria-operations/8-18/Chunk1761269763.html).

**Metrics and Properties Modifications**
The following KB article describes all the metrics and properties that have been modified in VMware Aria Operations 8.18:
 [Metrics added in VMware Aria Operations 8.18](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?articleNumber=369263)
**Instanced Metrics**
Instanced metrics are deactivated by default after deploying or upgrading to vRealize Operations 8.2 or later, and after importing a policy from older versions. To re-activate instanced metrics in vRealize Operations 8.2 or later, see [KB 81119](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/81119).
**Basic Authentication**
Basic authentication using the REST API is deprecated and deactivated in VMware Aria Operations 8.18 fresh deployments by default. Instances that have been upgraded to VMware Aria Operations 8.18.2, will inherit the same properties before the upgrade. It is recommended that you use token-based authentication instead. If you still need to activate or deactivate basic authentication, see [KB 77271](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/77271).
**Active Directory Authentication Sources**
Logging in to VMware Aria Operations with a short name will be successful only if the user name's domain suffix matches the domain name specified in the **Base DN** option. Otherwise, the full user name with the domain suffix is required during login. For more information, see [KB 68131](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/68131)

## System Requirements

Review this section before you install or update VMware Aria Operations.
Sizing and Scaling
The CPU, memory, and disk requirements that meet the needs of a particular environment depend on the number and type of objects in your environment and data collected. This includes the number and type of adapters installed, the use of HA (High Availability) and CA (Continuous Availability), the duration of data retention, and the quantity of specific data points of interest. VMware updates [Knowledge Base article 2093783](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2093783) with the most current information about sizing and scaling. The Knowledge Base article includes overall maximums and spreadsheet calculations that provide a recommendation based on the number of objects and metrics you expect to monitor.
Deployment Formats
You can deploy VMware Aria Operations 8.18.2 with VMware virtual appliance.
If you are deploying a VMware Aria Operations virtual appliance and VMware Aria Operations Cloud Appliance (cloud proxy), use a VMware vSphere Client to connect to a VMware vCenter Server, and deploy the virtual appliance through the vCenter Server instance. The VMware Aria Operations virtual appliance and VMware Aria Operations Cloud Appliance (cloud proxy) must be deployed on hosts that are:

* ESX/ESXi 6.5 Update 1 or later and managed by VMware vCenter Server 6.5 or later.
* If you have VMware Aria Operations virtual appliance deployed on ESXi 6.0 or older hosts, you must first upgrade vCenter Server and ESXi to version 6.5 Update 1 or later, and then upgrade to VMware Aria Operations 8.18.2.

## Hardware Versions, Cipher Suites and Protocols, and Log4j

**Hardware Versions**
The minimum hardware version required for VMware Aria Operations 8.x releases is version 11. If your VMware Aria Operations virtual appliance had a hardware version earlier than 11, you must first upgrade to hardware version 11 on VMware Aria Operations virtual appliance and then upgrade to VMware Aria Operations 8.18.2.
**Cipher Suites and Protocols**
For information about cipher suite lists and relevant protocols, see [Cipher Suites and Protocols](/us/en/vmware-cis/aria/aria-operations/8-18/vrealize-operations-manager-security-guide-8-18/virtual-application-installation-ovf/cipher-suites-and-protocols.html).

## Installing and Upgrading VMware Aria Operations

**Upgrading to VMware Aria Operations 8.18.2 or upgrading any Management Pack (MP), resets out-of-the-box content as part of the software upgrade process. This implies that the user modifications made to default content such as alert definitions, symptom definitions, recommendations, policies, views, dashboards, widgets, and reports are overwritten. You need to clone or backup the content before you upgrade to VMware Aria Operations 8.18.2.**
**Notes:**

* To see the supported direct upgrade path, refer to the [Product Interoperability Matrix](https://interopmatrix.vmware.com/Upgrade?productId=1427&isHidePatch=true).
* While upgrading to VMware Aria Operations 8.18.2, the expected size of the /dev/sda for Photon OS is 20 GB (hard disk 1). For information about this requirement, see [KB 75298](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/75298).
* It is always recommended to run the Pre-Upgrade Assessment tool before an upgrade. A pre-upgrade assessment report that is generated will provide you with the recommended replacements. This tool provides you with an impact analysis following the reduction of metrics in various versions of the product. For more details on using the Pre-Upgrade Assessment Tool, see [KB 369264](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?articleNumber=369264).
* It is mandatory to create a snapshot of each node in a cluster before you update a VMware Aria Operations cluster. Once the update is complete, you must delete the snapshot to avoid performance degradation.

## Resolved Issues

For details on resolved issues, see [KB 382256](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?articleId=382256).

## Known Issues

### Installation and Upgrade Issues

#### Upgrade to VMware Aria Operations 8.18.2 will impact some management packs

When you upgrade to VMware Aria Operations 8.18.2, some management packs might not be compatible with JDK11 and would require an upgrade to a JDK11 compatible version. Contact the vendor to confirm if the management pack is compatible with VMware Aria Operations 8.18.2.
**Workaround:** See [KB 89675](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/89675) for more details.

#### Upgrade might fail if any of the nodes are running on VMs with US/Pacific-New timezone

PostgreSQL database systems no longer support the US/Pacific-New timezone, which was just an alias for America/Los\_Angeles timezone. If any of the VMware Aria Operations nodes are running on VMs with US/Pacific-New timezone, upgrade might fail.
**Workaround:** Change VM timezones from US/Pacific-New to America/Los\_Angeles, and then upgrade.

#### After upgrading vrops org (8.4 to 8.5), content upgrade is failing in Cloud and On-prem.

**After you upgrade vRealize Operations from 8.4 to a later release, content upgrade and agent management actions fail**After you upgrade from a previous release, content upgrade and agent management actions fail on on-prem and SaaS when you also upgrade cloud proxy.
**Workaround:**Complete the following steps:

- SSH to the Cloud Proxy VM.
- Run the following command: */rpm-content/ucp/subsequentboot.sh*

You can view the log from the following location: */opt/vmware/var/log/ucp-subsequentboot*

### General Issues

#### Agent Install Fails for Non-HA Collector Groups

Product managed agent install fails with an error for non-HA collector groups
**Workaround:**

* Move the cloud proxy out of the non-HA collector group so that it functions as a standalone cloud proxy, or
* Activate the collector group so that it functions as an HA collector group.

#### Installation of agents in bulk on product managed VMs, fail with an error

Installing agents in bulk on product managed VMs may fail for some VMs with the following error: "Exception occurred while trying to upload the command".
**Workaround:** Reattempt the installation of the agent on those VMs where installation failed. This often resolves the problem and the agents are installed successfully.

#### The Kubernetes management pack does not work after an upgrade to VMware Aria Operations 8.18.2

If you have the Kubernetes management pack installed and have upgraded to VMware Aria Operations 8.18.2, the management pack does not work.
**Workaround:** It is recommended that you upgrade the management pack to version 2.2.

#### The Google Cloud Platform cloud management pack fails after you upgrade from VMware Aria Operations 8.14.x to VMware Aria Operations 8.18.2

If you have configured the Google Cloud Platform management pack on VMware Aria Operations 8.14.x and have upgraded to VMware Aria Operations 8.18.2, the management pack will not work.

#### The CMA management pack has broken links in many of its dashboard widgets

The CMA management pack is no longer updated and will be removed in future releases. It is currently available, but not fully functional, and in a deactivated state. You can activate the management pack if required, but most functionality is incomplete.**Workaround:** None

#### VMware Chargeback migration must be run with an "admin" user

  While migrating from VMware Chargeback to VMware Aria Operations, you must run the migration with an "admin" user.
**Workaround:** None

#### VC Pricing Policies migration must be run with an "admin" user

 While migrating from VC Pricing card to VMware Aria Operations policies, you must run the migration with an "admin" user.
**Workaround:** None

#### Side-details panel for the collector group fails to load if many cloud proxies are configured

**The side-details panel for the collector group fails to load if more than 90 cloud proxies are configured.**
**Workaround:** Configure less than 90 cloud proxies.

#### vSAN Oversubscription Capacity and Oversubscription Ratio metrics are incorrect

Oversubscription Capacity and Oversubscription Ratio metrics calculation is incorrect for the vSAN ESA environment. The Oversubscription metrics are applicable only for the vSAN OSA clusters.
**Workaround:** None

#### Agent install fails with the error: Connect to salt master

When you install an agent to monitor applications using Telegraf, the following error may occur: Connect to Salt Master. The error occurs because the end point VM is unable to connect with the salt master.
**Workaround:** Verify the ownership of the folders in */ucp/salt/pki/master* in cloud proxy. The ownership must be admin/admin. If the ownership is not admin, reset permissions/ownership.

- Run the /ucp/ucp-config-scripts/ucp-firstboot.sh script and verify the permissions of the folder.
- Reinstall the agent after successful execution of the script.

Agent install should be successful.

#### VMware Aria Operations API (Suite-API) based Telegraf agent installation fails with an error

When you use an API end point for Telegraf agent installation in VMware Aria Operations API (Suite-API) using /api/applications/agents, the following error occurs:
```
VM with ID - id is not connected to any ARC or Cloud Proxy
Ex- VM with ID - 94b8e2eb-37fa-4a44-b241-b50e3a013bf7 is not connected to any ARC or Cloud Proxy
```

**Workaround:**

- Move the vCenter adapter collector/group back to the same cloud proxy/collector group that was selected the during the first Telegraf agent installation of VMs for that vCenter.
- Navigate to **Data Sources > Integrations > Accounts > vCenter** and select the vCenter where the endpoint is located.
- Click **Edit** and under the Cloud Account Information, select the **vCenter** tab **> Collector/Group** and change collector/collector group from drop down options and then click **Save**.
- After the Telegraf agent installation is successful, move the vCenter adapter collector/group back to the initial cloud proxy/collector group.

#### JBoss server running in domain mode does not support LCM using custom Telegraf

You cannot deploy jolokia.war across all the servers that run as a part of the JBoss domain mode and hence metrics cannot be collected.
**Workaround:** Monitoring domain mode configuration in JBoss is supported in open source Telegraf. You can deploy jolokia.war across multiple servers.

#### The Add button in the Manage Telegraf Agents page remains activated after the creation of an application service

While monitoring specific application services using Telegraf, the Add button in the Manage Telegraf Agents page is active after the creation of the second instance of the following application services: MSIIS, Active Directory, SharePoint, MSExchange, and Network Time Protocol.
**Workaround:** Delete the previous configurations of the specific application services and configure a new one.

#### Concurrent activation or deactivation of plugins during application monitoring using suite-api does not work

During application monitoring using suite-api, when you activate or deactivate plugins concurrently, plugin activation or deactivation does not work. An exception is logged in the ucpapi.log file.
**Workaround:** Provide a gap of one second between each thread during activation or deactivation of the plugins using suite-api.

#### When you get an application instance's configuration status using a Rest-API call, a wrong status is returned when the same configuration was installed or uninstalled previously

If you installed or uninstalled an application instance and then uninstalled or installed it respectively, the API returns "SUBMITTING" when you try to get the application instance install or uninstall configuration status using "GET /api/applications/agents/services/{taskId}/status".
**Workaround:** While getting the application instance configuration status using the "GET /api/applications/agents/services/{taskId}/status" API, ensure that you use the latest performed task ID. The result of calls with older IDs is undefined.

#### When you upgrade from vRealize Operations 8.1 to VMware Aria Operations 8.18.2, the Cassandra application service is displayed as Java Application in the Services Discovered/Configured column of the Manage Telegraf Agents tab

During application monitoring, after you upgrade from vRealize Operations 8.1 to VMware Aria Operations 8.18.2, the Cassandra application service is displayed as Java Application in the Services Discovered/Configured column of the Manage Telegraf Agents tab. This happens if the Cassandra application service is configured for monitoring in vRealize Operations 8.1, using the vRealize Application Remote Collector generic Java plugin.
**Workaround:** Deactivate the Java plugin before you upgrade the vRealize Application Remote Collector agent on the VM. After upgrading the vRealize Application Remote Collector agent, the Cassandra plugin will be discovered and can then be activated.

#### System language settings affects service discovery

Service discovery might not work if the system language is different from English. For languages different from English, network connection state values might be different from constants defined in standard RFCs.
**Workaround:** None

#### Reconfigure the Project Price widget if the VMware Aria Automation integration is deactivated and then reactivated

There is data missing in the **Project Price** widget of the **Cloud Automation Project Price Overview** dashboard when you deactivate and then reactivate an existing VMware Aria Automation integration.
**Workaround:** Reconfigure the **Project Price** widget by completing the following steps:

- After you deactivate and then reactivate the VMware Aria Automation integration, navigate to **Dashboards** > **VMware Aria Automation** > **Cloud Automation Project Price Overview** dashboard.
- Edit the **Project Price** widget.
- Navigate to the **Input data** section.
- Select the **'+' (Add Object)** button and select the CAS World object from **VMware Aria Automation > CAS World**.
- Click **OK**.
- Navigate to the **Output data** in the same widget configuration mode. Search for and select the CAS Project Price View object from the list.
- Save the widget.

#### While monitoring applications, you cannot activate a plugin with the same fields till the plugin configuration is deleted

An error message is displayed in the user interface of VMware Aria Operations that states the following: 'Failed to update resource: Resource with same key already exists'.
**Workaround:** Manually delete the existing plugin configuration and then continue with the activation of the plugin. If the problem persists, delete the corresponding resource from the inventory.

#### Alerts from the vSAN adapter that correspond to vSAN health check tests are not canceled if the test is removed from the vSAN Health Service.

VMware Aria Operations cannot detect and cancel deleted alerts.
**Workaround**: Manually cancel the alert from the user interface of VMware Aria Operations.

#### Despite deleting ucp-adapter instance certificates, users can run actions

If users delete ucp-adapter instance certificates, they can still run actions such as, start and stop an agent, configure remote checks, and so on.
**Workaround:** None

#### The compliance score for a user with limited object visibility is the same as for a user with complete object visibility

The compliance score is calculated for objects that are not visible (not assigned) to the current user.
**Workaround:** Complete the following steps:

- Create a custom group with objects visible (assigned) to the user.
- For that group, apply a policy in which the needed set of compliance alert definitions is activated.If that set is activated only in one active policy (the one that is applied to the custom group), the compliance benchmark based on those alert definitions will display the correct score.

### User Interface Issues

#### After upgrading cloud proxy and VMware Aria Operations to 8.18.2, the VM name is not appended to the MSSQL instance

After upgrading cloud proxy and VMware Aria Operations to 8.18.2, the VM name is not appended to the MSSQL instance for existing or newly activated plugins.
**Workaround**: None

#### The Last Year option in the date picker is not intuitive

The Last Year option in the date picker indicates that the time range starts from the end of the previous month and goes back a year. It does not indicate a time range that spans one year from the current date or the whole previous year.
**Workaround**: None
