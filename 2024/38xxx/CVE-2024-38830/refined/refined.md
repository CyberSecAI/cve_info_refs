*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Improper access control or vulnerability in the software.
*   **Impact:**  A malicious actor with local administrative privileges can escalate their privileges to the root user on the appliance.
*  **Attack Vector:** Local access to the VMware Aria Operations appliance.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Local administrative privileges on the VMware Aria Operations appliance.

**CVE-2024-38831: Local privilege escalation vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** A local privilege escalation vulnerability exists in VMware Aria Operations.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Ability to insert malicious commands into the properties file of the software.
*   **Impact:** A malicious actor with local administrative privileges can insert malicious commands into the properties file to escalate privileges to a root user on the appliance.
*   **Attack Vector:** Local access to the VMware Aria Operations appliance.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Local administrative privileges on the VMware Aria Operations appliance.

**CVE-2024-38832: Stored cross-site scripting vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** A stored cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in VMware Aria Operations.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Improper sanitization of user input when creating or editing views.
*   **Impact:** A malicious actor with editing access to views may be able to inject malicious script, leading to stored cross-site scripting.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network-based; exploiting a vulnerability through the user interface.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Editing access to views within VMware Aria Operations.

**CVE-2024-38833: Stored cross-site scripting vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:**  A stored cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in VMware Aria Operations.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper sanitization of user input when creating or editing email templates.
*   **Impact:** A malicious actor with editing access to email templates might inject malicious script, leading to stored cross-site scripting.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network-based; exploiting a vulnerability through the user interface.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Editing access to email templates within VMware Aria Operations.

**CVE-2024-38834: Stored cross-site scripting vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:**  A stored cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in VMware Aria Operations.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper sanitization of user input when creating or editing cloud provider settings.
*  **Impact:** A malicious actor with editing access to cloud provider settings might be able to inject malicious script, leading to stored cross-site scripting.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network-based; exploiting a vulnerability through the user interface.

**Summary of all CVEs:**

*   **Vulnerabilities:** The identified vulnerabilities include two local privilege escalation issues (CVE-2024-38830, CVE-2024-38831) and three stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issues (CVE-2024-38832, CVE-2024-38833, CVE-2024-38834).
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to privilege escalation to root and arbitrary code execution within the context of the application through XSS.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Privilege escalation requires local access to the VMware Aria Operations appliance. XSS vulnerabilities are network-based, achieved through injection of malicious scripts via the user interface.
*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerabilities are addressed in VMware Aria Operations version 8.18.2. Users of affected versions should upgrade to this version. There are no workarounds provided.
