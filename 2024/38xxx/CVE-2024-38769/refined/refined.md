- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function, leading to broken access control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken access control vulnerability. Specifically, missing authorization checks that would prevent unprivileged users from executing higher-privileged actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users. The specific impact varies depending on the function vulnerable to the access control issue.
- **Attack vectors**: Unauthenticated users can exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
