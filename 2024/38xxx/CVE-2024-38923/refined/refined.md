```yaml
CVE: CVE-2024-38923
Root cause: A use-after-free vulnerability occurs in `nav2_amcl` when dynamic parameters are set. The callback function for laser scan messages continues to execute while dynamic parameters are being changed. When certain parameters are changed, the laser scan subscription and associated resources are reset/cleared, but the message filter callback is not, leading to a use-after-free when the callback attempts to access the freed memory.
Weaknesses:
  - Use-after-free
  - Race condition between parameter updates and message processing
Impact of exploitation:
  - Crash of the `nav2_amcl` node, causing denial of service
Attack vectors:
  - Setting dynamic parameters of the `nav2_amcl` node via `ros2 param set`
Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - Ability to send `ros2` commands to set dynamic parameters of the affected node.
