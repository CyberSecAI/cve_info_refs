- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Animated Rotating Words plugin versions 5.6 and below are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions on the WordPress site while authenticated.
- **Attack vectors:** This is a CSRF vulnerability, meaning that an attacker would need to trick an authenticated user into making a request they didn't intend to make.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into sending it to the vulnerable site. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
