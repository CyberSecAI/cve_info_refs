{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `laser_scan_filter_` was not being reset before being reinitialized when dynamic parameters were changed, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
       "Race condition due to missing synchronization"
    ],
    "impact": "A heap-use-after-free error occurs, causing the `nav2_amcl` node to crash and stop working.",
    "attack_vectors": "By setting specific dynamic parameters via `ros2 param set`",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to set ROS2 parameters for the `nav2_amcl` node."
  },
  "additional_information": {
    "details": "The issue stems from a missing `laser_scan_filter_.reset()` call before `initMessageFilters()` in the `nav2_amcl` node. The `laser_scan_filter_` continues to run even after `scan_sub_.reset()`, leading to accessing freed memory. This was observed when parameters such as `z_rand`, `beam_skip_distance`, etc. were changed. The fix involves explicitly resetting `laser_scan_filter_` before reinitializing it."
