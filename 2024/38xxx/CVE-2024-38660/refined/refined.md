Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2024-38660:

**Root Cause:**

*   Protection mechanism failure in the Sub-Page write Permissions (SPP) for some Intel速 Xeon速 processor family (E-Core).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   A flaw exists in the SPP implementation, specifically within some Intel Xeon processors (E-Core). This failure in protection mechanisms allows an authenticated user to potentially escalate privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Escalation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow a local authenticated user to gain higher-level access than intended.
*   Specifically, the CVSS v3.1 score indicates a potential for **low** impact on confidentiality, **low** impact on integrity, and **no** impact on availability. However, the scope is changed. The CVSS v4 score indicates **no** impact on confidentiality, **low** impact on integrity, and **no** impact on availability, with no scope change.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable through local access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the target system.
*   **Physical Presence:** The attacker must have local access to the system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Intel速 Xeon速 6 processor family (Sierra Forest).
*   Intel has released guidance for Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM, hypervisor) software in virtualized environments.
*   The advisory states that there is no action required in non-virtualized environments or where SPP is not used.
