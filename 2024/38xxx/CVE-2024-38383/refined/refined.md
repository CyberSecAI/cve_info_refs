Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an uncontrolled search path in some Intel® Quartus® Prime Pro Edition software for Windows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Uncontrolled Search Path:** The software doesn't properly restrict the locations it searches for required files or resources. This allows an attacker to potentially introduce malicious files into the search path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Escalation of Privilege:** By placing malicious files in a location where the software searches, an attacker can potentially cause the software to execute their code with elevated privileges, allowing them to gain greater control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed.
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system.
- **User Interaction:** The vulnerability requires user interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a valid user account on the target system.
- The attacker needs to be able to write files to locations which are part of the uncontrolled search path.
- The attacker needs to trick the user into running the vulnerable software in a way that it searches for the malicious files and executes them.
