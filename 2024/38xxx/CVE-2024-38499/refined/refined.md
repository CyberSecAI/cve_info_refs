{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper privilege management in Broadcom CA Client Automation (DSM) allows low-privileged Windows users to extract cryptographic keys.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The software stores encrypted configuration data locally, which can contain sensitive information such as service account credentials. The cryptographic keys used for encryption can be extracted by low-privileged users due to a design flaw in the Common Application Framework (CAF) command-line tool.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can extract cryptographic keys and decrypt sensitive configuration data, potentially leading to privilege escalation attacks and unauthorized access to other systems on the corporate network. This could lead to a compromise of the local system and potentially other systems if the compromised credentials grant access.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is carried out by exploiting the CAF command-line tool via a proof-of-concept tool to extract cryptographic keys from a managed client system.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a low-privileged Windows user or have malware running in the context of a low-privileged user on a system managed by Broadcom CA DSM. The attacker must be able to execute the provided proof-of-concept tool, or replicate it, on the target system."
