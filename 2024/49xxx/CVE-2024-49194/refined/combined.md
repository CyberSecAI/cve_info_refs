# Problem

A vulnerability in the Databricks JDBC Driver could potentially allow remote code execution (RCE) by triggering a JNDI injection via a JDBC URL parameter. This issue was reported via the Databricks bug bounty program and was assigned [CVE-2024-49194](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-49194). It is rated with a severity impact of high and is patched in Databricks JDBC Driver version 2.6.40 and above.

| CVE ID | Affected Product Versions | Fixed Product Versions | CVSSv3.1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2024-49194 | 2.6.38 and below | 2.6.40 and above | 7.3 |

# Cause

The vulnerability is rooted in the improper handling of the `krbJAASFile` parameter. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to gain RCE in the context of the driver by tricking the victim to use a specially crafted connection URL using the property `krbJAASFile`.

# Solution

All current versions of Databricks Runtime on Databricks compute and serverless compute have already been patched and/or mitigated. Databricks recommends that you restart any long running clusters to ensure you are using the latest version of your selected runtime.

If you are running an impacted version of the JDBC driver on your local machine, you can mitigate the vulnerability by updating the driver. If you cannot update your JDBC driver, you should update your JVM configuration.

## Update JDBC driver

The [Databricks JDBC Driver version 2.6.40 and above](https://www.databricks.com/spark/jdbc-drivers-download) fully resolves the issue.

Databricks recommends you download and install the updated driver immediately.

## Update JVM configuration

If you cannot update your JDBC Driver you can update two values in your JVM configuration to prevent arbitrary deserialization, via JNDI, which mitigates this vulnerability.

Ensure the following configuration values are set to false:

* `com.sun.jndi.ldap.object.trustURLCodebase`
* `com.sun.jndi.ldap.object.trustSerialData`
