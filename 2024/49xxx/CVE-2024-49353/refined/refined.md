- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Failure to properly check inputs to resources that are used concurrently, leading to a race condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Race condition due to inadequate input validation in concurrent resource access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unexpected states, potentially leading to a crash.
- **Attack vectors:** Not explicitly stated, but implied to be related to concurrent usage of the affected resources.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No specific attacker capabilities or position are mentioned, but the vulnerability is exploitable if an attacker can trigger the race condition through concurrent access to resources.
