{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability occurs when a function definition in a font program contains an instruction with arbitrarily large data. Specifically, the `NPUSHW` instruction pushes a number of words onto the interpreter stack, and when this number exceeds the size of the function definition buffer, it leads to an out-of-bounds read.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read arbitrary memory of the process, which could lead to disclosure of sensitive information and aid further exploitation and exploit mitigation bypass.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to trick the user into opening a specially crafted PDF document containing the malicious font file with a crafted function definition.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a malicious PDF document. No special position or privileges are required."
