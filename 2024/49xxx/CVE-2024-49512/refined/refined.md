- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds read, which can occur when the software attempts to access memory outside of the allocated buffer. This is classified as CWE-125.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a memory leak, where sensitive information can be exposed.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring a user to open a crafted file with InDesign. 
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user to open a specially crafted file. User interaction (UI) is required. The attacker does not require any special privileges (PR:N).
