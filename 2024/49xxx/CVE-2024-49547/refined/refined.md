- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read, which can lead to a memory leak.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to a memory leak, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L), requiring low complexity (AC:L), no privileges (PR:N) and user interaction (UI:R).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access and the user must interact with a specially crafted file (likely a document) to trigger the vulnerability.
