Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2024-49777.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a missing boundary check on `slice_size` which is read from user-controlled data, in the function `MatroskaDemuxer::matroska_parse_block()`. Specifically, the `extractData` method is called with `slice_size` without any prior validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap buffer overflow read

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The heap buffer overflow can lead to a crash.
- Potentially arbitrary code execution might be possible by manipulating heap memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when parsing a malicious Matroska file.
- The attacker controls the `slice_size` value inside the Matroska file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a crafted Matroska file that triggers the vulnerability.
- No special privileges are required.
