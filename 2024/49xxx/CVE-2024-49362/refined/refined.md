{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient sanitization of `<a>` tag attributes introduced by the `Mermaid` library when rendering markdown content, which allows the execution of untrusted HTML content within the Electron window.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper sanitization of `<a>` tag attributes generated by Mermaid.",
    "Lack of sandbox attribute in the markdown preview iframe.",
    "The Electron window opens with `nodeIntegration` set to `true` and `contextIsolation` set to `false`."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine using Node.js APIs.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious markdown file containing a Mermaid diagram with a crafted `<a>` tag is opened in the Joplin application. The user clicks on the crafted link.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious markdown file to the victim, and a malicious HTML file needs to be present on the victim's local filesystem. The user must then open the malicious markdown file within the Joplin application and click on the malicious link."
