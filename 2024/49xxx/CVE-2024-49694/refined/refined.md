- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the plugin. This lack of proper access control allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated user can perform actions that should be restricted to privileged users. The specific impact will vary based on the actions that are exposed due to the missing access control checks.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a request to the vulnerable function without proper authorization.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable WordPress site and send crafted requests to the vulnerable plugin functions. No prior authentication is required.
