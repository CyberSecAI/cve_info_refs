- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference ('XXE')
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application improperly handles XML External Entity references, allowing an attacker to potentially include external malicious entities.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation requires a user to open a specially crafted document.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to create a malicious document that exploits the XXE vulnerability and trick a user into opening it with the vulnerable application.
