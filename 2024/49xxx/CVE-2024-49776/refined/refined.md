Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2024-49776.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a missing size check in the `memcpy` function calls within the `TSDemuxer::getTrackList()` function. Specifically, the size parameter is calculated by subtracting `tsPacket->getHeaderSize()` from `TS_FRAME_SIZE` without ensuring that `tsPacket->getHeaderSize()` is not greater than `TS_FRAME_SIZE`, leading to a negative size parameter being passed to memcpy.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Negative-size-param vulnerability in `memcpy`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The program crashes due to the negative size parameter in `memcpy`, which is detected by AddressSanitizer.

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing a crafted Transport Stream (TS) file (`vuln20.ts`) where the header size of the TS packet is larger than the TS frame size will trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious TS file to the vulnerable application.
