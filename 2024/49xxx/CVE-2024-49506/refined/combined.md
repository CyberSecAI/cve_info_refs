| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1228861#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2024-08-05 09:49:06 UTC  ``` While reviewing newly added systemd services I stumbled over aeon-check which runs a script containing the following lines:  ```         keyfile=/tmp/aeon-check-keyfile         dd bs=512 count=4 if=/dev/urandom of=${keyfile} iflag=fullblock         chmod 400 ${keyfile}          # Should be slot 2, but better to check and be sure         tpm2slot=$(systemd-cryptenroll ${rootdev} | grep tpm2 | xargs | cut -d ' ' -f1)          # Writing keyfile to slot 31 (end of the LUKS2 space) to avoid clashes with any customisation/extra keys         cryptsetup luksAddKey --token-only --batch-mode --new-key-slot=31 ${rootdev} ${keyfile} ```  Using this fixed /tmp file risks symlinks attacks or attacks involving preparing pre-existing files at this location.  The symlink attack would allow a local DoS, by triggering the `chmod 400` and file overwrite on arbitrary file paths.  A local unprivileged attacker could pre-create this file. Even after the `chmod`, the attacker will still be owner of the file and can thus read or overwrite its content. Therefore the keyfile used would be compromised.  Both attacks are currently not possible on Tumbleweed due to the protected_symlinks and protected_regular sysctl settings. This should still be fixed quickly, since it is a sensitive are (LUKS encryption) and a bad example that could spread in other areas.  Please use `mktemp` for safely creating temporary files. Since the file contains a private key (even if only used temporarily), it might be an even better idea to place it on a tmpfs like the XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, if available. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1228861#c8)  OBSbugzilla Bot   2024-11-04 10:15:02 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1228861) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/1220515> Factory / aeon-check <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/1220516> Factory / tik ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1228861#c10)  Johannes Segitz   2024-11-06 12:14:30 UTC  ``` Please use CVE-2024-49506 ``` |  |
