  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The software is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). This allows an attacker to make requests to internal or external resources from the vulnerable server.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is network-based (AV:N), requires low attack complexity (AC:L), and can be exploited by an attacker with low privileges (PR:L) without requiring user interaction (UI:N).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be authenticated and have at least low-level privileges. It's not specified if this is a regular user or a user with elevated privileges."
