Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE-2024-49704**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing configuration and mapping files in the Generic Data Mapper, Engineering Adapter, and Engineering Interface components of Siemens COMOS.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** XXE Injection. The software does not properly restrict XML external entity references, allowing for the inclusion of external content during XML parsing.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can extract arbitrary files with known locations from the user's system or accessible network folders.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker persuades a user to use a maliciously crafted configuration or mapping file in one of the affected components.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to create a malicious configuration or mapping file.
    *   The attacker needs to convince a user to use this malicious file within the COMOS application.
*   **Additional Details:** The advisory notes that simply setting the "read-only" property on the files is insufficient as a security measure.
