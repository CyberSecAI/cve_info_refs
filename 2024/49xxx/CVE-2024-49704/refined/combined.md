WORKAROUNDS

AND
MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:

* CVE-2024-49704: Do not use untrusted configuration and mapping files. Ensure that only authorized users can modify the files by implementing appropriate security settings. Simply setting the "read-only" property is not a sufficient security measure.
* CVE-2024-54005: Make sure that only administrators have write-access to the configuration files, especially the network configuration. Simply setting the "read-only" property is not a sufficient security measure.

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section
[Affected Products and Solution](#affected-products-section).

Please follow the [General Security Recommendations](#general-recommendations).

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

COMOS is a unified data platform for collaborative plant design, operation and management that supports collecting, processing, saving, and distributing of information throughout the entire plant lifecycle.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2024-49704

The Generic Data Mapper, the Engineering Adapter, and the Engineering Interface improperly handle XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing configuration and mapping files. This could allow an attacker to extract any file with a known location on the user's system or accessible network folders by persuading a user to use a maliciously crafted configuration or mapping file in one of the affected components.

| CWE | CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference |

Vulnerability CVE-2024-54005

The PDMS/E3D Engineering Interface improperly handles XML External Entity (XXE) entries when communicating with an external application. This could allow an attacker to extract any file with a known location on the user's system or accessible network folders by injecting malicious data into the communication channel between the two systems.
