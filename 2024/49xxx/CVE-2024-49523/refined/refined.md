Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2024-49523:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). This means that malicious scripts can be injected into the application and stored persistently, then executed when other users interact with the affected functionality.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the victim's browser. This can allow the attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information. The attacker can also modify page content, redirect the user to malicious sites, and potentially take control of the user's account.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a field or input of the AEM application that is stored persistently.
- When a victim user views or interacts with the stored data, the malicious script executes in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have at least low privileged access to AEM to inject the malicious code.
- The attacker needs to be able to cause a user to view the injected script for exploitation. This will typically involve a victim user accessing a part of the application where the attacker's malicious script is stored.

**Additional Details:**

- The CVSS score is 5.4, with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
- The vulnerability is rated as "Important" in severity.
- The affected product is Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), specifically AEM Cloud Service and versions 6.5.20 and earlier.
