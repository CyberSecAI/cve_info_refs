- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `FileServerService.prototype.proxyHandler` in Misskey did not check if incoming requests were originating from another proxy server, allowing for proxy loops.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Uncontrolled recursion and asymmetric resource consumption (amplification), specifically a lack of detection of proxy loops leading to a self-propagating reflected/amplified distributed denial-of-service. The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-405 (Resource Exhaustion) and CWE-674 (Uncontrolled Recursion).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause excessive CPU and memory usage, leading to performance degradation. A well-orchestrated attack could result in widespread outages across multiple instances due to the amplification effect.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a nested proxy request to the server that redirects back to another nested proxy request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be remote (network-based attack) and requires minimal privileges. However, some user interaction (likely clicking on a maliciously crafted link/note) is required to trigger the exploit, according to the CVSS metrics provided.
