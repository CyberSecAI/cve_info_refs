- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a result of an out-of-bounds read, which occurs when the software attempts to access memory outside of the allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a memory leak.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requires no special privileges, user interaction is required and the security scope is unchanged.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file.
