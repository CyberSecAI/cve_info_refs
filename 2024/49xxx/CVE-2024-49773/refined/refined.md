{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Poor input validation in the export functionality.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL injection vulnerability due to improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command. User-controlled input in the `current_post` parameter of the `export` entry point is used to construct an SQL query without sufficient sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Information disclosure, including Personally Identifiable Information (PII). An attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the database.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network-based attack via the `export` entry point of the application.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Authenticated user with low privileges can perform SQL injection. No user interaction is required."
