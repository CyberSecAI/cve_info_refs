- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of user-controllable input when parsing files, specifically log files. This leads to a type confusion.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Deserialization of untrusted data (CWE-502). The application fails to properly sanitize input during file parsing, which can be exploited.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution within the affected application.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation is triggered by opening a crafted file, likely a log file, within the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to provide a malicious file to be opened by a user of the affected application. This is typically a user-assisted attack vector, where the victim opens a malicious file provided by the attacker.
