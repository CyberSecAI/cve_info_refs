Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read in the font handling code of Adobe Acrobat Reader when parsing a specially crafted OpenType font file embedded within a PDF. Specifically, the issue occurs when processing the `gvar` table, related to glyph variations.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125):** The application fails to properly validate the size of data when parsing the `private-point-numbers` within the `gvar` table. This lack of proper validation allows the application to read beyond the allocated memory buffer.
*   The size of the `GlyphVariationData` table is not properly checked against the sum of `tvs_dataOffset` and `tvh_variationDataSize` values leading to out-of-bounds read in subsequent data parsing within a serialized block.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Leak:** Successful exploitation leads to a memory leak, allowing an attacker to potentially disclose sensitive information.
*   **Further Exploitation:** The disclosed information could potentially aid in further exploitation and bypass exploit mitigations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is a specially crafted PDF file containing a malicious embedded OpenType font.
*   The attacker needs to trick the user into opening the malicious PDF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted PDF file with a malicious font.
*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver the crafted PDF to the victim user (e.g. via email or website download).
*   The attacker is external and does not require any specific access to the victim's machine.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability occurs specifically in the processing of the `gvar` table in OpenType fonts, when the value of the `tableTag` field is the string `gvar`.
*   The `gvar` table contains a header followed by shared tuple records (`sharedTuples`) and glyph variation data tables (`GlyphVariationDataTables`).
*   The `GlyphVariationData` table contains `TupleVariationHeaders`, and serialized data. The `private-point-numbers` data within serialized data is parsed without proper size checks leading to an out-of-bounds read.
*   The vulnerability occurs because the code calculates size of GlyphVariationData by subtracting two consecutive offsets from the `glyphVariationDataOffsets` array. Later, this `GlyphVariationData_size` is used to copy the content of `GlyphVariationData` to a heap allocated buffer. If size of serialized data is more than `GlyphVariationData_size`, out-of-bounds read will occur.
*   The `private-point-numbers` data is represented as packed point numbers. The total number of point numbers is read from the `count` field without validation, which can be larger than the available space in the `GlyphVariationData` table.
*   The vulnerability occurs when the size of `GlyphVariationData` is smaller than (`tvs_dataOffset + tvh_variationDataSize_1 + tvh_variationDataSize_2 + ... + tvh_variationDataSize_n`).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered in the `CoolType` library of Adobe Acrobat Reader.
*   The vendor is not aware of any exploits in the wild for this vulnerability.
*   Cisco Talos discovered and reported the vulnerability.
