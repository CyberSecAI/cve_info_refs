| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1232341#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2024-10-25 09:01:42 UTC  ``` The security team has been contacted by an external security researcher who believes that there is an XSS vulnerability in the MirrorCache package. Following is the complete report:  > If possible, I would like to sign a CVE with this vulnerability found detailed below: >  > Reflected XSS in OpenSUSE MirrorCache Web Server > > Vulnerability Description > > A reflected XSS vulnerability was identified in the MirrorCache application > template, maintained by OpenSUSE. The MirrorCache source code is available > in the official repository: <<https://github.com/openSUSE/MirrorCache>> > <https://github.com/openSUSE/MirrorCache> and > <https://en.opensuse.org/MirrorCache> for Download. > > MirrorCache is a system developed by OpenSUSE to optimize the distribution > of software packages and updates. It acts as an intermediary layer between > the main repository servers and end-users, ensuring fast and efficient > downloads. This system can be implemented on various servers worldwide, > mirroring download repositories. > > Attack Vector > > The XSS vulnerability is reflected through two parameters in the > application's subdirectories: REGEX and P, both in uppercase. The flaw > occurs in the folder listing template of MirrorCache, allowing XSS to be > executed in any subdirectory that lists folders. > > Attack Example > > The official MirrorCache repository at > <<https://mirrorcache-us.opensuse.org/>> <https://mirrorcache-us.opensuse.org/> > was used to demonstrate the execution of XSS in the subdirectories. > > Available Subdirectories: >  >   * debug/ >   * distribution/ >   * factory/ >   * history/ >   * ports/ >   * repositories/ >   * slowroll/ >   * source/ >   * tumbleweed/ >   * update/ >  > XSS Example > > By using the REGEX and P parameters in one of the listed directories, it is > possible to generate an XSS: >  > Payload Architecture: > > [https://mirrorcache-br.opensuse.org/{{Any_Existing_Directory}}/?REGEX](https://mirrorcache-br.opensuse.org/%7B%7BAny_Existing_Directory%7D%7D/?REGEX)='"><XSS>&P='"><XSS> > > Real Example: > > <https://mirrorcache-br.opensuse.org/repositories/?REGEX=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.domain)%3C/script%3E> > <https://mirrorcache-br.opensuse.org/repositories/?P=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.domain)%3C/script%3E> > <https://mirrorcache-br.opensuse.org/debug/?REGEX=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.domain)%3C/script%3E&P=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.domain)%3C/script%3E> > > The XSS is injected in the following line of code: > > <input type="hidden" id="browse_api_url" value="/download/repositories/?jsontable&REGEX="><script>alert(document.domain)</script>"/> > > Finding Vulnerable Applications > > To find other vulnerable instances of MirrorCache on the internet, the following Dorks can be used: > > Google Dork: > > intext:”MirrorCache 1.081” > intext:”MirrorCache 1.080” > > Shodan Dork: > > <https://www.shodan.io/search?query=title%3A%22openSUSE+Download%22> > > Examples of Vulnerable Applications Available Online: >  >   * <https://mirrorcache-br.opensuse.org>: MirrorCache 1.080 >   * <https://download.opensuse.org>: MirrorCache 1.081 >   * <http://yiwusupplies.com>: MirrorCache 1.081 >   * <https://mirrorcache-us-east.firstyear.id.au>: MirrorCache 1.081 >  > Application Source Code Analysis > > Source Code: <<https://github.com/openSUSE/MirrorCache>> <https://github.com/openSUSE/MirrorCache> > > Input: Datamodule.pm File > > In the Datamodule.pm file, there is a function called re_pattern where the > application receives a URL and, if it contains the REGEX or P parameters, > stores this information without any sanitization: > > sub re_pattern($self) { >     my($regex, $glob) = ($self->regex, $self->glob); >     my $res = ''; >     $res = "&REGEX=$regex" if $regex; >     $res = "$res&P=$glob"  if $glob; >     return $res; > } > > Output: browse.html.ep File > > In the browse.html.ep file, which is the folder listing template, the result > of the re_pattern method is rendered on the screen without sanitization, > allowing XSS injection by passing the P or REGEX parameters with malicious > payloads. > > Backend: <input type="hidden" id="browse_api_url" value="/download<%= $cur_path %>/?jsontable<%==$re_pattern%>"/> > Frontend: <input type="hidden" id="browse_api_url" value="/download/repositories/?jsontable&REGEX='"><XSS>&P='"><XSS>"/> >  > Att. Erick Fernando (erickfernandox) - Security Researcher ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1232341#c1)  Matthias Gerstner   2024-10-25 09:02:56 UTC  ``` I believe this vulnerability is not public knowledge yet so we can treat this as embargoed and prepare fixes before publishing information about the vulnerability. This is up to us though. Please tell us what the best approach will be. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1232341#c4)  Matthias Gerstner   2024-10-28 09:30:32 UTC  ``` Upstream fix is already available at:  <https://github.com/openSUSE/MirrorCache/releases/tag/1.083> ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1232341#c10)  Paolo Perego   2024-10-31 09:25:25 UTC  ``` I gave a look at the patch and it seems ok to me. ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1232341#c11)  Johannes Segitz   2024-11-06 12:13:15 UTC  ``` Please use CVE-2024-49505 for this ``` |  |

## Welcome to MirrorCache!

MirrorCache is a Web Server for files download, which will route download requests to an appropriate mirror.
MirrorCache doesn't store files and instead keeps in DB list of files from the `Main Server`.

According to Wikipedia "Cache - is a component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster".
In this regard MirrorCache is a cache of (meta)information about geographical location of files.

"Cache hit" means that MirrorCache was able to redirect to proper (the closest) mirror.
"Cache miss" means that MirrorCache had to redirect request to the `Main Server`.

Output below domonstrates a cache miss, so the download request will be redirected to the `Main Server` (in this case download.opensuse.org):

```
> curl -I http://mirrorcache.opensuse.org/download/update/openSUSE-current/x86_64/alsa-1.1.5-lp152.8.6_lp152.9.4.1.x86_64.drpm
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
location: http://download.opensuse.org/update/openSUSE-current/x86_64/alsa-1.1.5-lp152.8.6_lp152.9.4.1.x86_64.drpm
date: Wed, 29 Jul 2020 08:37:07 GMT

```

Then background jobs will collect info about the hottest misses and scan predefined mirrors for presence of these files. Further requests will be redirected to one of the mirrors that has the file:

```
> curl -I http://mirrorcache.opensuse.org/download/update/openSUSE-current/x86_64/alsa-1.1.5-lp152.8.6_lp152.9.4.1.x86_64.drpm
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
location: http://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/opensuse/update/openSUSE-current/x86_64/alsa-1.1.5-lp152.8.6_lp152.9.4.1.x86_64.drpm
date: Wed, 29 Jul 2020 08:40:00 GMT

```

The project was implemented as a quick hack with some amount of shortcuts to make things going.
The goal is to improve it over time with the main focus to do the job.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to rethink architecture of mirrorbrain <https://github.com/poeml/mirrorbrain> with following features:

* job queue;
* web UI;
* fileless approach means that application doesn't require physical access to managed files;
* properly handle http/https and ipv4/ipv6 requests by picking a mirror which is able to serve that;
* geo-cluster feature allows to configure an instance per region, where each instance scan only mirrors from own region.

## About

MirrorCache is an open source framework to run a content delivery network using mirror servers. It comes with features that [MirrorBrain](/MirrorBrain "MirrorBrain") is lacking.

---

## Features

* Open source
* Job Queue, including WebUI to manage jobs (e.g. mirror scans)
* Tracks mirrors capability to serve http / https and ipv4 / ipv6 and route requests accordingly
* WebUI for managing mirrors
* Metalink generation

---

## Topology

There's no need to do anything to be able to use **MirrorCache**. That's because **MirrorCache** has become the **openSUSE** standard for download redirection. Which means that the use of `download.opensuse.org` in the baseurl for Zypper repo files can be kept, just like before.

In order to reduce latency as much as possible for users around the world --mainly when updating their systems--, several regional instances of **MirrorCache** has been deployed to mainly serve and enhance download experience for the **openSUSE** community, globally. The current high level topology looks like this:

* mirrorcache-eu.opensuse.org - European mirrors (EU);
* mirrorcache-us.opensuse.org - North America mirrors (NA);
* mirrorcache-br.opensuse.org - South American mirrors (SA);
* mirrorcache-au.opensuse.org - Oceanic mirrors (OC);
* mirrorcache-jp.opensuse.org - Japanese mirrors (JP);
* mirrorcache.opensuse.org - rest of the mirrors. Plus it redirects EU, NA, SA, OC and JP users to the corresponding instance.

Regions may also have secondary **MirrorCache** instances to better cover their territory, reducing the distance between user and server, thus reducing even more the latency.

This was made possible thanks to the *GeoIP* feature implemented on libzypp. Users should have this already in their `/etc/zypp/zypp.conf` configuration file, by default:

```
download.use_geoip_mirror = true

```

Basically, requests being made to **download.opensuse.org** will be rewritten to go to a corresponding regional **MirrorCache** instance instead, whenever possible.

You can check which regional instance Zypper should redirect requests to on [this page](https://download.opensuse.org/geoip).
## Troubleshooting

In most of cases a good start is to review `/var/log/zypper.log` and check out the output of `curl -IL` for the problematic URL, for example:

user $ `curl -IL https://download.opensuse.org/distribution/leap/15.3/iso/openSUSE-Leap-15.3-DVD-x86_64-Current.iso`

---

## How to get help

* There's usually someone around #opensuse-admin you can chat with, at libera.chat;
* For recurrent/persistent download issues, you can open a ticket by sending an email to the **openSUSE Heroes**, the **openSUSE** infrastructure sysadmins.
* You can also open an issue on the **GitHub** [repo](https://github.com/openSUSE/MirrorCache/issues/new) for software-related issues.
