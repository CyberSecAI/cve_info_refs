Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-49536:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read. This means that the software attempts to access memory locations outside the boundaries of the allocated buffer.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read which can lead to a memory leak.

*   **Impact of Exploitation**: The impact of the vulnerability is a memory leak. Though not explicitly stated, memory leaks can cause performance degradation, and potentially application instability over time if the leak is significant.

*  **Attack Vectors**: The CVSS vector string `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N` provides details:
    *   **AV:L (Attack Vector: Local)**: The attacker must have local access to the system.
    *   **AC:L (Attack Complexity: Low)**: The attack is easy to perform.
    *   **PR:N (Privileges Required: None)**: No privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability.
    *   **UI:R (User Interaction: Required)**: The user needs to perform some action to be exploited.
    *  **S:U (Scope: Unchanged)**: The vulnerability only impacts the vulnerable component.
    *   **C:H (Confidentiality: High)**: There's a high impact on the confidentiality of the data.
    *   **I:N (Integrity: None)**: There's no impact on the integrity of the data.
    *   **A:N (Availability: None)**: There's no impact on the availability of the application.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: An attacker needs to have local access to the system and the user must interact with the system in some way to trigger the vulnerability. No special privileges are needed.

**Summary:**

CVE-2024-49536 is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in Adobe Audition that can lead to a memory leak. The vulnerability can be triggered with user interaction and has a high confidentiality impact, but no impact on integrity or availability. It can be exploited with only local access and does not require any privileges.
