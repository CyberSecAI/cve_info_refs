The provided content relates to CVE-2024-49939.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability occurs due to a double addition of an interface to a list in the `rtw89` WiFi driver during a specific scenario involving System Error Recovery (SER) Level 2 during WoWLAN (Wake-on-Wireless LAN) resume.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The core issue is the lack of proper checks before adding a network interface (`rtwvif`) to the list of interfaces (`rtwdev->rtwvifs_list`). Specifically, when a SER L2 event occurs during a WoWLAN resume, the `ieee80211_reconfig()` function can be triggered multiple times. Because `rtw89_wow_resume()` may return failure, the interface add flow can execute repeatedly. This results in adding the same interface multiple times, leading to a kernel panic because the `list_add` operation detects an existing entry.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of this vulnerability is a kernel panic, causing a denial of service. The double addition to a linked list corrupts the list structure, leading to a system crash.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves triggering a specific sequence of events during WoWLAN resume, specifically causing a SER L2 event.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to be in a position to influence the system behavior to trigger a SER L2 event during the WoWLAN resume flow. This likely requires some level of control over the wireless environment or the device's power management.
