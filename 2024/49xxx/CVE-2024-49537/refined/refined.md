Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stack-based buffer overflow
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121) exists in Adobe After Effects.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to a memory leak.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L).
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not require any privileges (PR:N) and user interaction is required (UI:R).

The document also specifies that the vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 7.8, with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. This indicates the vulnerability has high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact, even though the attack vector is local.
