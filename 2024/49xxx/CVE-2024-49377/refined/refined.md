- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Jinja2 template system in OctoPrint was not configured to enforce automatic escaping, leading to reflected XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Specifically, the login dialog and the standalone application key confirmation dialog were vulnerable.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially retrieve or modify sensitive configuration settings, interrupt prints, or otherwise interact with the OctoPrint instance maliciously.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack involves tricking a victim into clicking a malicious link, possibly delivered through a third-party app, that redirects to a specially crafted URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious link and convince the victim to click it. The attack vector is adjacent, meaning the attacker needs to be in the same network or a nearby network to the victim.
