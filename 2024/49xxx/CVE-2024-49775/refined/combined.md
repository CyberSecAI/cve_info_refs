WORKAROUNDS

AND
MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:

* CVE-2024-49775:

+ Filter the ports 4002 and 4004 to only accept connections to/from the IP addresses of machines that run UMC and are part of the UMC network e.g. with an external firewall

+ In addition if no RT server machines are used, port 4004 can be blocked completely

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section
[Affected Products and Solution](#affected-products-section).

Please follow the [General Security Recommendations](#general-recommendations).
