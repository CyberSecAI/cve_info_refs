The provided content is related to CVE-2024-49360.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect access control list (ACL) settings on sandbox user directories. Specifically, when a sandbox is created for a user (e.g., UserA), the corresponding directory within `C:\Sandbox` (e.g., `C:\Sandbox\UserA`) does not have sufficiently restrictive ACLs, allowing other users (e.g., UserB) to read and potentially modify files created within that sandbox. Additionally, if a user creates a folder with malicious ACLs inside another user's sandbox, Sandboxie does not reset the ACLs before running the sandbox.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect ACLs on sandbox user directories:  The ACLs set on the sandbox user folders (`C:\Sandbox\UserA`) allow read access to other users.
- Lack of ACL reset: Sandboxie does not reset ACLs on folders inside a users sandbox if the folder is created with malicious ACLs by another user.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information disclosure:** An authenticated attacker (UserB) can read files created by other users (UserA) inside their respective sandboxes. This includes any files created or modified during sandbox processing.
- **Integrity compromise:** A malicious user (UserB) can place a malicious executable within another user's (UserA) sandbox, allowing them to gain execution within UserA's sandboxed context. This can lead to arbitrary code execution within a different userâ€™s sandboxed environment.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: An attacker needs to have local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.
- Authenticated user: An attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system.
- File system access: The attacker requires the ability to read files within the `C:\Sandbox` directory. They also need to be able to create files in the directory structure.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have a valid user account on the same system where Sandboxie is used.
- The attacker must have the ability to run commands/programs outside of any sandbox.
- The attacker must be aware of the naming convention used to create sandbox directories.

**Additional details from content:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of Sandboxie Core prior to 1.14.6 and 5.69.6.
- The vulnerability is especially critical in shared environments like RDS/Citrix servers where multiple users are using the same server.
- The suggested fix is to reset ACLs on the sandbox user directories to provide proper user isolation with correct permissions, specifically:
    - Creator Owner: FULL
    - UserXXXXX: Full
- The vulnerability can be exploited using `explorer.exe` or `cmd.exe` outside of a sandbox.
