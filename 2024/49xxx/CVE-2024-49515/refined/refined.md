**Root cause of vulnerability:** Untrusted Search Path (CWE-426)
**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application loads libraries or executables from an untrusted path
**Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution.
**Attack vectors:** An attacker can place a malicious file in an untrusted search path that the application uses. When the application attempts to load a file from that location, it will load the malicious file instead, resulting in arbitrary code execution.
**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious file in a location that is part of the untrusted search path. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerable functionality.
