- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user could perform actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users. The specific impact varies depending on the context of the vulnerable function.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through a function that lacks proper access control checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user with a "Subscriber" role, which is an unprivileged role in WordPress.
