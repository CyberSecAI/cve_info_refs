PlexRipper is a cross-platform media downloader for Plex. PlexRipper’s open CORS policy allows attackers to gain sensitive information from PlexRipper by getting the user to access the attacker’s domain. This allows an attacking website to access the /api/PlexAccount endpoint and steal the user’s Plex login. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.24.0.
