- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer Underflow (Wrap or Wraparound)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is caused by an integer underflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The CVSS vector indicates that the attack vector is local (AV:L), requiring the attacker to be present on the system where the vulnerable software is running. User interaction (UI:R) is required for exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code locally (AV:L) and require user interaction (UI:R) to trigger the vulnerability. No privileges (PR:N) are required to exploit this vulnerability.
