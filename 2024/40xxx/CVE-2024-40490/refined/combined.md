| The "Lost Password" page returns "The email address you supplied is not registered on the system" when an email address that is not registered is entered into the form.  This can allow for bruteforcing of valid email addresses.  This also works when "Normal Login" is disabled by calling the 'LostPassword' ajax call directly.
