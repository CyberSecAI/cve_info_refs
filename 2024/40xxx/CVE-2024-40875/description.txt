There is a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the
management console of Absolute Secure Access prior to version 13.52. Attackers
with system administrator permissions can interfere with another system
administratorâ€™s use of the management console when the second administrator logs
in. Attack complexity is high, attack requirements are present, privileges
required are high, user interaction required is none. The impact to
confidentiality is none, the impact to availability is low, and the impact to
system integrity is high.
