Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Improper verification of cryptographic signatures during the installation process of FortiClient MacOS.

**Root Cause:**  The application fails to properly verify the cryptographic signature of the installer package, which is downloaded and installed. Specifically, there is a race condition where an attacker can replace the genuine installer with a malicious one before the signature check takes place.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**
*   **CWE-347:** Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation allows a local authenticated attacker to execute unauthorized code or commands on the affected system by installing a malicious package.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   A local attacker needs to have authenticated access to the system.
*   The attacker exploits a race condition during the installation process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Local authenticated access to the target MacOS system.
*   Ability to manipulate files in the target system's file system during the installation process to exploit the race condition.

**Affected Versions:**
*   FortiClientMac 7.4.0
*   FortiClientMac 7.2.0 through 7.2.4
*   FortiClientMac 7.0.0 through 7.0.10
*   FortiClientMac 6.4 all versions

**Mitigation:**
*   Upgrade to FortiClientMac 7.4.1 or above
*   Upgrade to FortiClientMac 7.2.5 or above
*   Migrate to a fixed release for FortiClientMac 7.0 and 6.4 versions.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was reported by Mykola Grymalyuk from RIPEDA Consulting.
*   The severity is rated as Medium with a CVSSv3 score of 6.8 (AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:X/RC:R)
