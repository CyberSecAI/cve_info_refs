The provided content is a vulnerability report from Hanwha Vision's S-CERT team, detailing multiple CVEs affecting their NVR products.

**CVE-2024-41886**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper Input Validation.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The NVR reboots when malformed data is entered into specific URL input parameters. This indicates a lack of proper input validation and error handling in the web interface.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can intentionally cause the NVR to reboot. This could lead to denial of service. The attack can be carried out continuously.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP request to the NVR's web admin interface with malformed data in specific URL parameters.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires access to the NVR's web admin page. This suggests that authentication might be required, or the attacker has access to the network where the NVR is located.
