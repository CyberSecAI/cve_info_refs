- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The software uses external input to construct a pathname without properly neutralizing special elements, allowing the pathname to resolve to a location outside the intended restricted directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path traversal vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization when constructing file paths.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - An attacker could fetch sensitive files.
    - An attacker could change configuration files (e.g., web.xml).
    - Web content could be defaced.
    - Malicious code could be injected by modifying libraries.
    - Access to system files may be gained depending on the application server's permissions.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can send a specially crafted request containing path traversal sequences within the file path to access or modify files outside the intended directory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application server and have knowledge of the path traversal syntax. The attacker does not need to be authenticated in this specific bulletin description but will likely need network access to the application server.
