Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of plaintext password fields within IBM Engineering Lifecycle Management - IBM Jazz.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Sensitive information, specifically passwords, are stored and handled in plaintext format.
- This leads to unintentional information leakage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information, such as user credentials due to the plaintext exposure of passwords.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The document does not specify an attack vector but rather highlights the vulnerability stemming from the application's internal architecture, suggesting an internal attack vector such as unauthorized access to logs or other data stores where plaintext passwords might be present.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The document does not explicitly define the attacker capabilities required for exploitation but suggests the attacker would need to gain unauthorized access to the location where the plaintext passwords are being stored.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Jazz Foundation (7.1.0, 7.0.3, and 7.0.2).
- Fixes are available for each affected version as iFixes.
- IBM advises users on older versions to upgrade to a supported version and apply the fixes.
