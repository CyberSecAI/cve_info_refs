## Description of contribution in a few bullet points

result from experiments

In `amcl` node, the following code could completely shutdown the callback threads properly:

```
  // shutdown and reset dynamic parameter handler
  remove_on_set_parameters_callback(dyn_params_handler_.get());
  dyn_params_handler_.reset();
```
## Future work that may be required in bullet points

Here's a todo list for my future work, I think I'd check out package by package:

* nav2\_amcl (fixed)
* nav2\_behavior\_tree (no dynamic\_param)
* nav2\_behaviors (no dynamic\_param)
* nav2\_bringup (no dynamic\_param)
* nav2\_bt\_navigator
* nav2\_collision\_monitor
* nav2\_common
* nav2\_constrained\_smoother
* nav2\_controller
* nav2\_core
* nav2\_costmap\_2d
* nav2\_docking
* nav2\_dwb\_controller
* nav2\_graceful\_controller
* nav2\_lifecycle\_manager
* nav2\_map\_server
* nav2\_mppi\_controller
* nav2\_msgs (no dynamic param)
* nav2\_navfn\_planner
* nav2\_planner
* nav2\_regulated\_pure\_pursuit\_controller
* nav2\_rotation\_shim\_controller
* nav2\_rviz\_plugins
* nav2\_simple\_commander
* nav2\_smac\_planner
* nav2\_smoother
* nav2\_system\_tests
* nav2\_theta\_star\_planner
* nav2\_util
* nav2\_velocity\_smoother
* nav2\_voxel\_grid
* nav2\_waypoint\_follower

This PR is opened as a demo. If there are no issues here, I will quickly check and correct all remaining packages, and then update this PR in one go.

| This seems to cause a number of crashes, according to the test results. I retriggered to see if it was a fluke, but it doesn't appear to be from my intuition |

| It seems that in the test, some dyn\_param\_handler instances might not be registered, which can lead to related errors during resource release. I am currently making adjustments. |

| Bug report **Required Info:**   * Operating System:   + ubuntu22.04 * ROS2 Version:   + humble & Iron * Version or commit hash:   + the latest * DDS implementation:   + the defaulted  Steps to reproduce issue  1. Launch the navigation2 as following steps:  ``` #!/bin/bash export ASAN_OPTIONS=halt_on_error=0:new_delete_type_mismatch=0:detect_leaks=0:log_pah=asan source install/setup.bash export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH:/opt/ros/humble/share/turtlebot3_gazebo/models ros2 launch nav2_bringup tb3_simulation_launch.py headless:=True use_rviz:=False use_composition:=False  ```  2. sending request for change any dynamic\_parameter of `nav2_amcl`, like following one:  ``` ros2 param set amcl scan_topic scan ```  3. deacitvate and cleanup nav2\_amcl, like by press `Ctrl+C`  Expected behavior no UAF bug Actual behavior UAF bug occured during `on_cleanup()` of nav2\_amcl, the asan report is as following;  ```

executing `on_cleanup()`. And `on_cleanup()` would release many resources of nav2\_amcl but the callback thread would access those released resources, so that the UAF bug occurs. |

| However, I noticed that during `deactivate()`, `dyn_handler_.reset()` is executed to try to stop the dynamic parameter callback thread:   [navigation2/nav2\_amcl/src/amcl\_node.cpp](https://github.com/ros-navigation/navigation2/blob/715df8f3477f6ed1c023d8f928e321bb18c403e5/nav2_amcl/src/amcl_node.cpp#L304-L316)  Lines 304 to 316 in [715df8f](/ros-navigation/navigation2/commit/715df8f3477f6ed1c023d8f928e321bb18c403e5)   |  | nav2\_util::CallbackReturn | | --- | --- | |  | AmclNode::on\_deactivate(const rclcpp\_lifecycle::State & /\*state\*/) | |  | { | |  | RCLCPP\_INFO(get\_logger(), "Deactivating"); | |  |  | |  | active\_ = false; | |  |  | |  | // Lifecycle publishers must be explicitly deactivated | |  | pose\_pub\_->on\_deactivate(); | |  | particle\_cloud\_pub\_->on\_deactivate(); | |  |  | |  | // reset dynamic parameter handler | |  | dyn\_params\_handler\_.reset(); |      But it seems that it doesn't actually achieve this, so I conducted the following experiment to verify: Experiment:Proving that the callback function continues to execute even after `dyn_handler_.reset()` and `executor_thread_.reset()`: Insert delay and log:  ``` /**   * @brief Callback executed when a parameter change is detected   * @param event ParameterEvent message   */ rcl_interfaces::msg::SetParametersResult AmclNode::dynamicParametersCallback(   std::vector<rclcpp::Parameter> parameters) {   std::lock_guard<std::recursive_mutex> cfl(mutex_);   rcl_interfaces::msg::SetParametersResult result; // insert RCLCPP_INFO(get_logger(), "-----------------------dynamicParamCallback Called!"); std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(5)); RCLCPP_INFO(get_logger(), "-----------------------dynamicParamCallback still executing!"); // ... ... ```  ``` nav2_util::CallbackReturn AmclNode::on_cleanup(const rclcpp_lifecycle::State & /*state*/) {   RCLCPP_INFO(get_logger(), "Cleaning up");    executor_thread_.reset(); // insert  RCLCPP_INFO(get_logger(), "-------------------After executor_thread_.reset()"); // ```  Then, run navigation2 and publish a dynamic parameter change request, such as `ros2 param set amcl min_particles 500`. Immediately after sending the request, press Ctrl+C to let navigation2 sequentially execute the `on_deactivate()` and `on_cleanup()` phases. We will see the following logs:  ``` ... ...

| Perhaps we need to <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/blob/8230d15ef7ffa9e824d7e0f9c623537ae331dc73/rclcpp/src/rclcpp/node.cpp#L475-L479> `remove_on_set_parameters_callback` rather than just resetting the `std::function`. That would apply to your other ticket (and all other Nav2 servers). If so, then you could close that other ticket and rename this one about that general problem. It should be pretty fast to batch out, there's about ~30 uses of the dynamic parameter callback, but it should all just be copy-paste adding 1 line before the reset:  ``` node->remove_on_set_parameters_callback( dyn_handler_);  dyn_handler_.reset();  ``` |

| Sure! My future work will follow these steps:   * Conduct experiments to ensure `node->remove_on_set_parameters_callback(dyn_handler_);` could shutdown the callback threads properly. * Review all other instances where the dynamic parameter callback is used and correct them as necessary.   Perhaps I'm not good at renaming issues, so feel free to modify it if it seems inappropriate. 😜 |
