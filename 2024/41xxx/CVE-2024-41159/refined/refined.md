- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` entitlement being set to `true` in Microsoft OneNote for macOS. This disables the program's defense against library hijacking, allowing unsigned dynamic libraries to be loaded.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **Library Injection**: The application loads libraries through relative paths and due to the disabled library validation, a malicious library can be injected.
    - **Privilege Escalation/Permission Bypass**: By injecting a malicious library, an attacker can leverage the permissions of the OneNote application.

-  **Impact of exploitation**:
    - An attacker can leverage the permissions of the vulnerable application, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the system's resources.
    - The attacker could record audio, send emails via Microsoft Outlook, exfiltrate data, and perform other actions based on the entitlements granted to the OneNote application.
    - If the required permission hasn't yet been granted to OneNote, the application will request user permission, potentially tricking the user into granting it due to trust in the Microsoft app.

- **Attack vectors**:
    -  A local, unprivileged attacker can copy the application to a controllable location.
    -  The attacker can then perform a library injection by placing a malicious library in the appropriate relative path that will be loaded by the application.
    - Starting the application will trigger the vulnerability.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    -  Local access to the system where the vulnerable version of OneNote is installed.
    -  Ability to modify the file system of the system where OneNote is installed.
