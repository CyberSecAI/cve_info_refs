```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The `com.microsoft.teams2.modulehost.app` helper app in Microsoft Teams for macOS has the `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` entitlement set to true, which disables the hardened runtime's protection against dynamic library hijacking.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Library injection vulnerability due to the disabled library validation, allowing loading of unsigned dynamic libraries.
- Impact of exploitation: A malicious application can inject a library into the vulnerable helper app and leverage the app's permissions to access the camera, microphone, location, and other sensitive resources. This can lead to unauthorized access to photos, audio recording, data exfiltration, and more.
- Attack vectors: A malicious application can perform a library injection in `com.microsoft.teams2.modulehost.app` by placing a crafted library in a location where it will be loaded by the app.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to execute a malicious application on the target system and copy the vulnerable application to a controlled location to perform library injection.
