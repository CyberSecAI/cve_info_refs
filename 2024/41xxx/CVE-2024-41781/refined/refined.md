- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An attacker with service access to the HMC (Hardware Management Console) can decrypt data within the Platform KeyStore.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the ability of an attacker with service access to decrypt data in the Platform KeyStore.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to decrypt data stored in the Platform KeyStore.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through service access to the HMC.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to gain service access to the HMC.
