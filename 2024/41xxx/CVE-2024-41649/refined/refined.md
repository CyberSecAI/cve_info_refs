{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `executor_thread_` in `nav2_costmap_ros` was not being reset early enough during the cleanup process, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. The thread could continue to run and access freed memory after the `Costmap2DROS` object was destroyed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free vulnerability due to incorrect resource cleanup order.",
      "Race condition during shutdown where the costmap thread could access freed memory."
    ],
    "impact": "A crash or undefined behavior due to accessing freed memory. This vulnerability can cause the navigation system to fail.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Normal operation of the navigation system, specifically when shutting down or canceling goals.",
       "The vulnerability is triggered during the shutdown process when a goal is cancelled before completion"
    ],
      "required_capabilities": "No special attacker capabilities are required. The issue can be triggered by normal usage of the navigation system.",
    "additional_information": "The fix involves reordering the cleanup process in `Costmap2DROS::on_cleanup` to reset the `executor_thread_` before other resources are deallocated. A delay inserted in `Costmap2DROS::getRobotPose()` could reliably trigger the issue."
