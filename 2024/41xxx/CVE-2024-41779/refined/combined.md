To return expected results, you can:

* **Reduce the number of search terms.** Each term you use focuses the search further.
* **Check your spelling.** A single misspelled or incorrectly typed term can change your result.
* **Try substituting synonyms for your original terms.** For example, instead of searching for "java classes", try "java training"
* **Did you search for an IBM acquired or sold product ?** If so, follow the appropriate link below to find the content you need.

# Security Bulletin: IBM Engineering Systems Design Rhapsody - Model Manager - Race Condition Format Flaw (Uses of non-thread safe SimpleDateFormat.format() when enabling DEBUG log for IDMappingsService.verbose)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

In 'IBM Engineering Systems Design Rhapsody - Model Manager [RMM]' if DEBUG logging is enabled for 'IDMappingsService.verbose', then there is a possibility of an incorrect date being written to the logs, or the possibility of an exception being thrown (due to a race-condition involving the use of SimpleDateFormat.format()). Note: DEBUG level logging is NOT enabled for RMM's IDMappingsService by default, thus there is no risk of this situation happening under normal operation of RMM. Instructions of how to enable DEBUG logging is generally given on a case-by-case basis by IBM support, and the debug log output in this case (which 'may' have an incorrect date written) is generally expected to be inspected by IBM support and/or development.

## Workarounds and Mitigations

Do not enable DEBUG logging for 'IDMappingsService.verbose'.

Note: Enabling DEBUG logging of IDMappingsService is not impacted by this vulnerability. i.e. it is still safe to enable:

<Logger name="com.ibm.team.rmm.models.service.internal.IDMappingsService" level="DEBUG">

## Disclaimer

According to the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an "industry open standard designed to convey vulnerability severity and help to determine urgency and priority of response." IBM PROVIDES THE CVSS SCORES ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. CUSTOMERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF ANY ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY. In addition to other efforts to address potential vulnerabilities, IBM periodically updates the record of components contained in our product offerings. As part of that effort, if IBM identifies previously unidentified packages in a product/service inventory, we address relevant vulnerabilities regardless of CVE date. Inclusion of an older CVEID does not demonstrate that the referenced product has been used by IBM since that date, nor that IBM was aware of a vulnerability as of that date. We are making clients aware of relevant vulnerabilities as we become aware of them. "Affected Products and Versions" referenced in IBM Security Bulletins are intended to be only products and versions that are supported by IBM and have not passed their end-of-support or warranty date. Thus, failure to reference unsupported or extended-support products and versions in this Security Bulletin does not constitute a determination by IBM that they are unaffected by the vulnerability. Reference to one or more unsupported versions in this Security Bulletin shall not create an obligation for IBM to provide fixes for any unsupported or extended-support products or versions.
