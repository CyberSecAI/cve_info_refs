RISK ANALYSIS

CVE

Review Opinion

Severity

CVE-2024-41887

An  attacker  can  exploit  the  log generation  feature  in  the  NVR to

generate logs in a directory one level higher than the specified log

generation directory. However, the attacker needs to have ADMIN

authentication privileges on the NVR, and cannot change the path

to  any other  directory.  Because  the  exploit  is  so  limited, it  is  not

low

attractive to attackers.

An attacker can intentionally cause the NVR to reboot by entering

CVE-2024-41886

malformed data into certain URL input parameters. This has the

medium

limitation that the attacker needs access to the NVR's web admin

3

page. However, this attack can be carried out continuously, so it is

recommended to update to patched firmware.

The seed string for the encrypt key was hardcoding. This issue can

be escalated to an issue where the NVR firmware decryption key

CVE-2024-41885

can be reproduced if the seed string is leaked. but, reverse-

engineering the encrypted NVR firmware to verify the seed string

is a difficult task. Nevertheless, we recommend updating to

low

patched firmware.

an attacker does not enter a specific URL parameter value, a NULL

pointer reference occurs and the NVR is rebooted. This attack is

CVE-2024-41884

limited in that it requires privileges to be successful, but it is

medium

recommended to update to the patched firmware as it can be

continuously attacked.

an attacker enters a specific value for a specific URL parameter

value, a NULL pointer reference occurs and the NVR is rebooted.

CVE-2024-41883

This attack is limited in that it requires privileges to be successful,

medium

but it is recommended to update to the patched firmware as it can

be continuously attacked.

An attacker can cause a stack overflow by entering large data into

URL parameters, which will result in NVR reboot. This attack is

CVE-2024-41882

limited in that it requires privileges to be successful, but it is

medium

recommended to update to the patched firmware as it can be

continuously attacked.

  Solution and Required Action

-  Please  update  the  affected  models  with  the  latest  firmware  as  soon  as  possible.  It  is

recommended to use the Wisenet Device Manager tool to download & update device firmware.

Firmware can also be downloaded from Hanwha Vision websites.
