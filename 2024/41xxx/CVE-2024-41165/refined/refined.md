- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the presence of the `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` entitlement set to `true` in the Microsoft Word application for macOS. This entitlement disables the Hardened Runtime's protection against library hijacking.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the allowance of loading unsigned dynamic libraries due to the disabled library validation. This permits a malicious application to inject a specially crafted library into the Microsoft Word process.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to a permission bypass, allowing the injected library to utilize Microsoft Wordâ€™s entitlements. This could lead to a range of malicious actions, including recording audio, sending emails via Outlook, accessing the Pictures folder, and exfiltrating data. If Word does not already have permissions granted for requested actions, it will trigger a permission prompt which could mislead users into granting permissions based on trust in the Microsoft application.

- **Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to copy the Microsoft Word application to a controllable location. Subsequently, they could perform a library injection by placing a malicious library in a path that Word loads from when it starts. Starting the application will load this malicious library, and this injected code will execute with the permissions of the Word process.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to copy the application, place a malicious library in the expected location relative to the application, and then launch the application.
