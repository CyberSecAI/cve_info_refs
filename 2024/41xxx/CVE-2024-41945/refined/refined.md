- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `fund` function in the `fuels-ts/packages/account/src/account.ts` file retrieves UTXOs statelessly using `getResourcesToSpend` without considering already used UTXOs within the same block. This can lead to the same UTXO being used in multiple transactions within the same block.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the lack of state management for UTXOs used in pending transactions. The `getResourcesToSpend` function does not exclude UTXOs that have already been used in other transactions that have not yet been included in a block.
- **Impact of exploitation**: This can cause transactions to fail or be silently pruned from the transaction pool, resulting in unexpected SDK behavior. Specifically:
    - Transactions may not be included in the `txpool` or a block.
    - A previous transaction can be silently removed from the `txpool` and replaced by a new transaction using the same UTXO.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting multiple transactions within the same block that rely on the same UTXO. This can be achieved through a series of rapid transaction submissions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to submit multiple transactions to the Fuel network using the affected SDK version. No special privileges are required beyond being a regular user of the `fuels-ts` SDK. The attacker needs to be able to generate multiple transactions using the vulnerable `fund` function.
