The provided content is related to CVE-2024-41206.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A stack buffer over-read vulnerability exists in the `TS_program_map_section::extractPMTDescriptors` function. This occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when extracting PMT descriptors.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Stack buffer over-read in `TS_program_map_section::extractPMTDescriptors`
- Lack of size validation before calling `extractPMTDescriptors` with `program_info_len`

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to cause a crash due to a stack buffer overflow
- The provided ASAN output indicates the program aborts due to the detected stack buffer overflow

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a crafted Transport Stream (TS) file
- The vulnerability is triggered when parsing the Program Map Table (PMT) descriptors

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to supply a crafted TS file as input to the application.
- No special privileges are required, as the vulnerability occurs within the application's normal processing of the file.
