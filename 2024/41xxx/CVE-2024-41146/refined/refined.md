- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Use of Multiple Resources with Duplicate Identifier (CWE-694)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from the use of multiple resources with duplicate identifiers in the Controller 6000 and Controller 7000 platforms.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with physical access to HBUS communication cabling can perform a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack against HBUS-connected devices. This requires a device reboot to resolve.
- **Attack vectors:** Physical access to HBUS communication cabling is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs physical access to the HBUS communication cabling.
