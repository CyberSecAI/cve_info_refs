{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference that occurs during the shutdown of the ROS2 navigation system (Nav2). The `costmap_ros_` node, a lifecycle node, is being deactivated/shutdown before the controller server, causing the controller to access freed memory of the costmap.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer dereference",
      "Improper shutdown sequence",
      "Race condition during shutdown"
    ],
    "impact": "The impact is a crash of the navigation system, specifically due to a segmentation fault (SEGV) when the controller attempts to access the freed `costmap_ros_` object, which can lead to denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Normal use during shutdown",
       "Triggering shutdown sequence"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "No special capabilities are required, the vulnerability occurs during normal shutdown process."
