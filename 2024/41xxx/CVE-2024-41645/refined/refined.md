      "root_cause": "The `dyn_params_handler_` in the `inflation_layer_` is not properly shutdown, leading to a use-after-free condition when the callback thread continues to execute after the `inflation_layer_` object is destroyed.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use-after-free (UAF)",
        "Incomplete shutdown of dynamic parameter handler callback threads"

      "impact": "Heap-use-after-free vulnerability that can lead to crashes and potentially arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability occurs during the shutdown of the navigation system when the `costmap_ros_` node is cleaned up, causing the `inflation_layer_` to be released. If a callback is still running, it will access the freed memory.",
      "required_capabilities": "No special attacker capabilities are mentioned, this is a bug that occurs during normal use of the software."
