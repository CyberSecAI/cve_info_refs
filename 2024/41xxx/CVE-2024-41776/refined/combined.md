These definitions can be found on the following IBM PSIRT News page: <https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6610583>

Affected: The software product contains code, which has a documented vulnerability. Based on currently available information, however, we believe that the issue is likely not exploitable. However, as a best practice and from an abundance of caution, we recommend customers update their systems as soon as practical. Vulnerabilities evolve, and a means of exploiting any issue may emerge at any time.

Vulnerable: The software product contains code, which has a documented vulnerability. Our analysis shows that the issue may be exploitable.

Affected/Vulnerable Products and Versions: As used in IBM Security Bulletins, this category is intended to be only products and versions that are supported by IBM, and have not passed their end-of-support or warranty date. Thus, not including a reference in a Security Bulletin to unsupported or extended-support products or versions does not indicate a determination by IBM that they are unaffected by the vulnerability. Additionally, including a reference to one or more unsupported versions in a Security Bulletin (including reference to "All" versions) does not create an obligation for IBM to provide fixes for any unsupported or extended-support products or versions.

## Disclaimer

According to the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an "industry open standard designed to convey vulnerability severity and help to determine urgency and priority of response." IBM PROVIDES THE CVSS SCORES ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. CUSTOMERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF ANY ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY. In addition to other efforts to address potential vulnerabilities, IBM periodically updates the record of components contained in our product offerings. As part of that effort, if IBM identifies previously unidentified packages in a product/service inventory, we address relevant vulnerabilities regardless of CVE date. Inclusion of an older CVEID does not demonstrate that the referenced product has been used by IBM since that date, nor that IBM was aware of a vulnerability as of that date. We are making clients aware of relevant vulnerabilities as we become aware of them. "Affected Products and Versions" referenced in IBM Security Bulletins are intended to be only products and versions that are supported by IBM and have not passed their end-of-support or warranty date. Thus, failure to reference unsupported or extended-support products and versions in this Security Bulletin does not constitute a determination by IBM that they are unaffected by the vulnerability. Reference to one or more unsupported versions in this Security Bulletin shall not create an obligation for IBM to provide fixes for any unsupported or extended-support products or versions.
