The provided content is related to CVE-2024-54675.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a stored XSS issue in the editor interface for ad-hoc workflows within the MISP project. Specifically, the vulnerability lies within the Javascript template file `workflows-editor.js`. The code uses `doT.template` to create templates for different block types and the data is not being sanitized before being rendered into the HTML.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the workflow editor interface, which are then stored and executed when other users interact with the affected workflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- When a user views the crafted workflow, the malicious JavaScript will execute. An attacker can leverage this to perform actions on behalf of the victim user, including but not limited to data exfiltration, session hijacking or modifying data within the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker would need to be able to create a workflow and inject the malicious payload via workflow module data, such as module name or description or parameters, within the editor.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to create or modify a workflow. This likely requires some form of authorized access to the application.
