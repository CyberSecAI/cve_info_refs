{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The LeaderBoard Plugin for WordPress lacks proper CSRF protection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The plugin does not implement adequate measures to prevent CSRF attacks.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor could force a higher-privileged user to execute unwanted actions while they are authenticated. The specific impact depends on the context and functionality of the plugin.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker could craft a malicious link or website to trick an authenticated user into performing unintended actions on the vulnerable WordPress site.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They need to be able to entice a logged-in, privileged user to click a malicious link or visit a malicious website to trigger the CSRF attack."
