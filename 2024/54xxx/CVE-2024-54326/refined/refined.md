The provided content relates to CVE-2024-54326.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function of the GEO my WordPress plugin. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should be restricted to higher privileged users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Broken Access Control: The plugin lacks proper checks to verify if a user has the necessary permissions to perform certain actions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unprivileged user (specifically, a "Subscriber") can perform actions that are meant to be executed by more privileged roles. This could lead to unauthorized changes, data breaches, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through the plugin's functions that lack proper authorization controls.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a "Subscriber" role on the WordPress site, which is a low-privilege role.
