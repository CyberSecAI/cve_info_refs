- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The MDC Comment Toolbar Plugin <= 1.1 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: Through a CSRF attack, a malicious actor can induce an authenticated user to perform actions without their knowledge or consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a higher-privileged user into performing an action by sending a crafted request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
