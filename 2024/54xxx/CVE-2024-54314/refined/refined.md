- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization or output encoding that allows for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads, into the website. These scripts will be executed when guests visit the site.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious scripts into input fields that are not properly sanitized or encoded, which are then displayed on the website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious scripts, which might require contributor level privileges.
