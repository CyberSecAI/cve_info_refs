- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Heap-based buffer overflow occurs while parsing specially crafted PAR files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. This could lead to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when the application opens a malicious PAR file. An attacker needs to entice a user to open a specially crafted PAR file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to create a malicious PAR file and trick a user into opening it with the vulnerable application.
