See: <https://blog.zimbra.com/2024/04/admin-account-authentication-now-honors-zimbraauthfallbacktolocal/>

Check out the [Security Fixes](#Security_Fixes) sections for this version of Zimbra Collaboration.
Please refer to the **[Patch Installation](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/10.0.0/patch_installation)** steps for Patch Installation instructions.
As always, you are encouraged to tell us what you think in the Forums or open a support ticket to report issues.

**IMPORTANT: Instructions to update Zimbra's onlyoffice repository for installing zimbra-onlyoffice package.**

Please note that there is no change in the onlyoffice package. Add Zimbra's onlyoffice repository to the server before Zimbra Daffodil v10 installation/upgrade. These repos will be included bydefault in upcoming Zimbra Daffodil version.

```
https://repo.zimbra.com/apt/onlyoffice

```
```
https://repo.zimbra.com/rpm/onlyoffice

```

You must add your local repository to your RHEL/CentOS Configuration :

**Redhat**

RHEL7

```
$ cat > /etc/yum.repos.d/zimbra-onlyoffice.repo <<EOF
[zimbra-onlyoffice]
name=Zimbra Onlyoffice RPM Repository
baseurl=https://repo.zimbra.com/rpm/onlyoffice/rhel7
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
EOF

```

RHEL8

```
$ cat > /etc/yum.repos.d/zimbra-onlyoffice.repo <<EOF
[zimbra-onlyoffice]
name=Zimbra Onlyoffice RPM Repository
baseurl=https://repo.zimbra.com/rpm/onlyoffice/rhel8
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
EOF

```
```
rpm --import <https://files.zimbra.com/downloads/security/public.key>
yum --disablerepo=* --enablerepo=zimbra-onlyoffice clean metadata
yum check-update --disablerepo=* --enablerepo=zimbra-onlyoffice --noplugins

```

**Ubuntu**

UBUNTU18

```
$ cat > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/zimbra-onlyoffice.list << EOF
deb [arch=amd64] https://repo.zimbra.com/apt/onlyoffice bionic zimbra
deb-src [arch=amd64] https://repo.zimbra.com/apt/onlyoffice bionic zimbra
EOF

```

UBUNTU20

```
$ cat > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/zimbra-onlyoffice.list << EOF
deb [arch=amd64] https://repo.zimbra.com/apt/onlyoffice focal zimbra
deb-src [arch=amd64] https://repo.zimbra.com/apt/onlyoffice focal zimbra
EOF

```
```
apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 9BE6ED79
apt-get update

```

**IMPORTANT: Incase above steps are missed for Onlyoffice installation, following is the manual steps for installation.**

* As root user run below commands: (assuming Zimbra is already installed)

```
$ wget -O /opt/zimbra/bin/zmonlyofficeinstall <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zimbra/zm-core-utils/10.0.9/src/bin/zmonlyofficeinstall>
$ chmod 755 /opt/zimbra/bin/zmonlyofficeinstall
$ /opt/zimbra/bin/zmonlyofficeinstall

```

**IMPORTANT: Zimbra OpenSSL with default FIPS Configuration**

* Please be advised that, TLS 1.2 is the minimum supported version if FIPS is being used with OpenSSL 3.0. We recommend using Zimbra with strong TLS configuration for increased security. Please follow instructions in **[Cipher-suites-wiki](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Cipher_suites)** to set correct ciphers as per current versions of openssl, nginx and postfix.
* From this patch going forward Zimbra OpenSSL will be configured to work with FIPS compliance enabled by default. You do not need to take any action, unless you run into issues, you can switch to the non-FIPS provider as follows:

* Run below commands to Enable/Disable FIPS providers on all servers.

Disable FIPS provider:

```
As root user run below commands

Take backup of openssl.cnf
cd /opt/zimbra/common/etc/ssl
cp openssl.cnf <backup-path>/openssl.cnf

Copy openssl-source.cnf file
cd /opt/zimbra/common/etc/ssl
cp openssl-source.cnf openssl.cnf

Verify that, FIPS provider is disabled:
Run below command and verify fips provider is not listed
/opt/zimbra/common/bin/openssl list --providers

As zimbra user run below commands
su - zimbra
zmcontrol restart

```

Enable FIPS provider:

```
As root user run below commands

Take backup of openssl.cnf
cd /opt/zimbra/common/etc/ssl
cp openssl.cnf <backup-path>/openssl.cnf

Copy openssl-fips.cnf file
cd /opt/zimbra/common/etc/ssl
cp openssl-fips.cnf openssl.cnf

Verify that, FIPS provider is enabled:
Run below command and verify fips provider is listed
/opt/zimbra/common/bin/openssl list --providers

As zimbra user run below commands
su - zimbra
zmcontrol restart

```

**NOTICE: OpenJDK cacert Package Upgrade**

Please follow the instructions:

```
Install zimbra-core-components before the patch upgrade on the mailstore node.
apt-get install zimbra-core-components (For Ubuntu)
yum install zimbra-core-components (For RHEL/Centos/Rocky Linux)

```

While deploying zimlets, if the following error is encountered

```
Enabling Zimlet zimbra-zimlet-secure-mail
ERROR: zclient.IO_ERROR (invoke PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target, server:  localhost) (cause: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to  requested target)
*** zimbra-zimlet-secure-mail Installation Completed. ***
*** Restart the mailbox service as zimbra user. Run ***

```

then, redeploy zimlets that are throwing error in the patch upgrade

```
zmzimletctl -l deploy <zimlet.zip file name>

```

# What's New

## Package Upgrade

* The Apache package has been upgraded from 2.4.57 to 2.4.62
* The ClamAV package has been upgraded from 1.0.1 to 1.0.6
* The OpenJDK package has been upgraded from 17.0.8 to 17.0.12
# Fixed Issues

## Zimbra Collaboration

* When creating a draft in a Web App with the subject and body containing special characters (Č, ć, ž, š, đ), syncing it with Gmail where the user's account is configured using ActiveSync and then editing the draft in Gmail results in unexpected characters (e.g., ?) appearing when syncing back to ZWC. The issue has been fixed and the characters now appear correctly.
* Autocomplete now displays correct results when typing the initials of the user.
* When using the external warning feature, in some cases the emails were not displayed correctly due to incorrect order of the Content-Type parameter in the email header. The issue has been fixed.
* When using SSDB, the last login details of the user get correctly updated.
* Due to incorrect handling of the "X-Forwarded-For" header, when a repeated login failure occurs, the server suspends the wrong IP address. The issue has been fixed and it now suspends the correct IP address.

## Modern Web App

**Mail**

* When viewing a message if there are any distribution lists to which the mail is sent to then the distribution list were being displayed twice.

**Briefcase**

* If is a new sub-folder is created by the user that sub-folder was displayed twice instead of once. The issue has been resolved.

* Sync options only appear if mobile sync is enabled, earlier they appeared irrespective of the value of zimbraFeatureMobileSyncEnabled.
* Users are now warned about deceptive URLs using hyperlink validation. If the displayed text does not match the underlying URL, users are warned about it. This feature helps prevent phishing attacks. Users can opt to proceed despite the warning.
* Organization-wide signature templates introduced, allowing administrators to set email signatures for all users. Users can apply and further customize these templates.
* New users of Zimbra Modern UI will now be guided through an interactive tutorial on their first login, introducing key features like navigation, mail management, and settings. The tutorial enhances the onboarding experience and can be skipped at any time.

# Fixed Issues

## Zimbra Collaboration

* When creating a draft in a Web App with the subject and body containing special characters (Č, ć, ž, š, đ), syncing it with Gmail where the user's account is configured using ActiveSync and then editing the draft in Gmail results in unexpected characters (e.g., ?) appearing when syncing back to ZWC. The issue has been fixed and the characters now appear correctly.
* Autocomplete now displays correct results when typing the initials of the user.
* When using the external warning feature, in some cases the emails were not displayed correctly due to incorrect order of the Content-Type parameter in the email header. The issue has been fixed.
* When using SSDB, the last login details of the user get correctly updated.
* Due to incorrect handling of the "X-Forwarded-For" header, when a repeated login failure occurs, the server suspends the wrong IP address. The issue has been fixed and it now suspends the correct IP address.

* Resolved multiple translation issues in Modern UI.

**Mail**

* "Edit as New," "New Event," and "Print" functionalities do not work when the preview pane is disabled in the Zimbra Modern UI. As a workaround, please enable the preview pane to use these features.

## Mail

* EML file importing is now working on Zimbra version 10.0.0 and above.
