- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WP Flipkart Importer plugin lacks sufficient protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin is vulnerable to CSRF.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions on the plugin under their current authentication. This could lead to unauthorized changes or actions within the plugin's context.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is carried out by tricking an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious page. This initiates actions on the vulnerable plugin that the user is already authenticated to use.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to entice a logged-in user to perform an action (e.g. clicking a link) on a malicious page or link. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the application, as the attack leverages the valid authentication of the victim. The attacker also requires knowledge of the vulnerable plugin and how to form a request to it.
