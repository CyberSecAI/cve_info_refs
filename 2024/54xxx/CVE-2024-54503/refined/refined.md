The provided document includes information about CVE-2024-54503.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** An inconsistent user interface issue in the Audio component.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Muting a call while ringing may not result in mute being enabled. This indicates a flaw in the state management of the audio muting feature.

**Impact of exploitation:** The user may believe the call is muted when it is not, potentially exposing their audio to others.

**Attack vectors:** Triggering a call while ringing and attempting to mute it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a call with the target and induce the target to mute the call while the call is ringing. This would likely require user interaction from the target user to trigger the vulnerability, and therefore not directly remote exploitable in a classic sense.
