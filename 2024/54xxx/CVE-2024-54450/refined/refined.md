- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Kurmi Provisioning Suite 7.9.0.33 application uses the IP address from the X-Forwarded-For header, if present, instead of the actual source IP address during authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Log pollution, IP address spoofing
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A malicious actor can forge the X-Forwarded-For header to make the Kurmi application log a fake IP address. This spoofed IP can be displayed in the "My Account" popup, potentially misleading users or administrators about the origin of a login session. This could be used to obscure malicious activity or give a false sense of legitimacy.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the Kurmi application, including a forged "X-Forwarded-For" header.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the Kurmi application with a manipulated X-Forwarded-For header. No specific prior access is mentioned.
