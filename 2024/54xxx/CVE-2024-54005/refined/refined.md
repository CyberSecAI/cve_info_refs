**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The PDMS/E3D Engineering Interface in Siemens COMOS improperly handles XML External Entity (XXE) entries when communicating with an external application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- XXE Injection (CWE-611): The application improperly parses XML data, allowing an attacker to inject malicious XML code to include external entities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file extraction: An attacker could potentially extract any file with a known location on the user's system or accessible network folders. This could lead to exposure of sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
- By injecting malicious data into the communication channel between the two systems (COMOS and the external application).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious XML data into the communication channel between COMOS and an external application.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated (PR:N)

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory notes that simply setting the "read-only" property on configuration files is not a sufficient security measure.
- The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of COMOS and fixed in some versions with patches available upon request. In some other versions no fix is planned, and workaround mitigations are advised
