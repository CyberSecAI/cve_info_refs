- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue on the `_table_id` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: XSS vulnerability which leads to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) breach.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The attacker can potentially execute malicious scripts in the context of the user's browser session, leading to unauthorized actions or data access due to the CSRF breach.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), requiring user interaction (UI:R) and low privileges (PR:L).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to induce a user to interact with the malicious crafted URL containing the vulnerable parameter, while having low privileges on the application. The attack has high complexity (AC:H).
