Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a **Broken Access Control** issue. Specifically, there's a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function that allows an unprivileged user to execute higher-privileged actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Broken Access Control:** The core issue is the lack of proper access controls, allowing unauthorized actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An unprivileged user (specifically, a 'Contributor' role as indicated) can perform actions that should be reserved for users with higher privileges.
*   The specific impact is noted to vary case by case, but it generally involves the unauthorized execution of privileged actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a vulnerable function within the SiteOrigin Widgets Bundle plugin that fails to check user privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a user with at least the 'Contributor' role to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is classified as low severity, and is unlikely to be exploited.
* The fix is to update the plugin to version 1.64.1 or later.
* The vulnerability is related to the OWASP Top 10 A1: Broken Access Control.
