- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Hack-Info WordPress plugin, versions 3.17 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users (e.g. administrators) to execute unwanted actions. The specific impact depends on the vulnerable functionality within the plugin.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is carried out by crafting a malicious request and tricking an authenticated user into submitting it (e.g., via a link or embedded form).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into initiating a malicious request. This could be achieved via social engineering or by leveraging other vulnerabilities. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to initiate the attack, only a logged-in victim user.
