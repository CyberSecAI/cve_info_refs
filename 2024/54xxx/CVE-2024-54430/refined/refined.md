- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The EELV Newsletter plugin for WordPress lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies case by case, but could include actions like modifying plugin settings, adding users, or modifying content.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker exploits the lack of CSRF protection by crafting a malicious request and tricking an authenticated user into executing it (e.g. through a link or embedded image).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user with administrative privileges into clicking a malicious link, or otherwise tricking the user's browser into sending the crafted request to the vulnerable site. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
