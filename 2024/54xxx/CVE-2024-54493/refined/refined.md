- **Root cause:** The vulnerability lies in the Shortcuts application where microphone access privacy indicators may be incorrectly attributed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Incorrect state management leads to incorrect attribution of microphone privacy indicators.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The primary impact is that users may not be aware when their microphone is being accessed by the Shortcuts app due to incorrect privacy indicator attribution.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious app or shortcut script that improperly triggers microphone use.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A malicious application or shortcut with user approval to access the microphone, running on a vulnerable macOS system.
