Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-54104:

**CVE-2024-54104:** Cross-process screen stack vulnerability in the UIExtension module.

*   **Root Cause:** A vulnerability exists in the UIExtension module related to cross-process screen stack handling.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability is a "cross-process screen stack" issue. This likely involves improper management or synchronization of screen stack data across different processes.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could affect service confidentiality. This suggests an attacker could potentially access sensitive information related to the screen stack.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is in the UIExtension module and involves cross-process interaction. The specific attack vector is not described beyond this, but it implies an attacker would need to trigger the vulnerability via interaction across process boundaries.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker would need the ability to interact with the affected UIExtension module from a separate process, meaning that it is likely that a malicious application running on the device could leverage this vulnerability.

**Affected Versions:** HarmonyOS 5.0.0
