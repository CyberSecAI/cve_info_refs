Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. The Comment feature has implemented a filter to prevent users from adding restricted characters, such as HTML tags. However, this filter operates on the client-side, which can be bypassed, making the application vulnerable to HTML Injection. This vulerability is fixed in 10.13.4 and 11.2.0.
