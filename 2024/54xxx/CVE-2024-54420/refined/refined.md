- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Metrika Plugin <= 1.2 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions within the plugin. The specific impact varies depending on the plugin's functionality and the actions exposed to CSRF.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves tricking an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website that crafts a forged request to the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to lure an authenticated user into performing an action. This could be achieved by sending a malicious link or hosting a malicious website. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
