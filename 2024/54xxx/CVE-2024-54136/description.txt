ClipBucket V5 provides open source video hosting with PHP. ClipBucket-v5 Version 5.5.1 Revision 199 and below is vulnerable to PHP Deserialization vulnerability. The vulnerability exists in upload/upload.php where the user supplied input via collection get parameter is directly provided to unserialize function. As a result, it is possible for an adversary to inject maliciously crafted PHP serialized object and utilize gadget chains to cause unexpected behaviors of the application. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.5.1 Revision 200.
