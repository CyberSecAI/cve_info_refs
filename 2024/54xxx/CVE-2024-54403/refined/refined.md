- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Visual Recent Posts Plugin <= 1.2.3 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user inputs or outputs, leading to an XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads, into the website. These scripts would then be executed when users visit the site.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the plugin's functionality where user-supplied data is not properly sanitized.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
