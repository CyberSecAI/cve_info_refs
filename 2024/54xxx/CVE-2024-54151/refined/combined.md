# Unauthenticated access to WebSocket events and operations

High

[br41nslug](/br41nslug)
published
GHSA-849r-qrwj-8rv4
Dec 9, 2024

## Package

npm

directus
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>=11.0.0

## Patched versions

11.3.0

## Description

### Summary

When setting `WEBSOCKETS_GRAPHQL_AUTH` or `WEBSOCKETS_REST_AUTH` to "public", an unauthenticated user is able to do any of the supported operations (CRUD, subscriptions) with full admin privileges.

### Details

Accountability for unauthenticated WebSocket requests is set to null, which used to be "public permissions" until the Permissions Policy update which now defaults that to system/admin level access. So instead of null we need to make use of `createDefaultAccountability()` to ensure public permissions are used for unauthenticated users.

### PoC

1. Start directus with

```
WEBSOCKETS_ENABLED=true
WEBSOCKETS_GRAPHQL_AUTH=public
WEBSOCKETS_REST_AUTH=public
```

2. Subscribe using GQL or REST or do any CRUD operation on a user created collection (system tables are not reachable with crud)

```
subscription {
    directus_users_mutated {
        key
        event
        data {
            id
            email
            first_name
            last_name
            password
        }
    }
}
```

or

```
{
   "type": "items",
   "action": "read",
   "collection": "your_collection_name"
}
```

3a. Open up the data studio as any user. Observe how the subscriber gets notified on each page navigation (because the users `last_page` gets updated, the `password` fields is properly redacted here)

3b. Observe receiving all available items from the `your_collection_name` collection.

### Impact

This impacts any Directus instance that has either `WEBSOCKETS_GRAPHQL_AUTH` or `WEBSOCKETS_REST_AUTH` set to `public` allowing unauthenticated users to subscribe for changes on any collection or do REST CRUD operations on user defined collections ignoring permissions.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
