Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-54151:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from how Directus handles unauthenticated WebSocket connections when `WEBSOCKETS_GRAPHQL_AUTH` or `WEBSOCKETS_REST_AUTH` are set to "public". Instead of assigning public permissions to these unauthenticated users, the system defaulted to `null` accountability, which, due to a recent permissions policy update, equates to system/admin level access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect Default Permissions:** Unauthenticated WebSocket connections were not properly assigned public permissions, leading to unintended access levels.
- **Bypass of Access Controls:**  The vulnerability allows bypassing access controls, granting unauthorized users the ability to perform actions as if they were administrators.
- **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** As a result of the incorrect permissions, sensitive data, such as user details, could be accessed through subscriptions or CRUD operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full Admin Privileges:** Unauthenticated users gain the ability to execute any supported operations (CRUD, subscriptions) as if they were system administrators.
- **Data Exposure:** Unauthorized users can access sensitive data within the database via websockets.
- **CRUD Operations:** Unauthorized users can perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on user-defined collections, bypassing intended permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
- **WebSockets:** The attack is carried out through the WebSocket interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the Directus instance.

**Technical Details:**
- The fix involves changing how accountability is set for unauthenticated websocket requests. Instead of setting it to `null`, the fix uses `createDefaultAccountability()` which ensures that public permissions are used for unauthenticated users.
- The vulnerability is present in versions >= 11.0.0 of Directus.
- The fix is available in version 11.3.0.
- The vulnerability is present if  `WEBSOCKETS_GRAPHQL_AUTH` or `WEBSOCKETS_REST_AUTH` is set to `public`
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to subscribe for changes on any collection or do REST CRUD operations on user defined collections ignoring permissions.
