- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The SOPA Blackout plugin for WordPress lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force higher-privileged users to perform unintended actions while authenticated.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could craft a malicious request that, when triggered by a logged-in user, would execute the desired action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into triggering a malicious request. The attacker doesn't need any authentication to the vulnerable application.
