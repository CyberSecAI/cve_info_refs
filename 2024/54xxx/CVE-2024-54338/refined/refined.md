**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is not explicitly mentioned, but the description indicates the presence of a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the Hello Event Widgets For Elementor plugin. This implies that the plugin does not properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input, allowing malicious scripts to be injected.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the plugin.
- Unspecified input sanitization or encoding issues

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious actor can inject scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads, into the website.
- These injected scripts will execute when visitors access the website, potentially compromising user security.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts via user input that is not properly sanitized/encoded. The exact vulnerable field is not specified.
- Exploitation occurs when a user visits a page containing the injected script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires the ability to inject malicious code into the plugin's data or settings.
- The attacker likely needs to be at least a 'Contributor' level of access, as that is the required privilege for the vulnerability mentioned.
