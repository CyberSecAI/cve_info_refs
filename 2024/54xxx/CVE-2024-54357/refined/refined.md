Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The Avada theme for WordPress (versions <= 7.11.10) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **CSRF:** The theme lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks. This means that a malicious actor can potentially trick a logged-in user into performing actions on the website without their knowledge or consent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A successful CSRF attack could allow an attacker to force higher-privileged users (e.g., administrators) to execute unwanted actions on the WordPress site while they are authenticated. This may include changes to website settings, creation of malicious accounts or even complete website takeover.
*   The specific impact of the CSRF vulnerability can vary depending on the actions exposed and the privileges of the targeted user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is through malicious links or scripts that the attacker can lure the victim into clicking while they have an active session on the vulnerable WordPress website. This can be done through email, social media, or other websites.
*   The attacker has to get a logged-in, higher-privilege user to visit a malicious website or click on a malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated with the target website or application.
*   The attacker needs to be able to get the target user (with higher privileges) to click on a link or load a webpage containing a malicious request.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is considered "low" priority and severity with a CVSS score of 4.3, but the potential impact could be significant depending on the specific actions that are vulnerable.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 7.11.11 of the Avada theme.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Ananda Dhakal from Patchstack.
