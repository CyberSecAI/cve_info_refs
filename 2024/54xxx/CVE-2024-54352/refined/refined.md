- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Sogrid WordPress plugin, in versions 1.5.2 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). This means that the plugin doesn't properly validate that requests are coming from the user that intended to send them.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability. Lack of proper nonce implementation or other CSRF protections, allowing malicious actors to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions on their behalf by tricking them into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website. The specific actions are not mentioned and may vary depending on the functionality of the plugin.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a crafted request that is sent from the attacker to the target user. The target user must be authenticated to the target website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in, higher-privileged user into submitting a crafted request. This could be achieved through phishing attacks or by injecting malicious code into another website visited by the target user. The attacker does not need prior access to the WordPress instance.
