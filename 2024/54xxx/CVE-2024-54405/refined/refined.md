- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress ECT Social Share Plugin, version 1.3 and below, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to potentially execute unwanted actions on behalf of an authenticated user.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could force higher-privileged users to perform unintended actions, potentially leading to unauthorized changes, data manipulation, or other malicious activities within the WordPress site.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves tricking an authenticated user into submitting a malicious request without their knowledge, typically by embedding it in a link or on a malicious website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to lure a logged-in user to interact with a crafted request. This does not require access to the WordPress admin panel.
