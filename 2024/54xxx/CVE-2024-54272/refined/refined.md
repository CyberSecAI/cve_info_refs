**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The WordPress plugin "Radius Blocks â€“ WordPress Gutenberg Blocks" is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This means the plugin does not properly sanitize user-provided input before displaying it on a webpage.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Inadequate input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts (e.g., JavaScript) into a website through the plugin.
- The injected scripts can be executed when a user visits the compromised website.
- Potential impact includes:
    - Redirects to malicious websites.
    - Displaying unwanted advertisements.
    - Other HTML payload execution which could lead to stealing user data, account hijacking, etc.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious scripts through vulnerable input fields or parameters provided by the plugin.
- When a user interacts with the affected part of the website, the injected script executes within the user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject script code into areas where the Radius Blocks plugin renders output.
-  A user with "Contributor" privilege is sufficient to exploit the vulnerability
