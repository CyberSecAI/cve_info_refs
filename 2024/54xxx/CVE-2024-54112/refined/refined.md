- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a cross-process screen stack issue within the UIExtension module.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of screen stacks across different processes.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation may lead to a compromise of service confidentiality.
- **Attack vectors**: Cross-process communication mechanisms to manipulate the screen stack through the UIExtension module.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the capability to interact with the UIExtension module across process boundaries to exploit this vulnerability.
