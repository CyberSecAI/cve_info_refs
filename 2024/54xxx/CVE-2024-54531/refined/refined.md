- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A race condition was present in the Kernel.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows for a read-only memory mapping to be created that can be written to, bypassing memory protection mechanisms.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially bypass kASLR (kernel address space layout randomization), which is a security mechanism designed to randomize the memory layout of the kernel to make exploitation more difficult.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by an app.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to execute a malicious app on the system.
