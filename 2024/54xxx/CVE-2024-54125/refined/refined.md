Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-54125:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The "Shonen Jump+" app for Android failed to properly restrict access to a function that handles custom URL schemes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Restriction of Custom URL Schemes (CWE-939):** The app did not properly validate or restrict the URLs that could be accessed through its custom URL scheme handling mechanism. This allowed an attacker to potentially redirect the app to any website.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Website Access:** A remote attacker could force the app to navigate to any website of their choosing.
*   **Phishing Attacks:** This could be exploited to lead users to malicious websites designed to steal credentials or perform other malicious activities (phishing).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attacker could be remote from the victim.
*   **Custom URL Scheme Manipulation:** The attacker would need to craft a malicious custom URL scheme that, when processed by the vulnerable app, would redirect the user to the attacker's chosen site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs the ability to create custom URLs that would exploit the vulnerability in the app.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction to trigger the malicious URL.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affected versions of the "Shonen Jump+" app for Android prior to 4.0.0.
*   The vulnerability has been resolved in version 4.0.0 and later, which were released on March 28, 2024.
*   The application is automatically updated upon launch, so users should be protected if they have an updated version.
*   The official information specifies that there was no similar vulnerability in the iOS version of the app.
* The CVSS v3 score is 3.3 with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N which suggests local attack vector, low attack complexity, no privilege required, user interaction needed, unchanged scope, no confidentiality impact, low integrity impact and no availability impact
