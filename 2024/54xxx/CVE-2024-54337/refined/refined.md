- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress DX Dark Site plugin versions <= 1.0.1 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions while authenticated. This may lead to unintended changes in the site settings or other unauthorized actions, depending on the specific functionality of the plugin.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious web page that, when visited by an authenticated user, performs unwanted actions on the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into visiting a malicious web page to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker does not need any special privileges on the WordPress site; instead, they rely on the authentication of the user.
