- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Simple Queue Plugin does not escape the view name.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser session. This can lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, cookie theft, and defacement of web pages, potentially leading to complete compromise of the Jenkins instance and its users.
- **Attack vectors:**  An attacker with View/Create permission can inject malicious JavaScript code into the view name through the Simple Queue Plugin. When another user views the queue with the maliciously crafted name, the injected JavaScript will be executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires View/Create permission to exploit this vulnerability. They must be able to create or edit a view within the Simple Queue plugin. They also require the victim to view the created or edited view.
