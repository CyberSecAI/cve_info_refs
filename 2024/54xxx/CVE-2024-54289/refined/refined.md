Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a "Broken Access Control" issue within the Awesome Support plugin for WordPress. This means that there is a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, allowing unprivileged users to execute actions that should require higher privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The core issue is the lack of proper access control mechanisms, allowing unauthorized actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The specific impact is not detailed, but the general nature of a broken access control vulnerability can lead to a wide range of issues. This could include unauthorized data access, modification, or even complete takeover of the system depending on the specific function affected.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through a function within the Awesome Support plugin that lacks proper access control checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a "Subscriber," which is a low-privilege user role in WordPress. This means that an attacker does not need to have elevated privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
