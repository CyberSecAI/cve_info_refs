```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Improper input sanitization of the COMPONENT_fields(htmlTitle) field in the graphicCustomization.do page.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- Impact of exploitation: Remote attackers (authenticated as system administrators) can inject arbitrary web script or HTML, which is then rendered on other pages of the application for all users if the graphical customization is activated.
- Attack vectors: An authenticated system administrator injects malicious code into the vulnerable field via a crafted request to the `graphicCustomization.do` page.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be authenticated as a system administrator. Additionally, a super-administrator needs to have activated the graphical customization for the injected code to be rendered for other users.
