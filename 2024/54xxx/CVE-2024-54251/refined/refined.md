Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a **broken access control** issue within the WordPress Prodigy Commerce plugin. This means that a function or feature lacks proper authorization checks, allowing users with insufficient privileges to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-level users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing authorization checks:** The plugin fails to properly verify user permissions before allowing them to perform specific actions. This lack of verification is the core weakness.
*   **Broken Access Control:** Specifically, the vulnerability is categorized as "Broken Access Control," indicating that the system's access control mechanisms are flawed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The impact is described as having a **low severity** and is **unlikely to be exploited**, although specific impact details are not given in the content. The general description of broken access control notes that impact can vary case by case.
*   An unprivileged user could potentially execute higher privileged actions they are not intended to.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The specific attack vector isn't detailed, however, it is implied that the vector is a function lacking proper checks.
*   It is assumed that an attacker would exploit the lack of access control through the vulnerable functions, which would likely involve sending malicious requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be at least a **Contributor** level user to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker must be able to interact with the vulnerable function.
