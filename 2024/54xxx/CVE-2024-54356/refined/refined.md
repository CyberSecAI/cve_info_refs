- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Online Booking & Scheduling Calendar for WordPress by vcita plugin, versions 4.5 and below, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks. This allows an attacker to potentially force higher-privileged users to perform unintended actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to make authenticated users execute unwanted actions, which could result in unauthorized changes or data manipulation. The specific impact depends on the actions available to the targeted user role.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through CSRF. An attacker would need to craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into submitting it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious site that triggers the crafted request. No specific prior authentication is required.
