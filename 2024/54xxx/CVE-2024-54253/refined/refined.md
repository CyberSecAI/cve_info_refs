- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Xpro Elementor Addons plugin for WordPress, in versions 1.4.6.4 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts (such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads) into the website. These scripts will be executed when guests visit the site.
- **Attack vectors**: Malicious scripts are injected into the website through an unspecified method in the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious scripts into the website. The required privilege for exploitation is a contributor role.
