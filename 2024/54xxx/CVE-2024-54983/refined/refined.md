{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Quectel BC95-CNV chipset has a vulnerability in the baseband logic implementation, which receives messages with NAS message security header type â€œIntegrity protected and ciphered with new EPS security context" and the NULL message integrity authentication code (mac=0x0).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper message authentication",
      "Missing integrity check"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass message security authentication and arbitrarily manipulate message content by injecting attack messages without the correct security key.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Software-defined radio (USRP B210)",
      "Downlink NAS Transport message with specific security header and MAC values."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to transmit crafted radio signals to the NB-IoT device using software-defined radio and have knowledge of the required security header and MAC values to exploit the vulnerability. They also need to be in radio range of the vulnerable device."
