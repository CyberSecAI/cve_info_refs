Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a "Broken Access Control" issue within the Pinpoint Booking System plugin for WordPress. This indicates that there are insufficient checks in place to verify if a user is authorized to perform certain actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is a lack of proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in the plugin's code. This allows unprivileged users (specifically mentioned as "Subscriber") to execute higher-privileged actions that they should not have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact is described as "moderately dangerous" and "expected to become exploited". The provided text does not specify the precise actions that unprivileged users could perform, but based on the general description, it could include modifying booking settings, accessing or modifying other user data or anything that requires higher access level than subscriber.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the plugin itself, by exploiting the missing access control checks. An attacker would need to interact with the vulnerable functions in the plugin via HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker only needs to have a "Subscriber" level account on the WordPress site. The vulnerability can be exploited by any user who has a basic level of access. No higher privileges or special network positions are mentioned.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.3, classified as "Medium".
- There is no official fix available for this vulnerability.
- Patchstack has issued a virtual patch to mitigate the issue until an official fix is available.
- The vulnerability was reported by Muhammad Daffa.
