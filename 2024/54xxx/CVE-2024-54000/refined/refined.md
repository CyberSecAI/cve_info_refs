{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the use of `requests.get()` with `allow_redirects=True` in the `_check_url` method. This allows the server to follow HTTP redirects, potentially to attacker-controlled URLs.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) due to uncontrolled redirects"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause the server to make connections to internal-only services within the organization's infrastructure by redirecting the request to internal IPs.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker can manipulate the response of the initial URL request to include a 302 redirect to an internal resource.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control a domain that is being checked, so that it returns a 302 redirect."
