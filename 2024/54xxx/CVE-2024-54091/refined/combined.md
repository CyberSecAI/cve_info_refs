Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

SSA-979056: Out of Bounds Write Vulnerability in Parasolid

| Publication Date: | 2024-12-10 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2024-12-12 |
| Current Version: | V1.1 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 7.8 |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score: | 7.3 |

SUMMARY

Parasolid is affected by an out of bounds write vulnerability that could be triggered when the application is parsing X\_T data or a specially crafted file in X\_T format. If a user is tricked to open a malicious file with the affected applications, an attacker could leverage the vulnerability to perform remote code execution in the context of the current process.

Siemens has released new versions for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2024-54091

The affected application contains an out of bounds write past the end of an allocated buffer while parsing X\_T data or a specially crafted file in X\_T format.
This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.
