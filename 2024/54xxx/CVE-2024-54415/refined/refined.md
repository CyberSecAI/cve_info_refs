- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress WP-HideThat plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions while they are authenticated. This could result in unauthorized changes or actions on the website.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can craft malicious links or embed forms in external websites or emails, which will be executed by the victim upon clicking, if the victim is already authenticated on the target website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs no authentication but must trick a logged-in user to trigger the malicious request.
