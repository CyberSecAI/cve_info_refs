**Vulnerability Details:**
*   **Vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (Reflected XSS)
*   **CWE:** CWE-79
*  **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution
*   **Severity:** Important
*   **CVSS Score:** 6.1
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
*   **Attack Vector:** Network
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker does not need any privileges, but requires user interaction

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input within the application, leading to reflected cross-site scripting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present:** The application is susceptible to reflected XSS, which allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the victim's browser, enabling malicious actions such as stealing cookies, session tokens, or redirecting the user to malicious websites.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, where a malicious URL or injected code through a vulnerable parameter can trigger the vulnerability when a user interacts with it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs no prior authentication and is able to craft malicious links and trick users into clicking them to trigger the reflected XSS.
