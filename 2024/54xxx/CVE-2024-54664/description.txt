An issue was discovered in Veritas NetBackup before 10.5. This only applies to NetBackup components running on a Windows Operating System. If a user executes specific NetBackup commands or an attacker uses social engineering techniques to impel the user to execute the commands, a malicious DLL could be loaded, resulting in execution of the attacker's code in the user's security context, a different vulnerability than CVE-2024-52945.
