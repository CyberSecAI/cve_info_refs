SSA-730188: Multiple File Parsing Vulnerabilities in Solid Edge V2024

| Publication Date: | 2024-12-10 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2024-12-10 |
| Current Version: | V1.0 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 7.8 |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score: | 7.3 |

SUMMARY

Siemens Solid Edge is affected by multiple file parsing vulnerabilities that could be triggered when the application reads malicious PAR or ASM files. If a user is tricked to open a malicious file with the affected products, this could lead the application to crash or potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

Siemens has released a new version for Solid Edge SE2024 and recommends to update to the latest version.

WORKAROUNDS

AND
MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:

* CVE-2024-54093: Do not open untrusted ASM files in the affected applications
* CVE-2024-54094, CVE-2024-54095: Do not open untrusted PAR files in the affected applications

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section
[Affected Products and Solution](#affected-products-section).

Please follow the [General Security Recommendations](#general-recommendations).

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2024-54093

The affected application is vulnerable to heap-based buffer overflow while parsing specially crafted ASM files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.

| CWE | CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow |

Vulnerability CVE-2024-54094

The affected application is vulnerable to heap-based buffer overflow while parsing specially crafted PAR files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 7.8 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H |

| CWE | CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow |

Vulnerability CVE-2024-54095

The affected application is vulnerable to integer underflow vulnerability which can be triggered while parsing specially crafted PAR files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 7.8 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS v3.1 Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H |
