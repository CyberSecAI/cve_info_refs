- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Mail Picker plugin (versions <= 1.0.14) is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: PHP Object Injection. This vulnerability arises when user-supplied input is unserialized by the PHP `unserialize()` function without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to instantiate arbitrary PHP objects.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to code injection, SQL injection, path traversal, denial of service, and other attacks, depending on the available POP (Property-Oriented Programming) chains within the application.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through user-supplied input that is processed by the vulnerable `unserialize()` function. This input likely is some form of POST request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
