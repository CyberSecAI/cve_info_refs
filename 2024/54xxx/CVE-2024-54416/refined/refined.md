- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Wp Login with Ajax plugin (versions <= 0.6) lacks proper Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin is vulnerable to CSRF.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions, taking advantage of the user's existing authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker would need to craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into triggering it. This can be done by various means, such as a phishing email or a malicious website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need prior authentication but must be able to convince a logged-in user to trigger the malicious request.
