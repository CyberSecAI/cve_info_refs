**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is the presence of a Local File Inclusion vulnerability. This type of vulnerability occurs when an application allows a user to control a file path used in file-related operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **File Access:** A malicious actor can potentially include local files of the target website.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The output of these included files can be displayed on the screen, potentially exposing sensitive information.

*   **Database Takeover:** If database credentials are leaked, it could lead to a complete takeover of the database depending on the configuration.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the Local File Inclusion vulnerability. The attacker can manipulate the application to include files from the local file system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the plugin to include local files.
*   The attacker requires at least "Contributor" privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
