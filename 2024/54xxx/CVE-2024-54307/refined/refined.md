  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions while authenticated.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is launched via a crafted request originating from a malicious website or email. It relies on an authenticated user visiting this malicious content while being logged into the affected WordPress site.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious requests, which is generally trivial and host the malicious content on an external server. The attacker needs no prior access or authentication."
