- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to perform actions on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies case by case, but could include unauthorized changes to site settings or other administrative functions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can craft a malicious request that is triggered by an authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user to initiate a crafted request, such as by tricking them into clicking a link or visiting a malicious site. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
