Inferno Nettverk A/S Security Advisory
Package: Dante
Advisory Id: DNTE-20050128002
CVE: CVE-2024-54662
Date: 2024-11-16 (private, customers only)
Date: 2024-12-16 (public)
Affected versions: Dante server 1.4.0, 1.4.1, 1.4.2, and 1.4.3
----------------------------------------------------------------------
To users and customers of Inferno Nettverk A/S using Dante:
A security issue related to a rarely used option in the Dante server's
client/hostid-rules was recently reported to us by a private party.
The issue can in some circumstances lead to a client that should have
been blocked by the Dante rules/ACLs, to instead be permitted.
The issue only affects Dante configurations where the option
"socksmethod" is set within a client/hostid-rule.
This advisory affects:
Versions 1.4.0 through 1.4.3 of the Dante server, but only if
"socksmethod" is set within a client/hostid-rule, and only if
subsequent socks-rules would not block the client in question.
An example of a possibly affected configuration is a sockd.conf
containing a client or hostid-rule such as this:
"""
client pass {
...
socksmethod: none
}
"""
Under certain circumstances, and depending on how the subsequent
socks-rules look, a client that should have been blocked by the Dante
rules/ACLs may instead be permitted.
This advisory does not affect:
Customers that do not set "socksmethod" within client- or hostid-rules.
Setting "socksmethod" within socks-rules, as is the common way, is
not affected. E.g., the following rule does not cause problems:
"""
socks pass {
...
socksmethod: ...
}
"""
If none of the client-rules or hostid-rules (that is, rules starting
with "client pass" or "hostid pass") contain the keyword "socksmethod",
this issue does not affect your configuration and no changes are
required.
Recommended steps for customers:
If you believe you may be affected by this, we ask you to provide us
with a copy of your sockd.conf so we can verify whether your sockd.conf
is affected by this. If it is, we would like to help you devise a
work-around until a new release of Dante is available.
We can alternatively provide you a patch for this problem if so
required.
Recommended steps for others:
If you believe you may be affected by this, we suggest you
update to Dante version 1.4.4.
Presumed impact:
We expect most configurations to be unaffected by this issue, because
setting "socksmethod" within client or hostid-rules is a rarely used
feature that is not required in normal/common usage scenarios.
In the configurations that are affected however, a client that should
have been blocked by Dante's ACL rules may instead be permitted.
Technical details:
N/A.
Acknowledgments:
The issue was privately reported to us by Igor Medovolkin
(igor.aka.igro@gmail.com.example.com), and we do not believe it to
have been public knowledge before the release of this advisory.
We thank Mr. Medovolkin for the responsible disclosure of this issue.
Should you have any questions about this issue, please contact your
Inferno Nettverk support contact in the usual way. If you do not have
a support contact, please use the public dante-misc mailinglist.
Please see https://www.inet.no/dante/lists.html for more information

With kind regards, Inferno Nettverk Support

|  |  | Dante - A free SOCKS server Dante is a product developed by Inferno Nettverk A/S. It consists of a SOCKS *server* and a SOCKS *client,* implementing RFC 1928 and related standards. It is a flexible product that can be used to provide convenient and secure network connectivity.  Inferno Nettverk A/S provides commercial services related to Dante, including 24/7 phone support, customized installations/tuning, development, porting and embedding. For more information about support, please see the Dante [support page](support.html).  Once installed, Dante can in most cases be made transparent to clients, providing functionality somewhat similar to what could be described as a non-transparent Layer 4 router. For customers interested in controlling and monitoring access in or out of their network, the Dante SOCKS server can provide several benefits, including security and TCP/IP termination (no direct contact between hosts inside and outside of the customer network), resource control (bandwidth, sessions), and logging (host information, data transferred).  The Dante SOCKS server interoperates with many popular network applications which already have SOCKS support built in to them, such as most web-browsers, instant messaging programs, Bloomberg terminals, and many others.  Developed by Inferno Nettverk A/S, Dante is released under a BSD/CMU-type [license](LICENSE) and comes with complete source code.  Dante is used daily by Fortune 100 companies and large international organizations, both as a standard (forward) proxy server and as a reverse proxy server.  Configuration and setup of Dante is described in the [configuration pages](/dante/doc/latest/config/index.html).  Several commercial modules are available for the Dante server. For more information see the [module page](module.html). Dante Development Roadmap Current development roadmap for Dante (updated **December 2024**).

|  |  | Dante - Binary downloads Binary versions of Dante for a select set of platforms are made available on this page. Binary generation procedure Checksums are listed for each archive and it is recommended that these are verified after download.  The binaries are not built statically; some of the binaries might require additional software (such as libssl/gssapi) to be installed. Binary variants Some Dante parameters can only be set at compile time. To cover different usage scenarios multiple binary variants are made available:   * **Prod** - This variant will likely be correct for   most usage scenarios. It has been compiled for production usage and   supports the GSSAPI authentication method.* **Highio** - This is a variant with reduced     functionality for environments with many sessions that has been     build with some functionality disabled in order to lower the     resource usage of Dante. Currently, the only difference between     the *Prod* variant and *Highio* is that GSSAPI     authentication has been disabled, using the *--without-gssapi*     configure option.* **Fullprod** - This is a variation of *prod*       that has been compiled with external dependencies. This is       currently tcpwrappers (libwrap)       and [MiniUPnP](http://miniupnp.free.fr/) (libminiupnpc).   With the exception of the *Fullprod* variant, all binaries are built with minimal reliance on external packages/libraries supported by Dante. This currently means that *configure* is run with the options listed below during binary generation.   * --without-upnp (UPnP support disabled)* --without-libwrap (libwrap support disabled)  Modules Modules can currently not be used with these binaries. Please contact Inferno Nettverk A/S if you require binaries with module support. Dante 1.4.x releases Currently, .tar.gz archives with pre-compiled binaries are available. Platform-specific packages (RPM-files etc.) are currently not available, but will likely be made available for later versions.  *Please note that as of Dante 1.4.3, the pre-compiled binaries on this page are no longer updated. Instead, binaries are now generated upon request for customers with Extended or Full Support contracts.* Dante 1.4.3 Currently available to Extended and Full Support customers upon request. Please contact us via the support email address to request the needed binaries, including information about the platform and version.
