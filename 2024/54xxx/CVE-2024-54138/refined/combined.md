# XSS Vulnerability in NuGetGallery's Markdown Autolinks Processing

Low

[lyndaidaii](/lyndaidaii)
published
GHSA-x448-p234-x5p8
Dec 6, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<= v2024.05.28

## Patched versions

V2024.12.06

## Description

### Impact

The NuGetGallery has a security vulnerability related to its handling of autolinks in Markdown content. While the platform properly filters out JavaScript from standard links, it does not adequately sanitize autolinks. This oversight allows attackers to exploit autolinks as a vector for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

For example, when a user inputs a Markdown autolink with an encoded JavaScript payload, such as:

`<javascript:%61%6C%65%72%74%28%31%29>`

the link is rendered without proper sanitization. When clicked, the browser decodes the payload and executes the JavaScript code, resulting in the same XSS attack as with the plain-text payload.
