# Downloading malicious GitHub Actions workflow artifact results in path traversal vulnerability

Low

[jtmcg](/jtmcg)
published
GHSA-2m9h-r57g-45pj
Dec 3, 2024

## Package

gomod

github.com/cli/cli/v2
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<= 2.63.0

## Patched versions

2.63.1

## Description

### Summary

A security vulnerability has been identified in GitHub CLI that could create or overwrite files in unintended directories when users download a malicious GitHub Actions workflow artifact through `gh run download`.

### Details

This vulnerability stems from a GitHub Actions workflow artifact named `..` when downloaded using `gh run download`. The artifact name and `--dir` flag are used to determine the artifact’s download path. When the artifact is named `..`, the resulting files within the artifact are extracted exactly 1 directory higher than the specified `--dir` flag value.

In `2.63.1`, `gh run download` will not download artifacts named `..` and `.` and instead exit with the following error message:

```
error downloading ..: would result in path traversal

```
### Impact

Successful exploitation heightens the risk of local path traversal attack vectors exactly 1 directory higher than intended.

### Remediation and Mitigation

1. Upgrade `gh` to `2.63.1`
2. Implement additional validation to ensure artifact filenames do not contain potentially dangerous patterns, such as `..`, to prevent path traversal risks.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-54132

### Weaknesses

[CWE-22](/advisories?query=cwe%3A22)
