- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Backdrop CMS does not sufficiently sanitize SVG images when they are embedded into content.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the content of the website, potentially leading to various attacks, including stealing user sessions, redirecting users to malicious websites, or defacing the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability occurs when SVG images are embedded into content. An attacker needs to have a role with sufficient permission to access the format and upload images. The SVG tag must also be in the list of allowed tags for a text format.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a user role with permission to access a text format that allows SVG tags, and permission to upload images.
