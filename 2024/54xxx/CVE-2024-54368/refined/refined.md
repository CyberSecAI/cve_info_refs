  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The WordPress GitSync plugin, version 1.1.0 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor could force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious actor could craft a request that is triggered when a logged-in user visits a malicious site or interacts with malicious content. This request would cause the authenticated user's browser to make a request to the vulnerable WordPress site, performing unintended actions without the user's knowledge or consent.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They need to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges to visit a malicious site or interact with malicious content."
