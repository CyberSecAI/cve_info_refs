# Correctness error in HQC decapsulation

High

[dstebila](/dstebila)
published
GHSA-gpf4-vrrw-r8v7
Dec 6, 2024

## Package

liboqs

## Affected versions

<0.12.0

## Patched versions

0.12.0 and higher

## Description

liboqs is a C-language cryptographic library that provides implementations of post-quantum cryptography algorithms.

## Impact

A correctness error has been identified in the reference implementation of the HQC key encapsulation mechanism. Due to an indexing error, part of the secret key is incorrectly treated as non-secret data. This results in an incorrect shared secret value being returned when the decapsulation function is called with a malformed ciphertext.

No concrete attack exploiting the error has been identified at this point. However, the error involves mishandling of the secret key, and in principle this presents a security vulnerability.

## Patches

Fixed in version 0.12.0 and main branch of liboqs on GitHub.

* [cce1bfd](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/commit/cce1bfde4e52c524b087b9687020d283fbde0f24)

We have reported the error to the maintainers of the [HQC reference implementation](https://pqc-hqc.org/index.html).

## Further details

In the 2023/04/30 version of the HQC specification and reference implementation, an extra field (`sigma`) was added to the secret key structure to enable implicit rejection of malformed ciphertexts. The logic to retrieve the public key from the secret key in the decapsulation function was not updated accordingly. As a result, `sigma` is treated as part of the public key. Later in the decapsulation call, a incorrectly constructed comparison check allows this error to go through undetected. Due to how these two bugs interfere with each other, the decapsulation function never uses `sigma` to perform implicit rejection; instead, it accepts malformed ciphertexts and returns shared secrets based on their decryptions.

## Credits

The vulnerability was identified by Célian Glénaz and Dahmun Goudarzi (Quarkslab).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
