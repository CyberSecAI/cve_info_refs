- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The News Kit Elementor Addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This means that the plugin does not properly sanitize user input or data before displaying it on a webpage.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization, which allows attackers to inject malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow a malicious actor to inject malicious scripts such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into your website. These scripts will be executed when users visit the compromised site. This could lead to various malicious activities, including data theft, session hijacking, and drive-by downloads.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the plugin, where a malicious actor can inject malicious scripts via the plugin's vulnerable input fields. The attacker would need to find a way to inject the payload, which may or may not require user interaction or authenticated access, depending on the specific implementation of the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires the ability to inject the malicious script, which is likely through a vulnerable input field of the plugin. The required privilege is at least contributor level.
