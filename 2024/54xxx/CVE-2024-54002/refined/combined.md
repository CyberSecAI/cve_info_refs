# Enumeration of managed users via /api/v1/user/login endpoint

Moderate

[nscuro](/nscuro)
published
GHSA-9w3m-hm36-w32w
Dec 4, 2024

## Package

maven

org.dependencytrack:dependency-track
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

< 4.12.2

## Patched versions

4.12.2

## Description

### Description

Performing a login request against the `/api/v1/user/login` endpoint with a username that exist in the system takes significantly longer than performing the same action with a username that is not known by the system.

### Impact

The observable difference in request duration can be leveraged by actors to enumerate valid names of *managed* users. LDAP and OpenID Connect users are not affected.

### Patches

The issue has been fixed in Dependency-Track 4.12.2.

### Workarounds

Failed login attempts are logged, for example:

```
Unauthorized login attempt / invalid credentials / username: admin / IP Address: [0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1] / User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:132.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/132.0

```

A solution like [fail2ban](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban) may be used to block clients that produce many such events.

If logs are shipped to a centralized log aggregator, the same pattern may be used to issue alerts.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
