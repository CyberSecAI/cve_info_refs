- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Multiple Admin Emails plugin version 1.0 and earlier is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force a logged-in administrator to perform unintended actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in administrator into executing it, for example, through a link or by embedding it in a webpage.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into submitting the malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress site.
