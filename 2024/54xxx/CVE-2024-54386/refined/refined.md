- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Push Monkey Pro plugin, versions 3.9 and below, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to potentially force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could lead to an attacker forcing a logged-in administrator to perform actions they did not intend to make. The exact impact would vary depending on the actions available within the plugin.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a malicious webpage or email containing a crafted request to the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated but needs to entice a logged-in privileged user (admin) to unknowingly submit the crafted request.
