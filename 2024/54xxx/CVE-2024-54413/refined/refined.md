- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Display Future Posts plugin (versions <= 0.2.3) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to potentially force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could enable a malicious actor to force an authenticated user to execute actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is launched by tricking an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious site that will then make requests to the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by tricking a logged-in user into performing an action.
