- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WP-Ban-User plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker exploits the lack of CSRF protection to trick an authenticated user into performing actions they did not intend, such as modifying the plugin settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website. The attacker does not need prior authentication to the target WordPress site.
