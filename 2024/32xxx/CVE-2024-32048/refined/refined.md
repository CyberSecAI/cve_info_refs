- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the OpenVINOâ„¢ Model Server software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The software lacks proper input validation which allows for an attacker to send malicious input leading to a denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered through adjacent network access, meaning that the attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be adjacent to the vulnerable system on the network and does not need to authenticate.
