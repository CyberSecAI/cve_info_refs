- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple relative path traversal vulnerabilities in FortiManager, FortiAnalyzer & FortiAnalyzer-BigData.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path Traversal (CWE-23).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A privileged attacker can delete files from the underlying filesystem via crafted CLI requests. This can lead to a denial of service by removing critical system files and potentially other unauthorized actions depending on the permissions of the user and the files they can reach.
- **Attack vectors:** Crafted CLI requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A privileged attacker is required. They need to have access to the CLI interface of the affected systems.
