* click settings -> llm -> openai
* fill the OpenAI API Key you like
* fill the proxy address that you want to attack (e.g. a domain that resolved to a local ip addr like 127.0.0.1.xip.io) (the address will concat the path "/chat/completions" which can be bypassed with sharp like "[http://172.23.0.1:8000/#](http://172.23.0.1:8000/)")
* then lobe will echo the ssrf result below :)

The jwt token header X-Lobe-Chat-Auth strored proxy address and OpenAI API Key, you can modify it to scan internal network in your target lobe-web.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L
