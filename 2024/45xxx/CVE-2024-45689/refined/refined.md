Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of capability checks in Moodle's dynamic tables.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** Dynamic tables in Moodle did not enforce proper permission checks, allowing users to potentially bypass access restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Information Disclosure:** Attackers could retrieve sensitive information that they were not authorized to access by exploiting the lack of capability checks on dynamic tables.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Access to Dynamic Tables:** By interacting with the vulnerable dynamic tables, an attacker could potentially extract unauthorized data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Moodle User Account:** The attacker needs to be a user with a valid account on the Moodle platform. They do not need elevated privileges.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Tables:** The attacker needs to know how to access or manipulate the dynamic tables to exploit the vulnerability.
