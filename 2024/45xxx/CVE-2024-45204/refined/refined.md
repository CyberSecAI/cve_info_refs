The provided content is related to CVE-2024-45204.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
Insufficient permissions in credential handling.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability stems from inadequate permission controls in how credentials are handled within Veeam Backup & Replication.
- An authenticated user with a specific assigned role can exploit this weakness.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Potential leakage of NTLM hashes of saved credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack, requiring access to the Veeam Backup & Replication server.
- Exploitation requires an authenticated user with a role assigned in the "Users and Roles" settings of the backup server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have a valid user account with at least some assigned role within the Veeam Backup & Replication environment, as configured under the "Users and Roles" settings.
- They do not require administrative access, a lower level permission is sufficient.
