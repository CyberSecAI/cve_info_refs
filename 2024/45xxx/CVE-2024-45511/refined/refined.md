{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization by the OnlyOffice formatter when rendering content within the Briefcase module.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious payload and including it in a file processed by the OnlyOffice formatter within the Briefcase module. The user must then interact with the specially crafted content. The payload is triggered when the content is rendered by the vulnerable component.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to upload a file containing the malicious payload to a Zimbra server, specifically within the Briefcase module, and the targeted user must then view/interact with this file. No authentication bypass is required, assuming that the attacker can utilize a valid account or compromise one to upload the malicious file."
