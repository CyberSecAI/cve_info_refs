- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper authentication of an HTTP endpoint in the S3 Gateway.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The S3 Gateway endpoint allows any authenticated Kerberos user to revoke and regenerate the S3 secrets of any other user due to missing or inadequate authentication checks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can revoke and regenerate S3 secrets of other users, potentially leading to unauthorized access to S3 resources or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending HTTP requests to the specific endpoint in the S3 Gateway of Apache Ozone.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated Kerberos user and the following configurations must be enabled:
    - `ozone.s3g.secret.http.enabled` is set to true.
    -  The user configured in `ozone.s3g.kerberos.principal` is also configured in `ozone.s3.administrators` or `ozone.administrators`.
