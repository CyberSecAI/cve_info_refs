Subject: CVE-2024-45784: Apache Airflow: Sensitive configuration values are
 not masked in the logs by default

Severity: moderate

Affected versions:

- Apache Airflow before 2.10.3

Description:

Apache Airflow versions before 2.10.3 contain a vulnerability that could expose sensitive configuration variables in task logs. This vulnerability allows DAG authors to unintentionally or intentionally log sensitive configuration variables. Unauthorized users could access these logs, potentially exposing critical data that could be exploited to compromise the security of the Airflow deployment. In version 2.10.3, secrets are now masked in task logs to prevent sensitive configuration variables from being exposed in the logging output. Users should upgrade to Airflow 2.10.3 or the latest version to eliminate this vulnerability. If you suspect that DAG authors could have logged the secret values to the logs and that your logs are not additionally protected, it is also recommended that you update those secrets.

Some configurations are irrelevant to DAG authors and hence we need to mask those to avoid it from getting logged unknowingly.

| I see some discussions around, does anyone have any suggestions for this? I use Pycharm  I believe (I have not yet had time to look at it) this requires to use `uv workspace` and the latest `uv` installed - [@ashb](https://github.com/ashb) - are there any instructions for that already somewhere ?

| Breeze is all set up yes. UV workspace isn't 100% required yet (though I don't think anyone tested running tests from inside pycharm), but for pycharm to find imports you need to set up some paths as the right kind of folder in the UI  I'm not a pycharm user, but [@kaxil](https://github.com/kaxil) [@dstandish](https://github.com/dstandish) can provide some insight. |

| [#42951](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/42951) should help Pycharm too. Remaining "manual" steps as pycharm user are:   1. We marked `providers/src` as Source Folder and `providers/src/airflow` as Namespace package. 2. Verify that there is nothing on old provider path: `rm -rf airflow/providers` 🙂 3. Trigger Rescan Project Indexes from **File** -> **Repair IDE**. |

'AIRFLOW_CTX_DAG_RUN_ID': 'manual__2024-10-16T13:09:12.855444+00:00'})  ```  From my original list, these aren't masked:  ```     "AIRFLOW__SMTP__SMTP_PORT",     "AIRFLOW__SMTP__SMTP_PASSWORD",     "AIRFLOW__SMTP__SMTP_PASSWORD_SECRET",     "AIRFLOW__SMTP__SMTP_USER",     "AIRFLOW__SMTP__SMTP_SSL",     "AIRFLOW__SMTP__SMTP_HOST",     "AIRFLOW__SENTRY__SENTRY_DSN_SECRET",     "AIRFLOW__DATABASE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN_SECRET",     "AIRFLOW__DATABASE__SQL_ALCHEMY_ENGINE_ARGS_SECRET",     "AIRFLOW__CORE__DATASET_MANAGER_KWARGS_SECRET",     "AIRFLOW__LOGGING__REMOTE_TASK_HANDLER_KWARGS_SECRET",  ```  As per the comments above, looks like `AIRFLOW__SMTP__SMTP_PORT`, `AIRFLOW__SMTP__SMTP_USER` (removed), `AIRFLOW__SMTP__SMTP_PASSWORD` (removed), arent relevant.  I think:   * AIRFLOW\_\_SMTP\_\_SMTP\_USER * AIRFLOW\_\_SMTP\_\_SMTP\_SSL * AIRFLOW\_\_SMTP\_\_SMTP\_HOST   Are ok to be unmasked. That leaves us with:  ```     "AIRFLOW__SENTRY__SENTRY_DSN_SECRET",     "AIRFLOW__DATABASE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN_SECRET",     "AIRFLOW__DATABASE__SQL_ALCHEMY_ENGINE_ARGS_SECRET",     "AIRFLOW__CORE__DATASET_MANAGER_KWARGS_SECRET",     "AIRFLOW__LOGGING__REMOTE_TASK_HANDLER_KWARGS_SECRET",  ```  Should these be masked or its alright to keep them unmasked? |

Line: <https://github.com/amoghrajesh/airflow/blob/840ea3efb9533837e9f36b75fa527a0fbafeb23a/airflow/configuration.py#L121>  Not really [@saurabhb-dev](https://github.com/saurabhb-dev) , It's even better to mask values in this case, rather than keys.  The secrets\_masker works in two modes:   * for known structures it can mask sensitive key values (for example if a key in connection is "password" - it will mask the value when it prints the structure (when it is aware of the structure and acts on it) * but this is impossible when you log messages when the structures or values have been already converted to log string - by the time secrets masker in logger (installed as filter) gets the message, the structure is gone already (converted to string representation) and we are not aware that particular key corresponds to particular value. So our secrets masker has the second mode - where it can mask specific values. It will scan the string for all the values that are registered upfront and mask them if it finds any of them in the string.   This is what happens here - we retrieve all the secret config values (whether they come by env vars or by other means) and we add values (i.e. actual secrets) to be masked. This way when any secret is printed anywhere where secrets\_masker is used, it will automatically mask it - regardless if it is a structure (secrets\_masker checks values of dicts for example) or whether it's already converted to string. |

| i think i know what's going on here. somehow [7dea23f](https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/7dea23fd23fa347143fded6979879cf5f58fa132) ([#42126](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/42126)) didn't make the cut for 2.10.3, which caused the `self.sensitive_config_values` to return both `('database', 'sql_alchemy_conn')` and `('core', 'sql_alchemy_conn')` |
