- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `ctl_persistent_reserve_out` command in the ctl subsystem allows the caller to specify an arbitrary size which is passed to the kernel's memory allocator without proper validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unbounded memory allocation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious guest can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) on the host by triggering excessive memory allocation.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious guest operating within a virtualized environment using `virtio_scsi(4)` or through an iSCSI target daemon (`ctld(8)`) can send a crafted `ctl_persistent_reserve_out` command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a malicious guest within a virtualized environment using `virtio_scsi(4)` or have the ability to interact with the iSCSI target daemon (`ctld(8)`).

The advisory provides more specific details than a generic CVE description, detailing the vulnerable command, affected subsystems, and the specific conditions required for exploitation.
