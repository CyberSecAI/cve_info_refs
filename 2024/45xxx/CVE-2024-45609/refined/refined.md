- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the reports pages of GLPI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected XSS (CWE-80).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the reports page, which would then be executed in the context of the technician's browser session. This could lead to various attacks, including session hijacking, information theft, or defacement of the GLPI interface, though the provided CVSS score indicates no impact on integrity or availability. The Confidentiality impact is marked as high
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is carried out via a malicious link crafted by the attacker and sent to a GLPI technician. When the technician clicks the link, the injected script is executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link and trick a GLPI technician into clicking it. The attacker does not require any authentication.
