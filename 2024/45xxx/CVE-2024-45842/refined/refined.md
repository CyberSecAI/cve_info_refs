Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2024-45842:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper processing of URI data within HTTP PUT requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Path Traversal (CWE-22): The vulnerability allows an attacker to access files and directories outside of the intended web server root directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially retrieve unintended internal files from the affected device by crafting specific HTTP PUT requests.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- The attacker sends a crafted HTTP PUT request containing malicious URI data to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the affected device.
- No authentication is needed (PR:N) according to the CVSS score.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability allows for path traversal via HTTP PUT requests due to improper handling of URI data. This can enable an unauthenticated attacker with network access to potentially retrieve sensitive internal files on the affected device.
