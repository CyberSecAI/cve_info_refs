{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `highest_available` setting incorrectly assumes the identity's highest available AAL is `aal1` when it should be `aal2` due to an incorrect `available_aal` value stored in the database. This occurs when a user only uses the `code` login method (with passwordless enabled) along with a 2FA method and has not completed the 2FA challenge, leading to incorrect session authentication levels.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Incorrect evaluation of the highest available Authentication Assurance Level (AAL). Specifically, the system fails to properly recognize that a user with passwordless 'code' login and 2FA enabled should have `aal2` when `highest_available` is set.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could bypass the `aal2` requirement and access settings and whoami endpoints that should be protected by 2FA by stealing or guessing a valid login OTP. This would allow access to sensitive information or actions that should require a higher level of authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network-based. An attacker needs to steal or guess a valid login OTP of a user with only OTP for login enabled.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to obtain a valid login OTP (one-time password) for a user who has only the 'code' method for login and has 2FA enabled and an incorrectly stored available_aal in the database."
