Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization of URLs used in meeting embeds within the Decidim-meetings component. This allows for a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application is vulnerable to XSS due to improper handling of user-provided URLs used in meeting embeds. Specifically, a malformed URL can inject malicious scripts into the rendered page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
- The impact is considered high since it can compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the application and its users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The attack vector is network-based, meaning a remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing XSS payload.
- The attacker needs to find a way to get a user to interact with the malformed url through the meetings embeds.
- The attacker requires low privileges to exploit, however user interaction is required to trigger it.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects Decidim-meetings versions 0.28.0, 0.28.1, and 0.28.2.
- Patched versions are 0.28.3 and 0.29.0.
- A workaround is to disable the creation of meetings by participants in the meeting component.
- The CVSS score is 7.7, rated as High severity.
- CVSS vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N
