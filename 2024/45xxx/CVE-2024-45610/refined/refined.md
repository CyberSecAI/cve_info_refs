- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Cable form of the GLPI software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly sanitize user-provided input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a GLPI technician's browser session. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement of the GLPI interface
    - Other malicious actions within the technician's permissions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted malicious link that, when clicked by a GLPI technician, injects malicious scripts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must craft a malicious URL with embedded JavaScript.
    - The attacker needs to entice a GLPI technician to click on this malicious link, typically through social engineering.
    - The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
