- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The document lists multiple vulnerabilities, some within IBM Cognos Analytics itself (Open URL Redirection and Link Manipulation) and many stemming from third-party components, such as IBM Java, IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty and Open-Source Software (OSS). The specific root causes for each third party CVE are not listed within this document.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The weaknesses include a large number of vulnerabilities in various components that are used by IBM Cognos Analytics. Some are marked as "Vulnerable" and some as "Affected".  The IBM Cognos Analytics itself is vulnerable to Open URL Redirection and Link Manipulation vulnerabilities which are not described in detail.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The document does not specify the impact of each listed CVE. However, the table in the "Related Information" section designates the impact as "Affected" or "Vulnerable". In general, the impact of exploiting the mentioned vulnerabilities could range from denial-of-service and information disclosure to remote code execution. The "Related Information" section contains a link to an external IBM PSIRT News page containing vulnerability definitions, but the link only contains vulnerability definitions and doesn't contain impact information for specific CVEs.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vectors for the third-party CVEs are not specified in detail within the document. However, the document does state that IBM Cognos Analytics is vulnerable to Open URL Redirection and Link Manipulation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The document does not specify the attacker capabilities or position.

The document provides a list of CVEs that affect IBM Cognos Analytics, but it does not provide many details for each vulnerability itself, and instead refers to external documentation.
