The provided content is related to CVE-2024-45374.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The goTenna Pro ATAK plugin uses a weak password for sharing encryption keys via the key broadcast method.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Weak Password Requirements (CWE-521).
- The plugin uses a weak password for sharing encryption keys via the key broadcast method, making it susceptible to brute-force attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- If the broadcasted encryption key is captured over RF, and the password is cracked via brute force, it is possible to decrypt it and use it to decrypt all future and past messages sent via encrypted broadcast with that particular key.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A). An attacker needs to be within RF range to capture the broadcasted encryption key.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be within RF range to capture the broadcasted encryption key.
- They need to be able to perform a brute force attack to crack the weak password.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability only applies when the key is broadcasted over RF, which is an optional feature.
- The content also mentions other CVEs related to the same product.
- The advisory provides mitigation steps including using local QR code sharing for keys, and updating to the latest version of the plugin.
