The provided content is related to CVE-2024-45207.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a DLL injection attack vector within Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows. This attack is possible when the system's PATH environment variable is modified to include directories where a malicious actor can write files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- DLL injection vulnerability caused by insecure PATH environment variable configuration. Specifically, directories writable by untrusted users were present in the PATH variable.
- Improper handling of the PATH variable makes it susceptible to exploitation.
- The vulnerability is classified as a CWE-426 weakness.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges due to the injection of a malicious DLL. This could result in a complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is local.
- An attacker must be able to modify the system's PATH environment variable to include a directory they can write to.
- The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL into the created directory.
- The attacker leverages the vulnerable application loading the malicious DLL based on the PATH.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker requires low privileges on the target system.
- The attacker needs to be able to alter the system PATH environment variable and write files to a specified directory within it.
- The attacker must have some access to the local system.
