Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Inadequate access control for support information. General users can access support package files intended for administrators due to a lack of proper authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **CWE-200 (Information Exposure):** The vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive information contained within the support package.
*  **CWE-285 (Improper Authorization):** The system fails to enforce proper access controls, allowing general users to access resources intended for administrators.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker with general user privileges can access sensitive information, including software and OS version details, as well as error details, that is normally restricted to administrators.
*   This information can be used to further reconnaissance and potentially aid in more advanced attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **Log in as a general user.** The attacker must have a valid user account with general user privileges.
2.  **Use the logs query.** The attacker uses a specific query to find the location of the support package file.
3.  **Access the support package file.** The attacker accesses the support package file directly via the identified URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs a general user account on the OpenCTI platform.
*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the system through the web interface to send a specific log query to obtain the path to the support file.
*   The attacker must have basic knowledge of the system to retrieve the package using the logs query.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in OpenCTI versions 6.2.18 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability is patched in version 6.3.0.
*   The support package file is located at `http://<opencti_domain>/storage/get/support/UUID/UUID.zip`. The UUID is exposed via the logs query.
*   The CVSS score is 4.3, with a vector of `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N`
