Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-45611

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a combination of access control bypass and the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input when creating RSS feeds. An authenticated user can circumvent access control policies to create a private RSS feed, and within this feed, they can inject a malicious payload that leads to stored XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting):** Malicious code is injected into the RSS feed that is stored and executed within the context of another user's session when they view the feed.
*   **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control):** The vulnerability allows users to create a private RSS feed under another user's account, which should not be permissible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Stored XSS:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browser of another user who views the malicious RSS feed. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or further compromise of the user's account. The confidentiality of the victim user is put at risk.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack is network-based (AV:N).
*   It involves creating a malicious RSS feed and attaching it to another user's account, so an attacker has to use the application to perform this action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have a valid account on the application (PR:L).
*   **User Interaction:** The victim user must view the malicious RSS feed for the XSS payload to be triggered (UI:R).

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions 0.84 and later of the glpi software.
*   The patched version is 10.0.17.
*   The CVSS score is 5.7, which is considered moderate.
*   The attack complexity is low (AC:L), and the scope is unchanged (S:U)
*   The attack is focused on Confidentiality (C:H) while Integrity (I:N) and Availability(A:N) are not impacted.
