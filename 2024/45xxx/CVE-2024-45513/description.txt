An issue was discovered in Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) through 10.1. A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the /modern/contacts/print endpoint of Zimbra webmail. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when a crafted vCard (VCF) file is processed and printed. This could lead to unauthorized actions within the victim's session.
