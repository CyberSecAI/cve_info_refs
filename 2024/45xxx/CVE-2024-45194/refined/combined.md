Please refer to the **[Patch Installation](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/10.0.0/patch_installation)** steps for Patch Installation instructions.
As always, you are encouraged to tell us what you think in the Forums or open a support ticket to report issues.

**IMPORTANT: Instructions to update Zimbra's onlyoffice repository for installing zimbra-onlyoffice package.**

Please note that there is no change in the onlyoffice package. Add Zimbra's onlyoffice repository to the server before Zimbra Daffodil v10 installation/upgrade. These repos will be included bydefault in upcoming Zimbra Daffodil version.

```
https://repo.zimbra.com/apt/onlyoffice

```
```
https://repo.zimbra.com/rpm/onlyoffice

```

You must add your local repository to your RHEL/CentOS ConfigurationÂ :

**Redhat**

RHEL7

```
$ cat > /etc/yum.repos.d/zimbra-onlyoffice.repo <<EOF
[zimbra-onlyoffice]
name=Zimbra Onlyoffice RPM Repository
baseurl=https://repo.zimbra.com/rpm/onlyoffice/rhel7
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
EOF

```

RHEL8

```
$ cat > /etc/yum.repos.d/zimbra-onlyoffice.repo <<EOF
[zimbra-onlyoffice]
name=Zimbra Onlyoffice RPM Repository
baseurl=https://repo.zimbra.com/rpm/onlyoffice/rhel8
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
EOF

```
```
rpm --import <https://files.zimbra.com/downloads/security/public.key>
yum --disablerepo=* --enablerepo=zimbra-onlyoffice clean metadata
yum check-update --disablerepo=* --enablerepo=zimbra-onlyoffice --noplugins

```

**Ubuntu**

UBUNTU18

```
$ cat > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/zimbra-onlyoffice.list << EOF
deb [arch=amd64] https://repo.zimbra.com/apt/onlyoffice bionic zimbra
deb-src [arch=amd64] https://repo.zimbra.com/apt/onlyoffice bionic zimbra
EOF

```

UBUNTU20

```
$ cat > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/zimbra-onlyoffice.list << EOF
deb [arch=amd64] https://repo.zimbra.com/apt/onlyoffice focal zimbra
deb-src [arch=amd64] https://repo.zimbra.com/apt/onlyoffice focal zimbra
EOF

```
```
apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 9BE6ED79
apt-get update

```

**IMPORTANT: Incase above steps are missed for Onlyoffice installation, following is the manual steps for installation.**

* As root user run below commands: (assuming Zimbra is already installed)

```
$ wget -O /opt/zimbra/bin/zmonlyofficeinstall <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zimbra/zm-core-utils/10.0.9/src/bin/zmonlyofficeinstall>
$ chmod 755 /opt/zimbra/bin/zmonlyofficeinstall
$ /opt/zimbra/bin/zmonlyofficeinstall

```

**IMPORTANT: Zimbra OpenSSL with default FIPS Configuration**

* Please be advised that, TLS 1.2 is the minimum supported version if FIPS is being used with OpenSSL 3.0. We recommend using Zimbra with strong TLS configuration for increased security. Please follow instructions in **[Cipher-suites-wiki](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Cipher_suites)** to set correct ciphers as per current versions of openssl, nginx and postfix.
* From this patch going forward Zimbra OpenSSL will be configured to work with FIPS compliance enabled by default. You do not need to take any action, unless you run into issues, you can switch to the non-FIPS provider as follows:

* Run below commands to Enable/Disable FIPS providers on all servers.

Disable FIPS provider:

```
As root user run below commands

Take backup of openssl.cnf
cd /opt/zimbra/common/etc/ssl
cp openssl.cnf <backup-path>/openssl.cnf

Copy openssl-source.cnf file
cd /opt/zimbra/common/etc/ssl
cp openssl-source.cnf openssl.cnf

Verify that, FIPS provider is disabled:
Run below command and verify fips provider is not listed
/opt/zimbra/common/bin/openssl list --providers

As zimbra user run below commands
su - zimbra
zmcontrol restart

```

Enable FIPS provider:

```
As root user run below commands

Take backup of openssl.cnf
cd /opt/zimbra/common/etc/ssl
cp openssl.cnf <backup-path>/openssl.cnf

Copy openssl-fips.cnf file
cd /opt/zimbra/common/etc/ssl
cp openssl-fips.cnf openssl.cnf

Verify that, FIPS provider is enabled:
Run below command and verify fips provider is listed
/opt/zimbra/common/bin/openssl list --providers

As zimbra user run below commands
su - zimbra
zmcontrol restart

```

# What's New

## Modern Web App

**General**

* An option to turn off the deletion of appointments for declined meetings has been implemented. Users can now retain appointments in their calendars even if they decline the meeting.
* A PostCSS line return parsing error has been fixed, improving the stability and reliability of the stylesheet processing in the Modern UI.
* Implementation of truncated folder names in the Modern UI has been completed. Folder names that are too long will now be truncated appropriately to fit the interface.

**Mail**

* The tap-to-read or select functionality in the mobile mail list has been reconfigured to allow larger tap area. This update improves the user experience by making it easier to interact with emails on mobile devices.
* The formatting of footer and signature elements in mobile views has been adjusted for better readability and presentation.
* The folder list is no longer shown when composing emails in the Modern UI, reducing cognitive load for user when composing the email and reducing visual clutter.

## Admin Web Console

* Admin Users can now add or remove devices from databases using the admin UI Home â Configure â Global Settings â Mobile.

# Fixed Issues

## Zimbra Collaboration

* A file having a file name and contents in Japanese, received as an email attachment is correctly previewed.
* In ZCS 10, the OnlyOffice repository path has been removed from the installer. Users must now configure the OnlyOffice repository before installation. If this step is missed, the installer will not provide the option to install OnlyOffice. To address this, a new script has been provided for installing OnlyOffice post-installation. The script is compatible with ZCS 10.1. As a root user, execute the script `/opt/zimbra/bin/zmonlyofficeinstall`.
* Folder names with the + sign were not returned when listing folders through IMAP. The issue has been fixed.
* When creating a draft in a Web App with the subject and body containing special characters (Ä, Ä, Å¾, Å¡, Ä), syncing it with Gmail where the user's account is configured using ActiveSync and then editing the draft in Gmail results in unexpected characters (e.g.,Â ?) appearing when syncing back to ZWC. The issue has been fixed and the characters now appear correctly.
* We have resolved the issue where attempting to view the message headers of an email attachment resulted in a 'javax.servlet.ServletException' error.
* Even if the commercial certificates were installed on the server, OnlyOffice used self-signed certificates. The issue has been fixed.
* The issue of a lock failure exception during folder synchronization on Android devices has been resolved. The problem occurred when syncing deleted subfolders and shared mail across multiple devices simultaneously.
* The issue with ActiveSync has been fixed where folder IDs in the receiving account were overwritten by shared folder mount points during sync. This caused messages to appear in incorrect folders. The problem has been resolved, ensuring folder IDs remain correct and messages stay in their intended folders. Users facing this issue will have to reconfigure their account on the device.
* The problem where it was not possible to remove a mobile device from the admin console has been addressed. Admins can now successfully remove mobile devices as needed.
* After upgrading to version 10.0.6, users encountered a "no such object" error. This issue has been fixed, and the error no longer occurs.
* Fixed an issue where for certain system-generated emails, the hyperlink was getting modified which resulted in an invalid URL.
* Inline images and PDF files in some specific mails were not getting previewed in Web App. The issue has been fixed.
* Fixed an issue with Apple Calendar where the attendee's free/busy information was not displayed when creating a new event.
* Support for zmblobchk has been added to ensure consistency checks for mailboxes using S3 external storage for secondary or primary volumes. Previously, zmblobchk reported "blob not found" errors for messages stored on S3. zmblobchk now correctly handles and verifies data on S3, improving the accuracy of mailbox consistency checks.
* When using Owasp sanitizer, certain emails were not displayed correctly. The issue has been fixed.
* An issue has been resolved where file attachments with UTF-8 encoded names sent from Outlook for Mac were not decoded correctly in the Web App.
* When the Undo Send feature is enabled and a delegate attempts to send an email on behalf of the delegator, an error occurs and email is not sent. This issue has been fixed now.
* Fixed an issue with logging where the mailbox logs were getting flooded for accounts setup through EWS protocol.

## Modern Web App

**General**

* The issue where the "sender address is suspicious" warning was incorrectly triggered due to case differences in the email address has been resolved. The check for suspicious email addresses is now case-insensitive, in compliance with RFC standards
* An issue where extra body content was being added in the Modern UI mail body under certain conditions has been corrected.
* An issue in the Modern UI where moving emails in "Conversation view" caused unexpected behavior has been fixed.
* The issue where email body/text alignment in the Modern UI web app was incorrect has been resolved.
* Scrolling issues within the Modern UI have been addressed. Users should now experience smooth and consistent scrolling behavior across all supported apps including Zimbra desktop.
* The problem where S/MIME signing did not work in the Modern UI has been addressed. S/MIME signing functionality is now fully operational.
* An issue where editing the attendees or the body of a new event would not save the changes correctly has been fixed. All edits are now properly saved.
* The issue where meeting invitation emails incorrectly displayed a conflict banner for meetings has been resolved. The conflict banner now only shows when there is an actual scheduling conflict.
* An issue in Zimbra Connector for Outlook (ZCO) where creating a folder of unknown type resulted in errors has been fixed.
* The issue where there was no save button after searching and editing a contact has been resolved.
* In the Modern UI, an issue where Zimbra incorrectly showed all folder types in the folder tree has been fixed.
* An issue where multi-day all-day appointments were truncated to a single day has been fixed. Multi-day all-day events now display correctly across all intended dates.

**Mail**

* An issue where wide elements in emails were not displayed correctly when reading on mobile has been addressed. Emails now render properly on mobile devices regardless of content width.
* The "Edit as new" option was previously unavailable when no predefined signature was set. This issue has been resolved, and the option is now accessible regardless of signature settings.

**Calendar**

* The issue where the "Today" button on the calendar print dialog was not working has been fixed. The button now correctly navigates to today's date in the print preview.
* An issue in the Modern UI where the "New Event" body did not wrap text properly has been resolved. Additionally, the button alignment has been corrected to ensure proper layout.
* The issue where an error was thrown upon clicking the "Show Availability" button in the calendar has been resolved. Users can now view availability without encountering errors.

## Zimbra Connector for Outlook

* ZCO stops syncing when NO\_NAME is encountered in any contacts. The issue has been fixed.
* Fixed an issue where the tags created in the Web App were getting overwritten with tags created in ZCO.

# Known Issues

## Modern Web App

**Mail**

* When replying to or forwarding an email in plain text with attachments, an error message stating "Failed to Process this request" may appear when the draft is auto-saved. This issue occurs after switching the email format from HTML to plain text, especially when the email contains an image in the signature.
* When viewing a message if there are any distribution lists to which the mail is sent to then the distribution list are displayed twice.
* "Edit as New," "New Event," and "Print" functionalities do not work when the preview pane is disabled in the Zimbra Modern UI. As a workaround, please enable the preview pane to use these features.

**Briefcase**

* If is a new sub-folder is created by the user that sub-folder is displayed twice instead of once. The issue gets resolved upon refreshing or logging in again to the web client.

## Mail

* EML file importing is not working on Zimbra version 10.0.0 and above.

## Modern Web App

**General**

* A new feature has been implemented to ensure that Zimbra Modern UI supports Windows High Contrast mode. This enhancement makes UI elements, including checkboxes, buttons, links, and toast messages, clearly visible and usable for visually impaired users.
* Functionality to import and export ICS files to and from the calendar has been implemented, allowing for better calendar management and sharing across platforms. This feature has been developed as a zimlet which can be deployed by the administrator for individual users. Zimlet name - zimbra-zimlet-import-export-ics.
* A new feature allowing users to export and download emails as EML files has been added. This feature has been delivered as a Zimlet which is accessible on the Web app, the desktop app, the tablet as well as the mobile app. Zimlet name - zimbra-zimlet-download-email.
* Support for custom fonts in the Modern UI client and email composer has been added. Users can now utilize a broader range of fonts on the desktop for their emails. Zimlet name - zimbra-zimlet-custom-fonts.
* An option to turn off the deletion of appointments for declined meetings has been implemented. Users can now retain appointments in their calendars even if they decline the meeting.
* A PostCSS line return parsing error has been fixed, improving the stability and reliability of the stylesheet processing in the Modern UI.
* Implementation of truncated folder names in the Modern UI has been completed. Folder names that are too long will now be truncated appropriately to fit the interface.

**Mail**

* The tap-to-read or select functionality in the mobile mail list has been reconfigured to allow larger tap area. This update improves the user experience by making it easier to interact with emails on mobile devices.
* The formatting of footer and signature elements in mobile views has been adjusted for better readability and presentation.
* The folder list is no longer shown when composing emails in the Modern UI, reducing cognitive load for user when composing the email and reducing visual clutter.

Please refer user guide [here](https://zimbra.github.io/documentation/zimbra-10/user-guide.html#_new_age_zimlets) for the new zimlets introduced in 10.1.1

## Admin Web Console

* In Admin Console -> Home â Configure â Global Settings â Mobile, a new button "Remove from list" has been added that will remove devices from the device list and database. Devices using the EAS 16.0 version can only be removed from the list. The device will re-appear in the list if the account re-syncs from the device.

## Licensing

* The enhancement "Feature in Grace Period" gives information on the features that exceed the licensed limits and enter a 10-day grace period. Please refer to the admin guide [section](https://zimbra.github.io/documentation/zimbra-10/adminguide.html#_feature_in_grace_period) for more information.

# Fixed Issues

## Zimbra Collaboration

* The LDS logging mechanism has been enhanced with a rolling policy that manages log files based on size and time. Refer to the admin guide [section](https://zimbra.github.io/documentation/zimbra-10/adminguide.html#LDS_Troubleshooting) for more information.
* A file having a file name and contents in Japanese, received as an email attachment is correctly previewed.
* In ZCS 10, the OnlyOffice repository path has been removed from the installer. Users must now configure the OnlyOffice repository before installation. If this step is missed, the installer will not provide the option to install OnlyOffice. To address this, a new script has been provided for installing OnlyOffice post-installation. The script is compatible with ZCS 10.1. As a root user, execute the script `/opt/zimbra/bin/zmonlyofficeinstall`.
* Folder names with the + sign were not returned when listing folders through IMAP. The issue has been fixed.
* When creating a draft in a Web App with the subject and body containing special characters (Ä, Ä, Å¾, Å¡, Ä), syncing it with Gmail where the user's account is configured using ActiveSync and then editing the draft in Gmail results in unexpected characters (e.g.,Â ?) appearing when syncing back to ZWC. The issue has been fixed and the characters now appear correctly.
* Even if the commercial certificates were installed on the server, OnlyOffice used self-signed certificates. The issue has been fixed.
* The issue of a lock failure exception during folder synchronization on Android devices has been resolved. The problem occurred when syncing deleted subfolders and shared mail across multiple devices simultaneously.
* The issue with ActiveSync has been fixed where folder IDs in the receiving account were overwritten by shared folder mount points during sync. This caused messages to appear in incorrect folders. The problem has been resolved, ensuring folder IDs remain correct and messages stay in their intended folders. Users facing this issue will have to reconfigure their account on the device.
* The problem where it was not possible to remove a mobile device from the admin console has been addressed. Admins can now successfully remove mobile devices as needed.
* After upgrading to version 10.0.6, users encountered a "no such object" error. This issue has been fixed, and the error no longer occurs.
* Fixed an issue where In a certain scenario, license renewal alerts were sent to all the users using IMAP protocol to access their emails.
* Fixed an issue with Apple Calendar where the attendee's free/busy information was not displayed when creating a new event.
* Support for zmblobchk has been added to ensure consistency checks for mailboxes using S3 external storage for secondary or primary volumes. Previously, zmblobchk reported "blob not found" errors for messages stored on S3. zmblobchk now correctly handles and verifies data on S3, improving the accuracy of mailbox consistency checks.
* When using Owasp sanitizer, certain emails were not displayed correctly. The issue has been fixed.
* The problem where signature images failed to load with an "Error 401 (unauthorized)" has been fixed. Signature images now load correctly.
* An issue has been resolved where file attachments with UTF-8 encoded names sent from Outlook for Mac were not decoded correctly in the Web App.
* When the Undo Send feature is enabled and a delegate attempts to send an email on behalf of the delegator, an error occurs and email is not sent. This issue has been fixed now.
* The issue where users received "No such message exists" error messages for drafts has been resolved. Draft messages now behave as expected without triggering errors.
* Fixed an issue with logging where the mailbox logs were getting flooded for accounts setup through EWS protocol.

## Modern Web App

**General**

* The issue where the "sender address is suspicious" warning was incorrectly triggered due to case differences in the email address has been resolved. The check for suspicious email addresses is now case-insensitive, in compliance with RFC standards
* An issue where extra body content was being added in the Modern UI mail body under certain conditions has been corrected.
* An issue in the Modern UI where moving emails in "Conversation view" caused unexpected behavior has been fixed.
* The issue where email body/text alignment in the Modern UI web app was incorrect has been resolved.
* Scrolling issues within the Modern UI have been addressed. Users should now experience smooth and consistent scrolling behavior across all supported apps including Zimbra desktop.
* The problem where S/MIME signing did not work in the Modern UI has been addressed. S/MIME signing functionality is now fully operational.
* An issue where editing the attendees or the body of a new event would not save the changes correctly has been fixed. All edits are now properly saved.

* The issue where there was no save button after searching and editing a contact has been resolved.
* In the Modern UI, an issue where Zimbra incorrectly showed all folder types in the folder tree has been fixed.
* An issue where multi-day all-day appointments were truncated to a single day has been fixed. Multi-day all-day events now display correctly across all intended dates.

**Mail**

* An issue where wide elements in emails were not displayed correctly when reading on mobile has been addressed. Emails now render properly on mobile devices regardless of content width.
* The "Edit as new" option was previously unavailable when no predefined signature was set. This issue has been resolved, and the option is now accessible regardless of signature settings.

* If user has selected classic UI as the default UI, the user would get redirected to the classic UI even on the mobile browser. This issue has been fixed, and user would now get redirected to the modern UI on mobile devices irrespective of the selection of the default UI.
* If change password option was disabled for a user that would also disable the preferences tab for that user.
* The issue where the compose window would throw an error when adding attachments after the initial attachment was removed has been fixed.
* An issue where emails with attachments would fail to send when saved as drafts has been resolved.
* The issue where the compose window would throw an error after a draft is deleted has been fixed.
* The issue where the compose tab for an email 'Forward' action was overwritten by another draft has been resolved. Each compose action now opens in its own separate tab without interference.

## Admin Web Console

* The issue where the "Control+A" shortcut was not working to select all text in the Search bar of the Zimbra Admin Panel has been resolved. This fix now allows users to correctly use "Control+A" to select text in the search field across supported browsers.
* The issue where a member with a one-letter sub-domain in their email address could not be added has been resolved. Members with such email addresses can now be added without issues.
* The problem where email addresses with a one-letter sub-domain failed to send has been corrected. Emails with such addresses now send successfully.

## Zimbra Connector for Outlook

* ZCO stops syncing when NO\_NAME is encountered in any contacts. The issue has been fixed.
* Fixed an issue where the tags created in the Web App were getting overwritten with tags created in ZCO.

## Infrastructure

* When using self-signed certificated on Ubuntu22 and RHEL9 OS, Kerberos authentication does not work and gives a certificate error. Ubuntu22 and RHEL9 use the latest gsasl package version. Following are the ways to get Kerberos authentication working with self-signed certificates: (Use any one of them)

i. Using System Trust Settings: Adding a zimbra self-signed certificate to the "trusted list"

ii. Specify --x509-ca-file as '--x509-ca-file="path"'

iii. Ignoring Certificate Verification Errors: Use --x509-ca-file with the empty string ("") as a file name to use the old behavior to not abort on server certificate verification failures.
There is no issue if the commercial certificate is set up on the server.

# Known Issues

## Modern Web App

**Mail**

* When replying to or forwarding an email in plain text with attachments, an error message stating "Failed to Process this request" may appear when the draft is auto-saved. This issue occurs after switching the email format from HTML to plain text, especially when the email contains an image in the signature.
* When viewing a message if there are any distribution lists to which the mail is sent to then the distribution list are displayed twice.
* "Edit as New," "New Event," and "Print" functionalities do not work when the preview pane is disabled in the Zimbra Modern UI. As a workaround, please enable the preview pane to use these features.
* Users have reported encountering a âTypeError: r.querySelectorAll is not a functionâ error when trying to read emails in Zimbra Modern UI and Zimbra Desktop 4.39.0. This error prevents users from reading their emails. The issue appears to be specific to Zimbra Modern UI version 4.39.0 which was released with ZCS 10.1.1 release.
  + Workaround:
    - Clear Browser Cache - Ensure that the browser is not loading an older cached version of Modern UI. Clear the cache or try accessing the Modern UI in incognito mode.
    - Zimlet Reinstallation - For users experiencing this issue, re-deploying the zimbra-zimlet-date Zimlet may resolve the problem. Here are the steps:

```
su - zimbra
cd /opt/zimbra/zimlets-deployed
zmzimletctl undeploy zimbra-zimlet-datecd /opt/zimbra/zimlets-network/

```
```
cd /opt/zimbra/zimlets-network/
zmzimletctl deploy zimbra-zimlet-date.zip

```

- Restart the mailbox service

```
zmmailboxdctl restart

```

**Briefcase**

* If is a new sub-folder is created by the user that sub-folder is displayed twice instead of once. The issue gets resolved upon refreshing or logging in again to the web client.

## Mail

* EML file importing is not working on Zimbra version 10.0.0 and above.

# Zimbra Responsible Disclosure Policy

1. [Zimbra Tech Center](/wiki/Main_Page "Main Page")
2. [Security Center](/wiki/Category%3ASecurity_Center "Category:Security Center")
3. Zimbra Responsible Disclosure Policy

## Zimbra Responsible Disclosure Policy

Zimbra will publicly acknowledge Reporter of the vulnerability discovery if Reporter strictly meets the following criteria and wishes to be acknowledged.

### Definitions:

Reporter
The initial identifier of the vulnerability, either as reported to Zimbra directly or to a responsible Coordinator. Also known as the Discoverer, Originator or Researcher.
Coordinator
Optional third-party that facilitates the public release of vulnerability information. Examples of well-recognized responsible Coordinators include the following:

* Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center (CERT/CC): <https://www.cert.org>
* Internet Security Alliance (ISA): <http://www.isalliance.org>
* CVE: <https://cve.mitre.org>

Vendor(s)
Repairer(s) of the vulnerability and/or software that contains a vulnerability, generally referring to Zimbra but may include other commercial or pen-source software developers
Users
End user or administrator of the software, includes commercial and open-source customers and partners
Hybrid disclosure
A benign user or researcher does not announce the vulnerability knowledge to the public immediately, but instead allows the vendor some time to develop a patch. [H. Cavusoglu, H. Cavusoglu, and S. Raghunathan, âEfficiency of Vulnerability Disclosure Mechanisms to Disseminate Vulnerability Knowledgeâ, 2007]
Acknowledgement
Public recognition of the Reporter for responsible vulnerability disclosure
### Responsible Disclosure and Reporter Acknowledgement Policy:

1. The Reporter must be the initial identifier of the vulnerability, either as reported to Zimbra directly or to a responsible Coordinator.
2. Reporter must notify only Zimbra or a responsible Coordinator, such as CERT, of the vulnerability.
3. Within seven business days of initial contact by the Reporter, Zimbra should promptly acknowledge, with a personal response rather than an automated message, that it has received the report. If the Vendor does not send a satisfactory acknowledgement, the Reporter should attempt to escalate the issue with the Vendor. If the Reporter is still unsuccessful, he or she should seek the assistance of a responsible third-party Coordinator who may have existing credibility and open channels of communication with the Vendor. [reference: NIAC Vulnerability Disclosure Framework, National Infrastructure Advisory Council, Jan 2004, <http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/vdwgreport.pdf>]
4. When reporting a security vulnerability to Zimbra, the Reporter should provide, via encrypted communication, all technical information and related materials the Vendor would need to reproduce the issue. The Reporter should also provide complete revision information, including his or her implementationâs current patch level, and a description of the technologyâs environment (e.g. hardware, configuration, other applications installed, relevant details about the network topology, firewall rules, and anything else that may be of use). The Reporter should provide this information only after receiving acknowledgement from Zimbra and knowing with certainty that the information provided is going to the correct group. If the Reporter shares exploit code, the Reporter, Zimbra, and any involved Coordinator should use extreme care to ensure that it is properly labeled and protected. The Reporter should immediately notify Zimbra or Coordinator of any new information or errors in the original report. [reference: NIAC Vulnerability Disclosure Framework, National Infrastructure Advisory Council, Jan 2004]
5. The Reporter must act to protect the information from leaking to external parties between the time of reporting it to the Vendor and final public release. [NIAC Vulnerability Disclosure Framework, National Infrastructure Advisory Council, Jan 2004]
6. The vulnerability must be verified and CVSS scored by Zimbra or responsible Coordinator.
7. Zimbra will continue to keep Reporter apprised of the progress of a patch or release to fix the vulnerability.
8. Reporter must agree to hold all vulnerability details private until at least 30 days after a patch or release that fixes the issue has been made generally available (âGAâ) for the product. Upon 30 days after a patch or release is released, the Reporter may choose to publish detailed information, but may not publish an exploit under any circumstances.
9. Zimbra will publicly acknowledge the Reporter - if the Reporter approves of Acknowledgement - within 30 days after the release of an Release or Patch that addresses the problem, through the [Security Center](/wiki/Security_Center "Security Center").
10. Zimbra may modify, revise or update this Responsible Disclosure Policy, at any time, by updating this posting. You should visit this page from time to time to review the then-current policy. The most current version of the policy will supersede all previous versions.
