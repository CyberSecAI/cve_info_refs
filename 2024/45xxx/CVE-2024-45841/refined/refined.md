Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2024-45841:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resources (CWE-732)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper permission settings related to critical resources within the I-O DATA router's system. Specifically, an attacker with guest account access can access a specific file that contains credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker with a guest account can obtain information containing credentials by accessing a specific file. This can lead to further compromise of the device or network if those credentials provide elevated access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based (AV:N) as the attacker needs network access to the device.
*   The attack requires low access complexity (AC:L).
*   The attacker needs to have a guest account (PR:L) on the affected device.
*   No user interaction (UI:N) is needed for exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to access the network where the vulnerable router is located.
*   The attacker must have a valid guest account on the device.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects I-O DATA UD-LT1 and UD-LT1/EX routers with firmware versions 2.1.9 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 6.5, with a vector of AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, meaning confidentiality is highly impacted, but integrity and availability are not.
*   The vendor has released firmware version 2.2.0 for UD-LT1 and UD-LT1/EX, which fixes this vulnerability, along with CVE-2024-47133.
*   The vulnerability was reported to IPA by Takeshi Kuramori, Kaori Takashima, and Kohei Masumi of the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Cybersecurity Research Institute.
