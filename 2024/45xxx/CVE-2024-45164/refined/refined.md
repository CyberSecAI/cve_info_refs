Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-45164:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a **broken access control vulnerability** in the Akamai Applications Portal (specifically, SIA ThreatAvert).
- The application failed to implement proper authorization controls on the ThreatAvert Policy page, which should only be accessible to admin users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** Standard authenticated users were able to access and modify admin-level configurations (ThreatAvert policies) without proper authorization.
- **Missing Authorization Checks:** The application lacked checks to verify if the user had admin privileges before allowing access to the ThreatAvert Policy page and related functionalities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A standard user could:
    - View the ThreatAvert policies page (which is an admin page)
    - Enable or disable any ThreatAvert policy.
- This could potentially lead to:
    - Disruption of network security measures.
    - Allowing threats that would otherwise be blocked by ThreatAvert policies.
    - Potentially opening the network to attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct URL access:** A standard authenticated user could directly access the admin ThreatAvert policy page by navigating to a specific URL (`https://<IP-Address/Hostname>/#app/intelligence/threatAvertPolicies`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a valid user of the SIA Applications Portal.
- They need to be assigned the "standard" ThreatAvert user role (this role needs to be configured by the carrier).
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the specific URL to access the admin page.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was patched by Akamai in version 19.2.0 SPS release/Apps Portal Version 19.2.0.20240814 (or later).
- As a temporary mitigation, Akamai recommended removing ThreatAvert standard user role assignments and relying on admin users until the Apps Portal could be upgraded.
- The SIA ThreatAvert application is typically only accessible to carrier employees, specifically network security administrators.
- The vulnerability is further limited to internal (Internet Service Provider) personnel that are specifically authorized for the “standard” ThreatAvert user role.
- Akamai does not pre-populate any standard user credentials; this role assignment must be specifically configured by the carrier.
- A rogue employee could enable/disable some/all policy enforcement associated with the ThreatAvert product on inbound DNS queries.
- Any applied policy change would be reflected in ThreatAvert block reporting and therefore caught and re-applied in short order.
