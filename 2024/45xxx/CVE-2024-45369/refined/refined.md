{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The web application uses a weak authentication mechanism to verify that a request is coming from an authenticated and authorized resource.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper Authentication (CWE-287)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to gain unauthorized access which may lead to disclosure of sensitive information, modification of data, or denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable web application. No specific user privileges are needed. The attack complexity is rated as high as the weakness in authentication mechanism could require some prior reconnaissance."
