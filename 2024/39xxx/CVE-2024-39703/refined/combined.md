## 4. MITIGATIONS

ThreatQuotient has released the following for users to implement:

* ThreatQ Platform: Version 5.29.3

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.
* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems). Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) in the technical information paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.
* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams0905.pdf) for more information on avoiding email scams.
* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014) for more information on social engineering attacks.

No known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time.

**USE CASE:**
Vulnerability Management & Prioritization

# What is vulnerability management?

Vulnerability management and prioritization involve the systematic identification, assessment, and mitigation of weaknesses or vulnerabilities in an organization’s systems, applications, and networks. This process includes scanning and monitoring for vulnerabilities, assessing their severity and potential impact, and prioritizing remediation efforts based on factors such as exploitability, criticality, and exposure. By prioritizing vulnerabilities based on risk and business impact, organizations can focus their resources and efforts on addressing the most critical threats first, thereby reducing the likelihood of successful cyber attacks and minimizing potential damage to their assets and operations.

### The challenge:

It is simply impossible to patch and mitigate every software vulnerability present in an enterprise network. Historically, organizations would prioritize mitigation based on limited and inward-facing data:

* Server versus workstation
* Employee role
* Asset criticality
* Vulnerability score
* Patch availability

Despite this level of prioritization, patching remains one of the most time-consuming vulnerability management tasks. This approach also has limited effectiveness because it does not take into account knowledge of how that vulnerability is actively being exploited in the wild, and the risks associated by those adversaries leveraging it to a company’s specific environment.

## **Automate vulnerability management with ThreatQ TDR Orchestrator**

ThreatQuotient’s data-driven threat intelligence platform helps to balance between human & machine focused approaches ensuring that teams always have the best tool for the job.

Learn more about ThreatQ TDR Orchestrator, the industry’s first solution to introduce a simplified, data-driven approach for no code/low code automation of the visibility and prioritization needed to remediate the most critical vulnerabilities first.

## **The ThreatQuotient approach to vulnerability management**

A vulnerability is only as bad as the threat exploiting it and the impact on the organization. Security teams must take a risk-based approach to prioritizing vulnerabilities with knowledge about how vulnerabilities are being exploited.

ThreatQ allows security teams to focus their vulnerability management resources where the risk is greatest through the following three steps:

1. Understand the threats and which vulnerabilities threat actors are leveraging to determine relevance to the organization’s environment and prioritize which vulnerabilities to address first. For example, a vulnerability related to a [specific adversary campaign](https://www.securityweek.com/adversaries-take-advantage-seams-lets-close-them) and IOCs that have been seen in an organization’s SIEM and/or ticketing system should be addressed immediately. A vulnerability that has related threats and IOCs but they have not been known to target the organization’s specific industry should be watched but is a lower priority. A vulnerability with no known adversaries using it or associated IOCs may indicate it is not being exploited in the real world yet, and can be deprioritized for now.
2. Overlap adversaries that target the company with CVEs the adversaries use,  historical [victimology targets](https://www.threatq.com/victimology-target-association/) and vulnerability scan results for those targets to create a superior risk profile.
3. Reassess and re-prioritize on a continuous and ongoing basis as adversaries change tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), systems and applications evolve, and their usage within the organization’s environment does as well.

## **Outcomes:**

* Better situational awareness of attackers, their motivations and one’s own environment.
* Clear priorities on what actions to take first to address which vulnerabilities.
* Ability to focus on the vulnerabilities that are the most relevant based on the organization’s risk profile.
