1. FitNesseDownload

Download FitNesse here

## Official release: version

Download [fitnesse-standalone.jar](https://github.com/fitnesse/fitnessedotorg/raw/master/releases/version/fitnesse-standalone.jar) for this release from GitHub.

The changes are described in the [Release Notes](FitNesse/ReleaseNotes.html). The contributions to this release are listed the [GitHub release](https://github.com/unclebob/fitnesse/releases/tag/version).

You can also download [older releases](https://github.com/fitnesse/fitnessedotorg/tree/master/releases).

FitNesse requires the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 11.

**Note**: As of release 20121220, [FitNesse](FitNesse.html) comes in 2 flavours:

* *Fitnesse.jar* is for use in Maven or Ivy.
* Users who just want to run FitNesse by itself should download *fitnesse-standalone.jar* which comes with all dependencies (support libraries) included.

You can also find [FitNesse in the Maven Central Repository](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.fitnesse%22%20AND%20a%3A%22fitnesse%22).

FitNesse includes *slf4j-jdk14*, an slf4j implementation, to write its logging. Users who want to use a different logging implementation should exclude *slf4j-jdk14* so there will be no conflicts.

## Source

The source Code can be found on GitHub: <http://github.com/unclebob/fitnesse>

## What's next

It really takes very little time and effort to get [FitNesse](FitNesse.html) running on your machine.

 0 Ensure you have a supported Java version installed (version 11, **versions >= 15 are not supported**).

1. Click on the most recent fitnesse-standalone.jar file.
   * If this is a brand new installation, just put it in some convenient empty directory.
   * If this is an update, then copy it on top of the old fitnesse(-standalone).jar in your current installation.
2. Type java -jar fitnesse-standalone.jar
   * It will ask you to be patient as it installs or updates.
   * Your shell should respond with something like this:
     ```

         FitNesse (v20201213) Started...
          	port:              8001
          	root page:         fitnesse.wiki.FileSystemPage at ./FitNesseRoot
          	logger:            none
          	authenticator:     fitnesse.authentication.PromiscuousAuthenticator
          	page factory:      fitnesse.responders.PageFactory
          	page theme:        bootstrap
          	page version expiration set to 14 days.
     ```
3. Start up a browser and go to <http://localhost>
4. The main [FitNesse](FitNesse.html) screen should come up. That's it. You're ready to start using [FitNesse](FitNesse.html).

### It didn't work!

Most likely you have another web server running. Web servers default to port 80, so if another one is running on your machine you'll have to specify another port via a CommandLineOption. Try this command: java -jar fitnesse-standalone.jar -p 8080

Then point your browser to <http://localhost:8080>

Still no? Open me up.

### What to Do If You Have the Wrong Java Runtime Environment

* Release 20190119 and later require Java 8
* Release 20160515 and later require Java 7
* Release 20090818 and later require Java 6
* Release 20060719 and later require Java 5

FitNesse requires version 1.8 (Java 8) or Java 11 of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). If you see the messages:

```

C:\fitnesse>java -jar fitnesse-standalone.jar
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:
java/lang/CharSequence
        at fitnesse.FitNesse.parseCommandLine(Unknown Source)
        at fitnesse.FitNesse.main(Unknown Source)

```

Then you need to download and install version 8 or 11 of the JRE. Follow these steps:

* Press a key to close the command window
* Download a Java runtime (there are multiple providers, for instance [Amazon](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-8-ug/downloads-list.html), [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=hotspot) or [Azul](https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu-community/?version=java-8-lts&os=windows&package=jdk)) and download and install Java by following the instructions.
* (if required) Change the PATH environment variable so that it points to the new JRE.
  + Go to the /bin folder that contains java.exe, and copy the pathname (for example, *C:\Program Files\Amazon Corretto\jdk<version>*)
  + Go to Settings>Control Panel>System>Advanced>Environment Variables>PATH>Edit
  + Paste in that same complete pathname
  + Save the PATH environment variable, and close the System control panel
  + Start FitNesse again as described above

## What to do if Apache Velocity is not found

There are two builds of the [FitNesse](FitNesse.html) binary:

* **fitnesse.jar** contains only the fitnesse code, no dependencies. This is the version you use if you're using a dependency management system like [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) or [Apache Ivy](http://ant.apache.org/ivy/).
* **fitnesse-standalone.jar** is the big one-has-all jar file containing [FitNesse](FitNesse.html) and support libraries.

If you're seeing this:

```

C:\fitnesse>java -jar fitnesse.jar
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/velocity/context/Context
        at fitnesse.FitNesseContext.(FitNesseContext.java:29)
        at fitnesse.FitNesseContext.(FitNesseContext.java:39)
        at fitnesseMain.FitNesseMain.loadContext(FitNesseMain.java:88)
        at fitnesseMain.FitNesseMain.launchFitNesse(FitNesseMain.java:36)

```

You probably want the latter.

## Learning More

If you have not yet done so, check out the [Two Minute Example](FitNesse/UserGuide/TwoMinuteExample.html). To learn more about what [FitNesse](FitNesse.html) acceptance testing is all about, see [AcceptanceTests](FitNesse/UserGuide/AcceptanceTests.html). If you are ready to start creating [FitNesse](FitNesse.html) pages and test tables, check out EditingFitNessePages and CreatingTestTables.

## Memory Issues.

When you use FitNesse extensively, some operations take more than the default memory allocated to the JVM. This can cause tests to fail for *out of heap space* reasons. You can fix this by adding the -Xmx100M JVM argument to the java command line when you start FitNesse. java -Xmx100M -jar fitnesse.jar.

### Memory issues and the build.

If you build FitNesse from source, the ant script may fail for *out of heap space* reasons. You can fix this by setting the ANT\_OPTS environment variable to -Xmx100M.
