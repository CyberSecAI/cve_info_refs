- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application generates web links to external sites without properly preventing these sites from modifying security-critical properties of the `window.opener` object.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of `window.opener` object, potentially allowing external sites to control the original window.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker could expose sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions on the victims' web browser.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs through a crafted link to an external site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A remote attacker needs to craft a malicious external site and have a user click a link to that site generated by the vulnerable application.
