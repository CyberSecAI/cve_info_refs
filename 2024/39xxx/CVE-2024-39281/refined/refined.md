- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `ctl_persistent_reserve_out` command in the ctl(4) subsystem allows a caller to specify an arbitrary size that is then passed to the kernel's memory allocator without proper bounds checking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unbounded memory allocation. The lack of size validation on the input to `ctl_persistent_reserve_out` before allocation allows an attacker to request an arbitrarily large allocation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious guest can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) on the host by exhausting memory resources.
- **Attack vectors:** This vulnerability can be triggered by a malicious guest using virtio_scsi(4) or ctld(8).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send commands to the ctl subsystem, meaning they must have access to the guest OS and be able to use virtio_scsi or have access to ctld.
