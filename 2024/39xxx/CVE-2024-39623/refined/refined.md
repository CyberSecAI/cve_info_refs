- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The ListingPro theme for WordPress versions 2.9.4 and below is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The theme lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to force a logged-in user to execute unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website that triggers the vulnerable action in the ListingPro theme.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated, they only need to be able to entice a logged in user to perform a forged action, such as clicking a crafted link or visiting a malicious web page.
