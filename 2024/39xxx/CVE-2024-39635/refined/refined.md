- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control, allowing unprivileged users to execute higher privileged actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unprivileged users could potentially perform actions that should be restricted to users with higher privileges. Specific impact varies on a case-by-case basis.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a function lacks proper access control checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be a user (subscriber role) of the vulnerable WordPress instance.
