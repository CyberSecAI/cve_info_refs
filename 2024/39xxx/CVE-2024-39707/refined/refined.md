**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `IhisiServiceSmm` module.
- Specifically, IHISI function 0x49 can restore factory defaults for certain UEFI variables without requiring additional authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Authentication:** The lack of authentication for the IHISI function 0x49 allows unauthorized modification of UEFI variables.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **UEFI Variable Modification:** An attacker can modify UEFI variables by restoring them to factory defaults.
- **Roll-back Attack:** This modification can lead to a potential roll-back attack on affected platforms.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the IHISI interface, specifically function 0x49.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability has an attack vector of "Local" (AV:L).
- **High Privileges:** The attacker needs High Privileges (PR:H) to exploit this vulnerability.
- **No User Interaction:** No user interaction (UI:N) is required for the attack.
- **System Scope Changed:** The vulnerability impacts the system's scope (S:C).
- **No Confidentiality Impact:** There is no impact on confidentiality (C:N).
- **High Integrity Impact:** There is a high impact on integrity (I:H)
- **No Availability Impact:** There is no impact on availability (A:N).

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory mentions that the root cause is the same as CVE-2023-28149 but with a different impact.
- The severity rating is 5.3, with a vector string of `3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N`, suggesting a local, high-privilege attack with high integrity impact but with no impact on confidentiality and availability.
- The fix is provided through specific versions for different kernel versions (5.2 to 5.6).
