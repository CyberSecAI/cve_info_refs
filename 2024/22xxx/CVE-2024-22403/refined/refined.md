Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-22403:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the fact that OAuth2 authorization codes were not expiring.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- OAuth2 authorization codes were valid indefinitely, meaning that if an attacker obtained a code, they could use it to authenticate at any time. This violated the intended security model of OAuth2, where authorization codes are meant to be short-lived.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with a valid, but potentially old, authorization code could bypass the intended authorization flow and gain access to a user's account.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would need to obtain a valid OAuth2 authorization code. This could potentially happen via several attack vectors like MITM attacks, or if the authorization code was leaked.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to obtain a valid OAuth2 authorization code.
- The attacker must be able to make a request to the authorization server to exchange the code for an access token.
- No user interaction is required after the attacker has a valid code.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The fix implements a 10-minute expiration for OAuth2 authorization codes.
- Expired authorization codes are immediately deleted from the database when an attempt to use them is made and are also cleaned up on a monthly basis.
- A refresh token could previously be used as an authorization code, which is no longer possible after the fix.
- The fix includes new database columns and an index to track when the code was created.
- The vulnerability is classified as "Low" severity with a CVSS v3 score of 3.0. The score is broken down as follows: AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N
    - Attack vector: Network
    - Attack complexity: High
    - Privileges required: Low
    - User interaction: Required
    - Scope: Changed
    - Confidentiality: Low
    - Integrity: None
    - Availability: None
- The fix was implemented in Nextcloud versions 26.0.11, 27.1.6, and 28.0.0.
- The vulnerability has the CWE-657 designation.
