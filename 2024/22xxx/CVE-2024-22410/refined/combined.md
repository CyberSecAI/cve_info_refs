# Binary Planting

## Description

Binary planting is a general term for an attack where the attacker places (i.e., plants) a binary file containing
malicious code to a local or remote file system in order for a vulnerable application to load and execute it.

There are various ways this attack can occur:

1. Insecure access permissions on a local directory allow a local
   attacker to plant the malicious binary in a trusted location. (A
   typical example is an application installer not properly configuring
   permissions on directories used to store application files.)
2. One application may be used for planting a malicious binary in
   another application’s trusted location. (An example is the [Internet Explorer - Safari blended threat vulnerability](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/advisory/953818))
3. The application searches for a binary in untrusted locations,
   possibly on remote file systems. (A typical example is a Windows
   application loading a dynamic link library from the current working
   directory after the latter has been set to a network shared folder.)

## Risk Factors

## Examples

### Insecure Access Permissions-based Attack

1. A Windows application installer creates a root directory
   (`C:\Application`) and installs the application in it, but fails to
   limit write access to the directory for non-privileged users.
2. Suppose the application (`C:\Application\App.exe`) loads the
   WININET.DLL library by calling `LoadLibrary("WININET.DLL")`. This
   library is expected to be found in the Windows System32 folder.
3. Local user A plants a malicious `WININET.DLL` library in
   `C:\Application`
4. Local user B launches the application, which loads and executes the
   malicious WININET.DLL` instead of the legitimate one.

### Current Working Directory-based Attack

1. Suppose a Windows application loads the `DWMAPI.DLL` library by
   calling `LoadLibrary("DWMAPI.DLL")`. This library is expected to be
   found in the Windows System32 folder, but only exists on Windows
   Vista and Windows 7.
2. Suppose the application is associated with the `.bp` file extension.
3. The attacker sets up a network shared folder and places files
   `honeypot.bp` and `DWMAPI.DLL` in this folder (possibly marking the
   latter as hidden).
4. The attacker invites a Windows XP user to visit the shared folder
   with Windows Explorer.
5. When the user double-clicks on `honeypot.bp`, user’s Windows Explorer
   sets the current working directory to the remote share and launches
   the application for opening the file.
6. The application tries to load `DWMAPI.DLL`, but failing to find it in
   the Windows system directories, it loads and executes it from the
   attacker’s network share.

# Binary Planting Attack on Windows Platforms

Low

[atodorov](/atodorov)
published
GHSA-cx5c-xwcv-vhmq
Jan 17, 2024

## Package

creditcoin-node

## Affected versions

None

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Summary

The Windows binary of the Creditcoin node loads a suite of DLLs provided by Microsoft at startup. If a malicious user has access to overwrite the program files directory it is possible to replace these DLLs and execute arbitrary code. For more details on this type of binary planting attack please refer to this [OWASP.org article](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Binary_planting).

### Details

The DLLs loaded at startup on Windows are the following:

1. iphlpapi.dll - Windows networking subsystem
2. bcrypt.dll - Windows cryptographic primitives
3. MSVCP140.dll - Part of Microsoft C++ Runtime library
4. VCRUNTIME140.dll - Part of the visual studio runtime
5. VCRUNTIME140\_1.dll - More runtime stuff
6. VCRUNTIME140.dll - runtime
7. VCRUNTIME140\_1.dll - runtime
8. CRYPTBASE.DLL - Microsoft cryptographic API

### Impact

It is the view of the blockchain development team that the threat posed by a hypothetical binary planting attack is minimal and represents a low-security risk. The vulnerable DLL files are from the Windows networking subsystem, the Visual C++ runtime, and low-level cryptographic primitives. Collectively these dependencies are required for a large ecosystem of applications, ranging from enterprise-level security applications to game engines, and don’t represent a fundamental lack of security or oversight in the design and implementation of Creditcoin. The blockchain team takes the stance that running Creditcoin on Windows is officially unsupported and at best should be thought of as experimental.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
