Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-22901:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of hardcoded, default credentials for the MySQL database used by Vinchin Backup & Recovery.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Hardcoded Credentials:** The application uses a static username (`vinchin`) and password (`yunqi123456`) for its MySQL database.
- **Lack of Access Control:** The MySQL port may be exposed publicly without hostname-based restrictions for database logins.
- **Configuration Flaw:** The software lacks proper security configurations for database access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the MySQL database using the hardcoded credentials.
- **Data Modification:**  Attackers can potentially alter the database, including creating rogue admin users and gaining unauthorized system privileges.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By creating rogue admin users, attackers can gain full control of the system through the web interface.
- **Remote Code Execution (Chained Exploit):** When combined with other vulnerabilities (such as command injection flaws) in the web application, this vulnerability can contribute to unauthenticated RCE.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited via remote access to the MySQL database if the port is exposed to the public internet.
- **Local Access:** Attackers with local network access can also exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the server where Vinchin Backup & Recovery is running and the exposed MySQL port.
- **No Authentication Required (Initially):**  The attacker does not need to initially authenticate to the application but to the MySQL database.
- **Knowledge of Credentials:** Attackers need knowledge of the hardcoded MySQL username and password to directly access the database.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Vinchin Backup & Recovery version 7.2 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Valentin Lobstein.
*   The vendor has not addressed previous disclosures and has not patched the reported vulnerabilities, which makes the issue more serious, as it can be combined with other vulnerabilities for RCE.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as "Incorrect Access Control".
*   This vulnerability is part of an exploit chain that can lead to complete system compromise, along with other vulnerabilities like default SSH credentials and command injection flaws.
