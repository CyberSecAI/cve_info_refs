Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-22902:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the presence of default, hardcoded root credentials within Vinchin Backup & Recovery version 7.2 and earlier. Specifically, the username is `root` and the password is `Backup@3R`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Default Credentials:** The software is shipped with a default root password that is publicly known.
*   **Insecure SSH Configuration:** SSH root logins with password authentication are enabled by default.
*   **Lack of Enforcement:** The installation process does not prompt or require users to change the default root credentials.
*   **Incorrect Access Control:** The software's default configuration allows unauthorized access due to weak access controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized root access to the Vinchin Backup & Recovery system.
*   **Escalation of Privileges:** The root access allows complete control over the system, enabling attackers to perform a variety of malicious actions.

*   **Knowledge of Default Credentials:** Attackers need to be aware of the default username (`root`) and password (`Backup@3R`).
*  **No further authentication is required after using the default credentials**

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content emphasizes the lack of documentation or guidance from Vinchin regarding changing the root password in the affected version.
*   The vulnerability is considered a serious security oversight.
