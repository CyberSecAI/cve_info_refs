- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Profile Builder Pro WordPress plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions, leveraging their existing authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a crafted request triggered by a logged-in user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to induce a logged-in user with sufficient privileges to execute the malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
