- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Kubernetes secrets in the IBM Storage Defender Connection Manager on-premises environment (OVA) are obfuscated using base64 encoding instead of being encrypted.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Secrets are not properly encrypted, using only base64 encoding for obfuscation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker who has gained root access to the environment can read the secrets from the Kubernetes configuration.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to gain root access to the on-premise environment running the vulnerable application
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Root access to the on-premises environment where IBM Storage Defender Connection Manager is deployed.
