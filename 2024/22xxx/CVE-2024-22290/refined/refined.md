- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Custom Dashboard Widgets plugin (<= 1.3.1) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious request and tricking an authenticated user into executing it, an attacker can perform unauthorized actions on the vulnerable site on behalf of the victim.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into interacting with a malicious request. The user needs to have sufficient privileges to execute the desired action. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
