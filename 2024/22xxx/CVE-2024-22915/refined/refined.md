Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-use-after-free vulnerability occurs in the `swf_DeleteTag()` function within the `rfxswf.c` file of the swftools library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Heap-use-after-free:**  The code attempts to access memory that has already been freed, leading to a use-after-free condition.
- **Out-of-bounds write:** The use-after-free leads to an out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The immediate impact is a program crash due to the memory corruption.
- **Potential code execution:** Although not explicitly stated, heap-use-after-free vulnerabilities can often be leveraged for arbitrary code execution by carefully crafting the memory layout and contents.

**Attack vectors:**
- **File processing:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing a crafted SWF file using the `swfc` tool. Specifically, the tool attempts to delete a tag after it has already been freed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to supply a malicious SWF file:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted SWF file to the `swfc` tool.

**Technical details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `lib/rfxswf.c` at line 1193 in the `swf_DeleteTag` function.
- The issue is triggered during the processing of the SWF file within the `removeFromTo` function, `s_endSWF` function, `s_end` function, `c_end` function, `parseArgumentsForCommand` function and `main` function.
- The memory in question was allocated using `calloc` and freed by `swf_FreeTags`, and the `swf_DeleteTag` tries to access it after it is freed.
- The ASan output confirms a write of 8 bytes at a freed memory location, indicating memory corruption.

**Additional notes:**
- The issue was discovered by "Diggingwei".
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) file "poc.zip" can be used to reproduce the issue.
