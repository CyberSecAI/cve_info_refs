- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of user-supplied input in the `content` parameter of the `/post/save` endpoint. Specifically, the input is not properly encoded or filtered on the server-side before being rendered in the web page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the website.
    - The attacker can execute malicious scripts in the context of other users' browsers.
    - The attacker can potentially steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other harmful actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code within the "content" parameter when creating or editing a post.
    - The injected code is stored on the server.
    - When a user views the post with the malicious content, the injected code executes in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs the ability to create or edit a post on the vulnerable application, specifically through the `/post/save` endpoint.
    - The attacker needs to have network access to the application.
    - The attacker does not require any special privileges beyond those normally needed to use the forum.

The content also mentions an information exposure issue:
- **Information Exposure:** The cookie after successful user login contains an MD5 hash of the user's password, which is vulnerable if leaked. An attacker could try to crack this with hash collision attacks.
