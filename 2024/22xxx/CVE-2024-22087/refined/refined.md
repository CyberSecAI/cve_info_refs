- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `route()` function within `main.c`, specifically due to the use of `sprintf` to construct a file path without proper bounds checking.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - **Stack buffer overflow**: The `sprintf` function copies data into a fixed-size buffer (`file_name`) without checking its length. If the combined length of the directory and URI exceeds the buffer size, a buffer overflow occurs.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
  - **Remote Code Execution**: This vulnerability can lead to remote code execution, as an attacker could potentially overwrite parts of the stack, allowing for arbitrary code execution.

- **Attack vectors**:
  - Sending an HTTP GET request with an extremely long URI is the attack vector, causing the server to attempt to concatenate the supplied URI with the `PUBLIC_DIR` constant and write the result into a fixed-size buffer on the stack.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No special privileges are needed.
