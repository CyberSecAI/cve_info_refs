Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is improper input sanitization in the "name" field when creating or modifying groups in Kanboard. The application does not properly encode or sanitize user-supplied input, specifically HTML tags.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **HTML Injection:** The application allows users to inject arbitrary HTML code into the group name field. This occurs because the application doesn't properly neutralize or escape the HTML tags before displaying the group name. This leads to a stored HTML injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **User Redirection:** Attackers can inject meta tags to redirect users to malicious websites when they view their group memberships.
*   **Credential Theft:** By injecting HTML that includes forms, the attacker can craft a fake login page, redirect the user to that page, and steal their credentials.
*   **Arbitrary HTML Execution:** Injected HTML allows an attacker to execute arbitrary HTML code within the context of the victim's browser, leading to potentially diverse attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the "name" field when creating a new group or modifying an existing one in Kanboard's group management feature. An attacker can inject malicious HTML code into this field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to create or edit groups, which is generally an administrative privilege in Kanboard. However, a non-admin user may be able to exploit this vulnerability through other means, if they are able to manipulate the group name. The attacker needs to be able to access the Kanboard application to create the malicious group.
