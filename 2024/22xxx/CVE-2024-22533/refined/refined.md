Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Beetl versions up to 3.15.12. The `DefaultNativeSecurityManager` employs a blacklist to restrict access to certain Java classes and packages, but this blacklist can be bypassed using reflection techniques.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Insufficient Blacklist:** The `DefaultNativeSecurityManager` uses a blacklist which is not comprehensive enough to prevent access to dangerous functionalities. Specifically, the blacklist does not prevent access to reflection mechanisms.
    *   **Reflection Enabled:** The application allows the use of reflection, which enables attackers to bypass the blacklist restrictions and invoke methods of restricted classes.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server by injecting malicious template code. This allows them to potentially compromise the server, gain access to sensitive data, or disrupt the service.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Template Injection:** The attacker injects malicious code into a Beetl template. The vulnerability occurs where user-controlled input is used to generate the template.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Template Control:** The attacker must have the ability to inject code into the template string that will be processed by the vulnerable Beetl instance. This would typically mean the attacker can control input that is used in the template.
    *   **Access to the Application:** The attacker needs network access to an application that uses a vulnerable version of Beetl.

*   **Technical Details:**
    *   The vulnerability can be exploited by leveraging reflection, specifically using the following:
        *   `org.springframework.beans.BeanUtils.findDeclaredMethod`: to obtain Method objects.
        *   `org.springframework.util.ClassUtils.getDefaultClassLoader().loadClass()`: to load classes, including those on the blacklist, such as `java.lang.Runtime`.
    *   A complete PoC is provided:
        `${@org.springframework.beans.BeanUtils.findDeclaredMethod(@org.springframework.util.ClassUtils.getDefaultClassLoader().loadClass('java.lang.Runtime'),'exec',@org.springframework.util.ClassUtils.getDefaultClassLoader().loadClass('java.lang.String')).invoke(@org.springframework.beans.BeanUtils.findDeclaredMethodWithMinimalParameters(@org.springframework.util.ClassUtils.getDefaultClassLoader().loadClass('java.lang.Runtime'),'getRuntime').invoke(null,null),'calc.exe')}`
    *   The vulnerability is demonstrated by executing `calc.exe` on the server.

* **Suggested Mitigation:** The primary suggested mitigation is to disable `java.lang.reflect` functionality within the `DefaultNativeSecurityManager`, or to completely disable the `DefaultNativeSecurityManager` if no security restrictions are required.
