Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause lies in the device's authentication process, specifically how it handles incorrect password attempts after a successful login. The device exposes the hash of the correct password in the response, even when an incorrect password is submitted for authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Exposure of Password Hash:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of the correct password's hash in the response to a login attempt with an incorrect password.
*   **Replay Attack:** This exposed hash can be used to bypass authentication, even without knowing the actual password, effectively enabling a replay attack.
*   **Session Management Flaw:** The vulnerability indicates a flaw in how the device manages authenticated sessions and handles subsequent authentication requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to gain complete access to the device's administration interface without knowing the actual password.
*   **Device Compromise:** Once inside, the attacker can change device settings, potentially disrupting network services, or even using the device to launch further attacks.
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive device information such as network keys, configurations, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Interception:** The attacker needs to intercept HTTP requests made to the router's login page using a tool like tcpdump or Wireshark.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle:** A man-in-the-middle position on the local network would make the interception easier.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Initial Authentication:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerability after the device is successfully logged into at least once by the legitimate user. This suggests a need to have a user with valid credentials log in once on a web browser.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the device and be able to intercept network traffic between the user's browser and the router.
*   **Request Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to modify the login request by replacing the incorrect password hash with the correct password hash obtained in the previous request.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was identified on an "Intelbras Roteador ACtion RF 1200" with firmware version 1.2.2, which was the latest available at the time of testing.
*   The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the manufacturer, who plans to release a firmware update to address the issue.
*   The captured hash also included 6 extra characters that should be ignored.
