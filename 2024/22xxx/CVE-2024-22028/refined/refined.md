Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-22028:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient technical documentation for the thermal camera TMC series. The documentation fails to mention the existence of a network interface and internal storage for pictures and measurement data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-1059:** Incomplete documentation. The lack of information regarding data storage and network capabilities leads to a lack of user awareness of potential privacy and security risks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker with physical access to the device can retrieve internally saved data such as thermal images, temperature measurements and potentially facial images depending on the device model. Users may not be aware that this data is stored or that a network interface is available for remote access.
*   Users are unaware that data is being stored, which could lead to unintentional data leakage when reselling or disposing of the device without following specific procedures.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** The primary attack vector is physical access to the thermal camera.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs physical access to the affected thermal camera.
*   The attacker needs to possess the skills necessary to extract the data either through a network interface or by disassembling the camera and accessing the storage directly, depending on the device model.
*    The JVN analysis states "low privileges" are required, which would likely be access to the physical device, rather than a need to bypass security features.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all firmware versions of the following thermal cameras: 3R-TMC01, 3R-TMC02, 3R-TMC03, 3R-TMC04, 3R-TMC05, and 3R-TMC06.
*   The vendor, THREE R SOLUTION CORP. JAPAN, has acknowledged the issue and provided a workaround which involves deleting the stored data before disposing of or reselling the device, with specific instructions differing across product models.
*   The JVN analysis assumes a scenario where the user is unaware of the stored data and may give the device away without performing data deletion.
*   The CVSS v3 score is 2.1, indicating a low severity issue, primarily due to the need for physical access and the limited impact on confidentiality. The CVSS v2 score is 1.7 with similar implications.
