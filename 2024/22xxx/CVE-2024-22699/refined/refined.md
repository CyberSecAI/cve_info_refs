The provided content relates to CVE-2024-22699.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in FlyCms v1.0.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user. Specifically, the `/system/admin/update_group_save` endpoint is vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to modify group settings within the FlyCms application, leading to unauthorized changes or potential disruption of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker can craft a malicious HTML page that automatically submits a form to the vulnerable endpoint (`/system/admin/update_group_save`), forcing the user's browser to send a request to the server without the user's knowledge or consent if the user is authenticated on the targeted website.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into visiting a malicious website or opening an attacker controlled HTML content (e.g. via phishing). The attacker does not need to know the user's credentials but requires the user to be authenticated on the targeted application.
