{
  "vulnerability": {
    "overview": "The vulnerability is a memory leak in the `ovs_pcap_open` function within Open vSwitch (OVS) version 2.17.8. The initial report incorrectly identified the leak in `xmalloc__`, but was later corrected.",
    "root_cause": "A memory leak occurs when opening a pcap file via the `ovs_pcap_open` function. Specifically, the memory allocated within this function isn't freed under certain conditions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-401: Missing Release of Memory After Effective Lifetime"
    ],
    "impact": "The primary impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service due to memory exhaustion. If an attacker repeatedly triggers the vulnerable code, the server's available memory can be depleted, leading to performance issues or a crash.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a pcap file is opened. Although not explicitly stated how the pcap file is provided, it's implied that this can be done remotely.",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker must be able to trigger the opening of pcap files within the context of the vulnerable Open vSwitch application. This might involve sending specially crafted packets or providing a malicious pcap file via network interface, or indirectly by manipulating the software that interacts with the affected OVS instance."
