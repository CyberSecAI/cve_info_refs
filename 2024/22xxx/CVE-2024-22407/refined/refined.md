- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The state handler for orders in Shopware CMS fails to sufficiently verify user authorizations for actions that modify the payment, delivery, and/or order status.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inadequate access control implementation, specifically related to order state transitions. Users without 'write' permissions for orders can still change the order state.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Users can modify order states (payment, delivery, or overall order status) without the necessary 'write' permissions. This could lead to unauthorized manipulation of orders.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs a high level of privileges within the system, though not necessarily 'write' permissions for orders, to exploit the vulnerability. No user interaction is required for exploitation.
