# Ursa CL-Signatures Revocation allows verifiers to generate unique identifiers for holders

Moderate

[swcurran](/swcurran)
published
GHSA-6698-mhxx-r84g
Jan 16, 2024

## Package

cargo

ursa
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

0.1.0

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Summary

The revocation scheme that is part of the Ursa CL-Signatures implementations has a flaw that could impact the privacy guarantees defined by the AnonCreds verifiable credential model. Notably, a malicious verifier may be able to generate a unique identifier for a holder providing a verifiable presentation that includes a Non-Revocation proof.

### Details

The revocation scheme that is part of the Ursa CL-Signatures implementations has a flaw that could impact the privacy guarantees defined by the AnonCreds verifiable credential model, potentially allowing a malicious verifier to generate a unique identifier for a holder that provides a verifiable presentation that includes a Non-Revocation proof.

The flaws affects all CL-Signature versions published from the [Hyperledger Ursa](https://github.com/hyperledger-archives/ursa) repository to the [Ursa Rust Crate](https://crates.io/crates/ursa), and is fixed in all versions published from the [Hyperledger AnonCreds CL-Signatures](https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-clsignatures-rs) repository to the [AnonCreds CL-Signatures Rust Crate](https://crates.io/crates/anoncreds-clsignatures).

The addressing the flaw requires updating AnonCreds holder software (such as mobile wallets) to a corrected CL-Signature implementation, such as the [AnonCreds CL Signatures Rust Crate]. Verifying presentations from corrected holders requires a updating the verifier software to a corrected CL-Signatures implementation. An updated verifier based on AnonCreds CL-Signatures can verify presentations from holders built on either the flawed Ursa CL-Signature implementation or a corrected CL-Signature implementation

The flaw occurs as a result of generating a verifiable presentation that includes a Non-Revocation proof from a flawed implementation.

### Impact

The impact of the flaw is that a malicious verifier may be able to determine a unique identifier for a holder presenting a Non-Revocation proof.

### Mitigation

Upgrade libraries/holder applications that generate AnonCreds verifiable presentations using the [Ursa Rust Crate](https://crates.io/crates/ursa) to any version of the [AnonCreds CL Signatures Rust Crate].

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
