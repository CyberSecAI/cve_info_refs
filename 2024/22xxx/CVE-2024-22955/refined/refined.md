The provided content details a stack-buffer-underflow vulnerability in `swftools`.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A stack-buffer-underflow occurs in the `parseExpression` function within `swftools/src/swfc.c` at line 2576. Specifically, there is a read operation that accesses memory outside the bounds of the allocated stack buffer. The ASAN output indicates that the underflow happens at offset 28 of the `chr2index.i` variable in the stack frame.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-buffer-underflow: Reading before the beginning of an allocated stack buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The immediate impact observed is a crash due to the AddressSanitizer detecting the memory error.
- This type of vulnerability could potentially lead to other issues if exploited without ASAN, such as information disclosure or arbitrary code execution, though these are not explicitly mentioned in this report.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted SWF file, as demonstrated by the provided PoC (`gbo_poc.zip`). The `swfc` tool from `swftools` is used to parse this malicious file, causing the underflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious SWF file to be processed by `swfc`. This likely means they either need to get a user to process this file with the vulnerable tool or they would need to be able to utilize this tool on a server they control.
