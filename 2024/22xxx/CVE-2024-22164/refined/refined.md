Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper size limitation on request handling of investigation attachments in Splunk Enterprise Security. Specifically, the attachment endpoint does not enforce limits on the size of the request which allows an attacker to cause a denial of service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted Size Upload:** The primary weakness is the absence of request size limits on the investigation attachment endpoint, allowing an attacker to upload very large files or send oversized requests.
- **Denial of Service:** The oversized requests consume system resources, leading to a denial of service by making the investigation inaccessible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker can cause a specific investigation within Splunk Enterprise Security to become inaccessible to authorized users.
- **Disruption of Incident Response:** This can disrupt security teams from effectively managing and investigating security incidents.
- **Prolonged Exposure:** The inability to access investigations can lead to prolonged exposure and potentially data breaches if incidents are not addressed in a timely manner.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network based where a malicious user uploads a large file or sends a large request through the attachment endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least collaborator access to the target investigation.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Splunk instance.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:** Splunk Enterprise Security versions below 7.1.2 are vulnerable.
- **Mitigation:** The vulnerability is addressed by upgrading Splunk ES to versions 7.1.2, 7.2.0, 7.3.0 or higher.
- **Detection:** A Splunk detection query, `splunk_es_dos_through_investigation_attachments_filter` is provided to identify attempts at exploitation.
- **CWE:** The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-400, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption.
