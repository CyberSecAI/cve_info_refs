{
  "CVE-2024-22076": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the ability to execute arbitrary PHP code with SYSTEM-level privileges due to insufficient input validation and lack of sanitization when handling user-supplied input related to the Job Parser feature of MyQ Print Server.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Default admin credentials",
      "Lack of input validation",
      "Remote code execution",
      "Insufficient sanitization",
      "PHP code execution as NT AUTHORITY user (SYSTEM)"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain full control of the compromised machine, manipulate files, access sensitive data, and potentially compromise the entire system over the internet due to remote code execution as the highest privilege level user, NT AUTHORITY.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Web interface of the MyQ Print Server application.",
      "Exploiting the Job parser functionality with a malicious PHP payload"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Network access to the vulnerable MyQ Print Server web application.",
      "Valid administrative user account.",
       "The setting Job parser must be enabled."
    ],
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is triggered by the execution of a malicious PHP payload through the Job parser feature. The 'system' function in PHP is utilized to execute arbitrary system commands as the NT Authority user. The vulnerability exists in MyQ Print Server before version 8.2 patch 43. The vendor has released a patch and implemented a setting to lock/unlock Queueâ€™s Scripting (PHP) settings."
