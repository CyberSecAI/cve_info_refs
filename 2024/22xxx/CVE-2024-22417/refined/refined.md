  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": "The provided content contains information related to CVE-2024-22417. \n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe `element` method in `app/routes.py` does not validate the `src_type` and `element_url` variables, which are user-controlled. These variables are passed to the `send` method, which performs a GET request, and the content is then passed to the `send_file` function with the user-controlled `src_type`. This lack of validation allows an attacker to control the HTTP response content type, leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n- Unvalidated user input\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- An attacker can craft a malicious URL and send it to a victim. The link, using a trusted domain, may trick users into clicking it. The attacker can then execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This may be used to steal user credentials or perform other malicious actions.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- A crafted URL with malicious JavaScript code that targets the `element` endpoint.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and persuade a user to click on it. The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim. The attacker must be able to send a GET request to the target host."
