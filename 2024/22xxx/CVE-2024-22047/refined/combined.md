# Race Condition

Low

published
GHSA-hjp3-5g2q-7jww
Apr 28, 2023

## Package

bundler

audited
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

4.0.0

## Patched versions

5.3.3

## Description

In certain setups with threaded web servers, Audited's use of `Thread.current` can incorrectly attributed audits to the wrong user.

Fixed in 5.3.3.

In March, [@convisoappsec](https://github.com/convisoappsec) noticed that the library in question had a Race Condition problem, which caused logs to be registered at times with different users than those who performed the genuine actions.

* The first issue we identified was from November 2021: [#601](https://github.com/collectiveidea/audited/issues/601)
* So the solution was implemented in the following Pull Request: [#669](https://github.com/collectiveidea/audited/pull/669)
* And the feature was published in version 5.3.3: RELEASE: [#671](https://github.com/collectiveidea/audited/pull/671)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| Hello,  We are using the audit to generate around 20 thousand records daily. In some cases we find that the user who performed the action is incorrect. Analyzing the code we saw that the Thread.current[:audited\_store] method is called to get the current user. We use AWS with loadbalancer with 2 to 4 servers at peak hours.  We need help to understand why this is happening. |

| Hi [@tiagocassio](https://github.com/tiagocassio) We solved using RequestStore. This is the monkey patch. I hope it helps you too.  ```   class << self     def store       current_store_value = RequestStore.store[:audited_store]        if current_store_value.nil?         RequestStore.store[:audited_store] = {}       else         current_store_value       end     end   end    # add sudo_user_id   class Sweeper     STORED_DATA = {       current_remote_address: :remote_ip,       current_request_uuid: :request_uuid,       current_user: :current_user,       sudo_user_id: :sudo_user_id     }      def sudo_user_id       controller.try(:sudo_user_id)     end   end    class Audit     def set_audit_user       self.user ||= ::Audited.store[:audited_user] # from .as_user       self.user ||= ::Audited.store[:current_user].try!(:call) # from Sweeper       self.sudo_user_id ||= ::Audited.store[:sudo_user_id]       nil # prevent stopping callback chains     end   end end  ``` |

| After updating to 5.3.3, which uses `RequestStore`, I'm facing some issues. The reason is `RequestStore` clears the store object after each request [[Docs](https://github.com/steveklabnik/request_store/blob/master/README.md?plain=1#L112C18-L114)].  So before the update, the workflow was like this:   1. The rails server starts. 2. A model, e.g. `User`, calls the `audited` method, that adds the `users_auditing_enabled` key to the store. 3. A request is received, the key `users_auditing_enabled` is fetched from the store, in order to check the audit is enabled for that class. 4. The request is served, the store is not modified and the next request will be able to fetch `users_auditing_enabled` from the store.   And this is the new workflow when using `RequestStore`:   1. The rails server starts. 2. A model, e.g. `User`, calls the `audited` method, that adds the `users_auditing_enabled` key to the store. 3. A request is received, the key `users_auditing_enabled` is fetched from the store, in order to check the audit is enabled for that class. 4. The request is served, the store is cleared and all future requests will fail to fetch `users_auditing_enabled` from the store. 5. Failing to fetch the key defaults to true, so disabling auditing is not possible.   I tried checking out the branch for [#673](https://github.com/collectiveidea/audited/pull/673) that uses `ActiveSupport::CurrentAttributes` and the result is the same, because in this case the store is cleared after and before every request [[Docs](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/activesupport/lib/active_support/current_attributes.rb#L10-L12)]  When the store is cleared, it's remains cleared for the remaining life of the scope, which can be a `Thread` or a `Process` depending on the server being used, configuration, etc. I tested this locally using Unicorn with two workers. In this case the server uses only one thread and spawns to processes, one for each worker. Only the first request attended by each worker gets the store correctly. The problem is this will be different for different servers and configs.  In order to fix this issue, I think it's OK to remove keys like `:audited_user` or `:current_user` after every request, but `"#{table_name}_auditing_enabled"` keys should be kept between requests. |

url: https://github.com/collectiveidea/audited/security/advisories/GHSA-hjp3-5g2q-7jww
title: Race Condition leading to logging errors
date: 2023-05-01
description: |
In certain setups with threaded web servers, Audited's use of
`Thread.current` can incorrectly attributed audits to the wrong user.
Fixed in 5.3.3.
In March, @convisoappsec noticed that the library in question had a
Race Condition problem, which caused logs to be registered at times
with different users than those who performed the genuine actions.
- The first issue we identified was from November
2021: https://github.com/collectiveidea/audited/issues/601
- So the solution was implemented in the following Pull Request:
https://github.com/collectiveidea/audited/pull/669
- And the feature was published in version 5.3.3:
RELEASE: https://github.com/collectiveidea/audited/pull/671
cvss\_v3: 3.1
unaffected\_versions:
- "< 4.0.0"
patched\_versions:
- ">= 5.3.3"

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

### **[mroach](/mroach)** commented [Apr 26, 2023](#issuecomment-1522891784)

| What's the motivation with using another gem as opposed to [ActiveSupport::CurrentAttributes](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/CurrentAttributes.html)? My understanding of `CurrentAttributes` is that it's designed specifically to deal with this problem, and it's already available due to the indirect dependency via `ActiveRecord`. |

[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-hjp3-5g2q-7jww/dependabot)

## Package

bundler

audited
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

>= 4.0.0, < 5.3.3

## Patched versions

5.3.3

## Description

In certain setups with threaded web servers, Audited's use of `Thread.current` can incorrectly attributed audits to the wrong user.

Fixed in 5.3.3.

In March, [@convisoappsec](https://github.com/convisoappsec) noticed that the library in question had a Race Condition problem, which caused logs to be registered at times with different users than those who performed the genuine actions.

* The first issue we identified was from November 2021: [collectiveidea/audited#601](https://github.com/collectiveidea/audited/issues/601)
* So the solution was implemented in the following Pull Request: [collectiveidea/audited#669](https://github.com/collectiveidea/audited/pull/669)
* And the feature was published in version 5.3.3: RELEASE: [collectiveidea/audited#671](https://github.com/collectiveidea/audited/pull/671)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Audited [Gem Version](http://rubygems.org/gems/audited) [Build Status](https://github.com/collectiveidea/audited/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg) [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/collectiveidea/audited) [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/testdouble/standard)

**Audited** (previously acts\_as\_audited) is an ORM extension that logs all changes to your models. Audited can also record who made those changes, save comments and associate models related to the changes.

Audited currently (5.6) works with Rails 7.2, 7.1, 7.0, 6.1, 6.0, 5.2.

For Rails 5.0 & 5.1, use gem version 5.4.3
For Rails 4, use gem version 4.x
For Rails 3, use gem version 3.0 or see the [3.0-stable branch](https://github.com/collectiveidea/audited/tree/3.0-stable).

## Supported Rubies

Audited supports and is [tested against](https://github.com/collectiveidea/audited/actions/workflows/ci.yml) the following Ruby versions:

* 2.3 (only tested on Sqlite due to testing issues with other DBs)
* 2.4
* 2.5
* 2.6
* 2.7
* 3.0
* 3.1
* 3.2
* 3.3

Audited may work just fine with a Ruby version not listed above, but we can't guarantee that it will. If you'd like to maintain a Ruby that isn't listed, please let us know with a [pull request](https://github.com/collectiveidea/audited/pulls).

## Supported ORMs

Audited is currently ActiveRecord-only. In a previous life, Audited worked with MongoMapper. Use the [4.2-stable branch](https://github.com/collectiveidea/audited/tree/4.2-stable) if you need MongoMapper.

## Installation

Add the gem to your Gemfile:

```
gem "audited"
```

And if you're using `require: false` you must add initializers like this:

```
#./config/initializers/audited.rb
require "audited"

Audited::Railtie.initializers.each(&:run)
```

Then, from your Rails app directory, create the `audits` table:

```
$ rails generate audited:install
$ rake db:migrate
```

By default changes are stored in YAML format. If you're using PostgreSQL, then you can use `rails generate audited:install --audited-changes-column-type jsonb` (or `json` for MySQL 5.7+ and Rails 5+) to store audit changes natively with database JSON column types.

If you're using something other than integer primary keys (e.g. UUID) for your User model, then you can use `rails generate audited:install --audited-user-id-column-type uuid` to customize the `audits` table `user_id` column type.

#### Upgrading

If you're already using Audited (or acts\_as\_audited), your `audits` table may require additional columns. After every upgrade, please run:

```
$ rails generate audited:upgrade
$ rake db:migrate
```

Upgrading will only make changes if changes are needed.

## Usage

Simply call `audited` on your models:

```
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  audited
end
```

By default, whenever a user is created, updated or destroyed, a new audit is created.

```
user = User.create!(name: "Steve")
user.audits.count # => 1
user.update!(name: "Ryan")
user.audits.count # => 2
user.destroy
user.audits.count # => 3
```

Audits contain information regarding what action was taken on the model and what changes were made.

```
user.update!(name: "Ryan")
audit = user.audits.last
audit.action # => "update"
audit.audited_changes # => {"name"=>["Steve", "Ryan"]}
```

You can get previous versions of a record by index or date, or list all
revisions.

```
user.revisions
user.revision(1)
user.revision_at(Date.parse("2016-01-01"))
```

### Specifying columns

By default, a new audit is created for any attribute changes. You can, however, limit the columns to be considered.

```
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  # All fields
  # audited

  # Single field
  # audited only: :name

  # Multiple fields
  # audited only: [:name, :address]

  # All except certain fields
  # audited except: :password
end
```

### Specifying callbacks

By default, a new audit is created for any Create, Update, Touch (Rails 6+) or Destroy action. You can, however, limit the actions audited.

```
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  # All fields and actions
  # audited

  # Single field, only audit Update and Destroy (not Create or Touch)
  # audited only: :name, on: [:update, :destroy]
end
```

You can ignore the default callbacks globally unless the callback action is specified in your model using the `:on` option. To configure default callback exclusion, put the following in an initializer file (`config/initializers/audited.rb`):

```
Audited.ignored_default_callbacks = [:create, :update] # ignore callbacks create and update
```

### Comments

You can attach comments to each audit using an `audit_comment` attribute on your model.

```
user.update!(name: "Ryan", audit_comment: "Changing name, just because")
user.audits.last.comment # => "Changing name, just because"
```

You can optionally add the `:comment_required` option to your `audited` call to require comments for all audits.

```
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  audited :comment_required => true
end
```

You can update an audit only if audit\_comment is present. You can optionally add the `:update_with_comment_only` option set to `false` to your `audited` call to turn this behavior off for all audits.

```
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  audited :update_with_comment_only => false
end
```

### Limiting stored audits

You can limit the number of audits stored for your model. To configure limiting for all audited models, put the following in an initializer file (`config/initializers/audited.rb`):

```
Audited.max_audits = 10 # keep only 10 latest audits
```

or customize per model:

```
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  audited max_audits: 2
end
```

Whenever an object is updated or destroyed, extra audits are combined with newer ones and the old ones are destroyed.

```
user = User.create!(name: "Steve")
user.audits.count # => 1
user.update!(name: "Ryan")
user.audits.count # => 2
user.destroy
user.audits.count # => 2
```

### Current User Tracking

If you're using Audited in a Rails application, all audited changes made within a request will automatically be attributed to the current user. By default, Audited uses the `current_user` method in your controller.

```
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    current_user # => #<User name: "Steve">
    @post = Post.create(params[:post])
    @post.audits.last.user # => #<User name: "Steve">
  end
end
```

To use a method other than `current_user`, put the following in an initializer file (`config/initializers/audited.rb`):

```
Audited.current_user_method = :authenticated_user
```

Outside of a request, Audited can still record the user with the `as_user` method:

```
Audited.audit_class.as_user(User.find(1)) do
  post.update!(title: "Hello, world!")
end
post.audits.last.user # => #<User id: 1>
```

The standard Audited install assumes your User model has an integer primary key type. If this isn't true (e.g. you're using UUID primary keys), you'll need to create a migration to update the `audits` table `user_id` column type. (See Installation above for generator flags if you'd like to regenerate the install migration.)

#### Custom Audit User

You might need to use a custom auditor from time to time. This can be done by simply passing in a string:

```
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  def authenticated_user
    if current_user
      current_user
    else
      'Alexander Fleming'
    end
  end
end
```

`as_user` also accepts a string, which can be useful for auditing updates made in a CLI environment:

```
Audited.audit_class.as_user("console-user-#{ENV['SSH_USER']}") do
  post.update_attributes!(title: "Hello, world!")
end
post.audits.last.user # => 'console-user-username'
```

If you want to set a specific user as the auditor of the commands in a CLI environment, whether that is a string or an ActiveRecord object, you can use the following command:

```
Audited.store[:audited_user] = "username"

# or

Audited.store[:audited_user] = User.find(1)
```

### Associated Audits

Sometimes it's useful to associate an audit with a model other than the one being changed. For instance, given the following models:

```
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :company
  audited
end

class Company < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :users
end
```

Every change to a user is audited, but what if you want to grab all of the audits of users belonging to a particular company? You can add the `:associated_with` option to your `audited` call:

```
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :company
  audited associated_with: :company
end

class Company < ActiveRecord::Base
  audited
  has_many :users
  has_associated_audits
end
```

Now, when an audit is created for a user, that user's company is also saved alongside the audit. This makes it much easier (and faster) to access audits indirectly related to a company.

```
company = Company.create!(name: "Collective Idea")
user = company.users.create!(name: "Steve")
user.update!(name: "Steve Richert")
user.audits.last.associated # => #<Company name: "Collective Idea">
company.associated_audits.last.auditable # => #<User name: "Steve Richert">
```

You can access records' own audits and associated audits in one go:

```
company.own_and_associated_audits
```

### Conditional auditing

If you want to audit only under specific conditions, you can provide conditional options (similar to ActiveModel callbacks) that will ensure your model is only audited for these conditions.

```
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  audited if: :active?

  def active?
    last_login > 6.months.ago
  end
end
```

Just like in ActiveModel, you can use an inline Proc in your conditions:

```
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  audited unless: Proc.new { |u| u.ninja? }
end
```

In the above case, the user will only be audited when `User#ninja` is `false`.

### Disabling auditing

If you want to disable auditing temporarily doing certain tasks, there are a few
methods available.

To disable auditing on a save:

```
@user.save_without_auditing
```

or:

```
@user.without_auditing do
  @user.save
end
```

To disable auditing on a column:

```
User.non_audited_columns = [:first_name, :last_name]
```

To disable auditing on an entire model:

```
User.auditing_enabled = false
```

To disable auditing on all models:

```
Audited.auditing_enabled = false
```

If you have auditing disabled by default on your model you can enable auditing
temporarily.

```
User.auditing_enabled = false
@user.save_with_auditing
```

or:

```
User.auditing_enabled = false
@user.with_auditing do
  @user.save
end
```

### Encrypted attributes

If you're using ActiveRecord's encryption (available from Rails 7) to encrypt some attributes, Audited will automatically filter values of these attributes. No additional configuration is required. Changes to encrypted attributes will be logged as `[FILTERED]`.

```
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  audited
  encrypts :password
end
```

### Custom `Audit` model

If you want to extend or modify the audit model, create a new class that
inherits from `Audited::Audit`:

```
class CustomAudit < Audited::Audit
  def some_custom_behavior
    "Hiya!"
  end
end
```

Then set it in an initializer:

```
# config/initializers/audited.rb

Audited.config do |config|
  config.audit_class = "CustomAudit"
end
```

### Enum Storage

In 4.10, the default behavior for enums changed from storing the value synthesized by Rails to the value stored in the DB. You can restore the previous behavior by setting the store\_synthesized\_enums configuration value:

```
# config/initializers/audited.rb

Audited.store_synthesized_enums = true
```
