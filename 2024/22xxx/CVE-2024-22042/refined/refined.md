- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect use of privileged APIs within the Windows installer agent of Unicam FX. This leads to the Windows Console Host (conhost.exe) being spawned as a child process with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect use of privileged APIs (CWE-648)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to achieve local privilege escalation, gaining SYSTEM privileges on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have low-level privileges on the system where the vulnerable software is installed. They must be able to execute code on the local machine. No user interaction is required.
