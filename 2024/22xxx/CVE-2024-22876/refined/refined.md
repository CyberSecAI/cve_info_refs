- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue stemming from the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input within the attachment preview functionality of TheHive. Specifically, it is caused by the ability to upload malicious HTML files containing JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core weakness is the presence of a stored XSS vulnerability. This is further characterized by the application's failure to sanitize or properly handle malicious HTML files uploaded as attachments.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to session hijacking and privilege escalation. An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's session. This malicious code could then be used to manipulate the victim's account, perform actions without authorization, or elevate privileges of another user.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves uploading a malicious HTML file containing JavaScript code through the attachment functionality. Then, accessing the attachment preview through the provided URL executes the malicious script within the victim's session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to upload attachments to TheHive and the knowledge of how to craft a malicious HTML file with JavaScript to trigger the vulnerability.
