# User profile page vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

Moderate

[DogukanUrker](/DogukanUrker)
published
GHSA-mrcw-j96f-p6v6
Jun 16, 2023

## Package

flaskBlog
(Python)

## Affected versions

Master branch

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Summary

Improper storage and rendering of the `/user/<user>` page allows a user's comments to execute arbitrary javascript code.

### Details

The html template `user.html` contains the following code snippet to render comments made by a user:

`<div class="content" tag="content">{{comment[2]|safe}}</div>`

Use of the "safe" tag causes flask to *not* escape the rendered content.

To remediate this, simply remove the `|safe` tag from the HTML above.

### PoC

1. Make a post as a user
2. Leave a comment on the post containing: `<script>alert(1);</script>`
3. Browse to your profile page and notice the popup

### Impact

Classic cross site scripting vulnerability affecting users who visit the profile of a poster who's post contains scripted comments. It may be possible to write a self-replicating payload to spread this comment like a worm across other profiles.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-22414

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
