Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-22428:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from "Incorrect Default Permissions" within the Dell iDRAC Service Module for Windows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The iDRAC Service Module, specifically versions 5.2.0.0 and prior, has incorrect default folder permissions.
- This incorrect configuration allows a local, unprivileged user to potentially gain elevated privileges on the affected system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit allows a local unprivileged user to escalate privileges.
- This privilege escalation can further lead to arbitrary code execution on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have local access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user on the system.
- They do not need to be an administrator or have special privileges.
- The attacker does not need user interaction (UI:N).
- The attack complexity is considered high (AC:H)

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is only applicable if the iDRAC Service Module is installed in a custom location other than `C:\Program Files\Dell\SysMgt`.
- The vulnerability does not affect the Linux version of the iDRAC Service Module or the iDRAC Service Module ViB for ESXi.
- Dell recommends upgrading to iDRAC Service Module for Windows versions 5.3.0.0, 5.2.0.0 and 5.1.0.0 or later.
