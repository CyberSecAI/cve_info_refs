Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in the `/system/site/filterKeyword_save` endpoint of FlyCms v1.0.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of proper CSRF mitigation mechanisms. This allows an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
* **Impact of Exploitation:** By successfully exploiting the CSRF vulnerability, an attacker can manipulate the application's state by adding keywords. This can lead to unwanted configurations within the system, and potentially more severe issues depending on the functionality associated with this endpoint and any follow-on actions.
* **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious HTML page (as shown in the provided PoC). This page, when visited by an authenticated user of the vulnerable FlyCms application, will trigger a forged request to `/system/site/filterKeyword_save`.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to:
    1.  Have knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint `/system/site/filterKeyword_save`.
    2.  Be able to trick an authenticated user into visiting a malicious webpage or otherwise injecting the crafted form.
    3.  The attacker does not need to be logged in themselves, or have access to the FlyCms system.

The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) HTML demonstrates how an attacker can exploit the vulnerability. The PoC includes a form that, when submitted by a victim who is already logged into the vulnerable system, will send a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint, adding "csss" as a keyword. The provided screenshots appear to confirm the successful exploitation of this vulnerability.
