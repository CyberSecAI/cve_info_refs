- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The SimpleMap Store Locator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts (such as redirects, advertisements, or other HTML payloads) into the website. When a user visits the site, these scripts will be executed in their browser, potentially leading to various attacks, including account hijacking or further malware injection.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through injecting malicious scripts via user input. The specific vulnerable input locations are not specified in this document.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
