Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The PeepSo Core: Photos plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  The plugin is susceptible to XSS attacks, which allows the injection of malicious scripts into the website.
-  The injected scripts can execute when other users visit the affected pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Successful exploitation can lead to the injection of malicious scripts, potentially including:
    -  Redirects to malicious websites.
    -  Display of unwanted advertisements.
    -  Other malicious HTML payloads.
-  This could compromise the security and integrity of the website and potentially lead to further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  The vulnerability is triggered when a user visits the website page where the malicious script was injected.
-  The attacker would need to inject the malicious code into the plugin. The exact mechanism for injection is not specified in the provided content but it is likely through a user-controlled input that is not properly sanitized.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into the plugin.
-  The attacker needs to have at least 'subscriber' level privileges on the WordPress site, which suggests the attack likely involves a user-submitted input (e.g., in a comment or profile field).
