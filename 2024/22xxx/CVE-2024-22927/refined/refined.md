- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-controlled parameters within a JWT, leading to reflected XSS vulnerabilities. Specifically, the `info` parameter within the upload form, which is derived from the JWT header, is directly rendered on the page without proper sanitization. Additionally, the application incorrectly handles URL encoding/decoding, requiring "+" instead of "-" after JWT encryption, suggesting a flawed implementation of URL processing logic.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Reflected XSS: Multiple parameters within the JWT header (`num`, `input`, `path`, `func`, `is_water`) can be manipulated to inject malicious JavaScript code, resulting in reflected XSS vulnerabilities.
    - Improper URL encoding/decoding: The application incorrectly handles URL encoding/decoding, accepting "+" instead of "-" after JWT encryption. This indicates a lack of understanding of URL encoding/decoding best practices and security implications.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Cookie theft: If an administrator accesses a malicious URL, their session cookies can be stolen, leading to account compromise and unauthorized access to the application.
    - Arbitrary JavaScript execution: Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser, potentially leading to further attacks.

- **Attack vectors:**
    - Maliciously crafted URLs: The attacker constructs a URL with a modified JWT payload containing malicious JavaScript within the header parameters. This URL is then sent to the victim, usually an administrator.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Ability to manipulate the JWT header: The attacker needs to be able to modify the JWT header parameters.
    - Ability to construct and deliver malicious URLs: The attacker must be able to craft and send malicious URLs to the victim.
    - Victim needs to be an authenticated administrator.
