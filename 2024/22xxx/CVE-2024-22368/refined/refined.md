Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-22368

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the `Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX` Perl module handles merged cells in XLSX files. The module uses a memoization technique to save the merged state for each cell within a merged area. However, the size of a merged cell is not constrained, allowing an attacker to define a huge merged cell, which results in excessive memory allocation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-memory vulnerability:** The module lacks proper validation or limits on the size of merged cell definitions.
- **Inefficient memory management:** The memoization technique used for merged cells is resource-intensive for large merged areas, causing the program to allocate excessive memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing a crafted XLSX file with a large merged cell definition, an attacker can force the server to allocate a huge amount of memory, leading to memory exhaustion, swapping, and ultimately crashing the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious XLSX file:** An attacker crafts an XLSX file containing a large merged cell definition.
- **File upload:** The attacker uploads or provides the malicious XLSX file to a service that utilizes the vulnerable `Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX` module for parsing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide a crafted XLSX file:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the vulnerable service with a crafted XLSX file. This can be achieved through various means, like web-based file uploads, email attachments, etc.
- **No special privileges:** The vulnerability does not require any special privileges to exploit.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in `Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX` versions 0.27 and earlier.
- The vulnerable code is primarily located in the `_parse_sheet` subroutine, specifically in how it parses `<mergeCell>` elements and the `_cell_to_row_col` subroutine which converts cell references to row and column numbers.
- The Proof of Concept (PoC) involves adding a `<mergeCell>` element with a large `ref` attribute (e.g., `A1:ZZZZ9999`) inside the `<worksheet>` tag within `xl/worksheets/sheet1.xml`.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by either setting a limit on the range inside the `_cell_to_row_col` subroutine or using a different method to handle merged cells, instead of preemptively marking all cells within the merged area.
- The fix for this vulnerability is included in version 0.28 and later of the `Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX` module.
- This vulnerability is a separate issue from the Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) vulnerability found in `Spreadsheet::ParseExcel` (CVE-2023-7101).
- While this vulnerability was not known to be used in production it could be exploited to cause a denial of service on web applications and other services that use the vulnerable perl module.
