{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `setNetworkCardInfo` function in Vinchin Backup and Recovery software directly concatenates user-supplied input (`NAME` parameter) into a system command, without proper sanitization or validation. Specifically, it constructs a file path using the `NAME` parameter and then uses it in a `cat` command executed via `exec()`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Command Injection",
    "Insufficient input validation",
    "Use of `exec()` with unsanitized user input"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary commands via the `NAME` parameter that will be executed by the system with the privileges of the web server's process, potentially leading to complete system compromise, including remote code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a POST request to the `/api/` endpoint with the `m=8` and `f=setNetworkCardInfo` parameters, an attacker can include malicious commands in the `NAME` parameter of the request's `p` JSON payload.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the Vinchin Backup and Recovery server, including valid session cookies."
