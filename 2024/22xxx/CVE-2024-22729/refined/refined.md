- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of the "password" parameter in the Netis MW5360 router's web interface, specifically within the `skk_set.cgi` script. The router's login page authorization can be bypassed by deleting the authorization header.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Blind command injection vulnerability. The "password" parameter in the HTTP POST request is vulnerable to command injection via base64 encoding.

- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the device, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control of the router, severely affecting its operational integrity and compromising network security.

- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to `/cgi-bin/skk_set.cgi` with a base64 encoded command injection payload in the `password` parameter.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router's web interface. They don't need to be authenticated as the authentication can be bypassed.
