The provided content relates to CVE-2024-22601.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in FlyCms v1.0, specifically within the `/system/score/scorerule_save` component.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application lacks sufficient CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can steal user identities and send malicious requests, such as simulating users sending emails, messages, payments, or transfers. This can lead to unauthorized actions being performed by the victim user without their consent.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTML page (PoC) that, when loaded in the victim's browser while they are authenticated to the vulnerable application, submits a forged request to `/system/score/scorerule_save`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user of the vulnerable application into opening a malicious page (e.g. via phishing), that will automatically submit a forged request to the vulnerable endpoint. The attacker does not need to be logged in to the application; they just need to trick a user who is already logged in.
