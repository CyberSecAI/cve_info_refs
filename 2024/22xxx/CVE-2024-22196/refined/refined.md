Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-22196:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `OrderAndPaginate` function in the `nginx-ui` application constructs SQL queries using user-provided input without proper sanitization. Specifically, the `sort_by` and `order` query parameters are directly incorporated into the SQL `ORDER BY` clause.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in the `order` and `sort_by` parameters, which are used to construct the `ORDER BY` clause in SQL queries. This allows attackers to manipulate the database queries by injecting malicious SQL code through these parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can retrieve arbitrary data from the database by crafting malicious `sort_by` parameters that inject SQL code, modifying the query logic and potentially exposing sensitive information.
- The vulnerability is also described as enabling an attacker to order the response in a specific way, making it possible to infer information based on how the data is ordered.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered via HTTP GET requests to API endpoints that use the vulnerable `OrderAndPaginate` function.
- **Query Parameters:**  The attacker injects SQL code via the `sort_by` and `order` query parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application to exploit the vulnerability, as the affected endpoints appear to be protected by JWT authentication.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the application to send the malicious HTTP requests.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes a proof of concept (PoC) demonstrating how an attacker can exploit the vulnerability using a crafted HTTP request.
- The fix for this vulnerability involves validating the `order` and `sort_by` parameters against the database schema to prevent SQL injection. The patch ensures that only valid database column names are used for ordering.
