      "source": "securitylab.github.com_6010e15e_20250114_190609.html",
      "root_cause": "The `window` endpoint in `app/routes.py` does not sanitize user-supplied input from the `location` variable and passes it to the `send` method, leading to a server-side request forgery.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
      ],
      "impact": "Allows crafting GET requests to internal and external resources on behalf of the server, potentially accessing internal network resources not publicly accessible.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "The attacker crafts a malicious URL with the `location` parameter to target internal or external resources. This URL is then processed by the vulnerable `window` endpoint."
      ],
