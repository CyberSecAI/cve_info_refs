Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-22213:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the way the Nextcloud Deck application handles user-provided HTML content within comments. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize or escape HTML input, leading to a potential self-XSS issue.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Self-Cross-Site Scripting (Self-XSS):** The application allows users to inject and execute arbitrary HTML, including JavaScript, within their own browser session when viewing comments.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker cannot directly exploit other users. However, a user can be tricked into executing malicious code in their own browser by crafting a malicious HTML comment.
- This could lead to actions performed by the user under their own session without their knowledge.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would need to craft a comment containing malicious HTML/JavaScript and convince the victim to view it. This is a form of social engineering.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create a comment within the Nextcloud Deck application.
- No specific privileges are required.
- The attack requires some form of user interaction (victim has to view the crafted comment).

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is rated as low severity.
- The affected versions are >= 1.9.0 and >= 1.10.0.
- The patched versions are 1.9.5 and 1.11.2.
- The CVSS score is 0.0, which seems to be an error in the reporting and should be taken with caution. The individual metrics indicate a base score would likely be more significant.
- The pull request ([https://github.com/nextcloud/deck/pull/5294](https://github.com/nextcloud/deck/pull/5294)) indicates a fix has been implemented.
- The fix involves using the `textContent` property, which extracts the text and removes HTML tags.
