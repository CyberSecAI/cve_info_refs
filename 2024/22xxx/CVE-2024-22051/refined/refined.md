      "Integer overflow leading to heap memory corruption"

    "impact": "Heap memory corruption leading to potential Information Leak or Arbitrary Code Execution, and potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE) if vulnerable versions of CommonMarker are used to render user-controlled markdown.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Parsing of markdown tables with more than `UINT16_MAX` columns in the marker row.",
        "Specifically, this happens in the `table.c:row_from_string` function of `cmark-gfm`"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a malicious markdown document containing a table with more than `UINT16_MAX` columns in the marker row to trigger the overflow. This could be achieved through a malicious website, email, or other medium which utilizes the vulnerable library to render markdown. No user interaction is required."

The vulnerability was reported by Felix Wilhelm of Google's Project Zero. The fix involves checking for integer overflows when parsing table rows and limiting column counts."
