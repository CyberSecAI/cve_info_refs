The provided content relates to CVE-2024-22402.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of request URLs within the Guests app for Nextcloud. Specifically, the application does not properly decode URLs before checking against the app allowlist.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper URL decoding
- Inadequate access control enforcement.
- CWE-177: Improper Handling of URL Encoding.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Guest users were able to bypass the app allowlist and access pages of apps that they were not explicitly permitted to use. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access to data and functionalities within those apps.

**Attack vectors:**
Network based. An attacker, as a guest user, could craft a malicious URL to bypass access controls.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be a guest user within the Nextcloud instance.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs with specific encoding to bypass access control.
