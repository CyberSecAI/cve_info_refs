The content relates to CVE-2024-22208.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The phpMyFAQ application's "sharing FAQ" functionality allows unauthenticated users to send emails with arbitrary content and links to multiple recipients. The application does not properly limit the number of emails sent, despite a CAPTCHA being in place.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of input validation/sanitization: The application doesn't properly sanitize or validate the email addresses provided by the user, allowing for an arbitrary number of recipients to be included.
- Unrestricted email sending: The application's backend does not enforce the limit of 5 email addresses, allowing an attacker to send emails to an unlimited number of recipients with a single request.
- Lack of content control: The application allows the attacker to control the link and content of the emails, making it possible to send phishing emails.
- Unauthenticated access: The "share FAQ" functionality can be accessed by any unauthenticated user.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Phishing: An attacker can send phishing emails to a large number of recipients.
- Reputational damage: The email server of the target application may be blacklisted due to sending spam, causing all emails to end up in spam.
- Resource abuse: The application's email server can be abused to send a large volume of emails, which can lead to resource exhaustion.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any authentication to perform the attack.
- The attacker only needs to have access to the application's "share FAQ" functionality.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP requests with an arbitrary number of email recipients and malicious content to the share feature endpoint.

**Additional details:**
The provided commit log shows the fix for this vulnerability:
- A check was added to the backend to limit the number of email addresses to 5.
- The ability for a user to change the URL is removed.
