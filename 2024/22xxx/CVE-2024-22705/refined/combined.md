Revert "platform/x86: p2sb: Allow p2sb\_bar() calls during PCI device probe"
commit b20712e853305cbd04673f02b7e52ba5b12c11a9 upstream.
This reverts commit b28ff7a7c3245d7f62acc20f15b4361292fe4117.
The commit introduced P2SB device scan and resource cache during the
boot process to avoid deadlock. But it caused detection failure of
IDE controllers on old systems [1]. The IDE controllers on old systems
and P2SB devices on newer systems have same PCI DEVFN. It is suspected
the confusion between those two is the failure cause. Revert the change
at this moment until the proper solution gets ready.

wifi: nl80211: fix deadlock in nl80211\_set\_cqm\_rssi (6.6.x)
Commit 008afb9f3d57 ("wifi: cfg80211: fix CQM for non-range use"
backported to 6.6.x) causes nl80211\_set\_cqm\_rssi not to release the
wdev lock in some of the error paths.
Of course, the ensuing deadlock causes userland network managers to
break pretty badly, and on typical systems this also causes lockups on
on suspend, poweroff and reboot. See [1], [2], [3] for example reports.
The upstream commit 7e7efdda6adb ("wifi: cfg80211: fix CQM for non-range
use"), committed in November 2023, is completely fine because there was
another commit in August 2023 that removed the wdev lock:
see commit 076fc8775daf ("wifi: cfg80211: remove wdev mutex").
The reason things broke in 6.6.5 is that commit 4338058f6009 was applied
without also applying 076fc8775daf.
Commit 076fc8775daf ("wifi: cfg80211: remove wdev mutex") is a rather
large commit; adjusting the error handling (which is what this commit does)
yields a much simpler patch and was tested to work properly.
Fix the deadlock by releasing the lock before returning.

for details]
My prior race fix here broke CQM when ranges aren't used, as
the reporting worker now requires the cqm\_config to be set in
the wdev, but isn't set when there's no range configured.
Rather than continuing to special-case the range version, set
the cqm\_config always and configure accordingly, also tracking
if range was used or not to be able to clear the configuration
appropriately with the same API, which was actually not right
if both were implemented by a driver for some reason, as is
the case with mac80211 (though there the implementations are
equivalent so it doesn't matter.)
Also, the original multiple-RSSI commit lost checking for the
callback, so might have potentially crashed if a driver had
neither implementation, and userspace tried to use it despite
not being advertised as supported.

tracing: Fix blocked reader of snapshot buffer
commit 39a7dc23a1ed0fe81141792a09449d124c5953bd upstream.
If an application blocks on the snapshot or snapshot\_raw files, expecting
to be woken up when a snapshot occurs, it will not happen. Or it may
happen with an unexpected result.
That result is that the application will be reading the main buffer
instead of the snapshot buffer. That is because when the snapshot occurs,
the main and snapshot buffers are swapped. But the reader has a descriptor
still pointing to the buffer that it originally connected to.
This is fine for the main buffer readers, as they may be blocked waiting
for a watermark to be hit, and when a snapshot occurs, the data that the
main readers want is now on the snapshot buffer.
But for waiters of the snapshot buffer, they are waiting for an event to
occur that will trigger the snapshot and they can then consume it quickly
to save the snapshot before the next snapshot occurs. But to do this, they
need to read the new snapshot buffer, not the old one that is now
receiving new data.
Also, it does not make sense to have a watermark "buffer\_percent" on the
snapshot buffer, as the snapshot buffer is static and does not receive new
data except all at once.

ftrace: Fix modification of direct\_function hash while in use
commit d05cb470663a2a1879277e544f69e660208f08f2 upstream.
Masami Hiramatsu reported a memory leak in register\_ftrace\_direct() where
if the number of new entries are added is large enough to cause two
allocations in the loop:
for (i = 0; i < size; i++) {
hlist\_for\_each\_entry(entry, &hash->buckets[i], hlist) {
new = ftrace\_add\_rec\_direct(entry->ip, addr, &free\_hash);
if (!new)
goto out\_remove;
entry->direct = addr;
}
}
Where ftrace\_add\_rec\_direct() has:
if (ftrace\_hash\_empty(direct\_functions) ||
direct\_functions->count > 2 \* (1 << direct\_functions->size\_bits)) {
struct ftrace\_hash \*new\_hash;
int size = ftrace\_hash\_empty(direct\_functions) ? 0 :
direct\_functions->count + 1;
if (size < 32)
size = 32;
new\_hash = dup\_hash(direct\_functions, size);
if (!new\_hash)
return NULL;
\*free\_hash = direct\_functions;
direct\_functions = new\_hash;
}
The "\*free\_hash = direct\_functions;" can happen twice, losing the previous
allocation of direct\_functions.
But this also exposed a more serious bug.
The modification of direct\_functions above is not safe. As
direct\_functions can be referenced at any time to find what direct caller
it should call, the time between:
new\_hash = dup\_hash(direct\_functions, size);
and
direct\_functions = new\_hash;
can have a race with another CPU (or even this one if it gets interrupted),
and the entries being moved to the new hash are not referenced.
That's because the "dup\_hash()" is really misnamed and is really a
"move\_hash()". It moves the entries from the old hash to the new one.
Now even if that was changed, this code is not proper as direct\_functions
should not be updated until the end. That is the best way to handle
function reference changes, and is the way other parts of ftrace handles
this.
The following is done:
1. Change add\_hash\_entry() to return the entry it created and inserted
into the hash, and not just return success or not.
2. Replace ftrace\_add\_rec\_direct() with add\_hash\_entry(), and remove
the former.
3. Allocate a "new\_hash" at the start that is made for holding both the
new hash entries as well as the existing entries in direct\_functions.
4. Copy (not move) the direct\_function entries over to the new\_hash.
5. Copy the entries of the added hash to the new\_hash.
6. If everything succeeds, then use rcu\_pointer\_assign() to update the
direct\_functions with the new\_hash.
This simplifies the code and fixes both the memory leak as well as the
race condition mentioned above.

ring-buffer: Fix wake ups when buffer\_percent is set to 100
commit 623b1f896fa8a669a277ee5a258307a16c7377a3 upstream.
The tracefs file "buffer\_percent" is to allow user space to set a
water-mark on how much of the tracing ring buffer needs to be filled in
order to wake up a blocked reader.
0 - is to wait until any data is in the buffer
1 - is to wait for 1% of the sub buffers to be filled
50 - would be half of the sub buffers are filled with data
100 - is not to wake the waiter until the ring buffer is completely full
Unfortunately the test for being full was:
dirty = ring\_buffer\_nr\_dirty\_pages(buffer, cpu);
return (dirty \* 100) > (full \* nr\_pages);
Where "full" is the value for "buffer\_percent".
There is two issues with the above when full == 100.
1. dirty \* 100 > 100 \* nr\_pages will never be true
That is, the above is basically saying that if the user sets
buffer\_percent to 100, more pages need to be dirty than exist in the
ring buffer!
2. The page that the writer is on is never considered dirty, as dirty
pages are only those that are full. When the writer goes to a new
sub-buffer, it clears the contents of that sub-buffer.
That is, even if the check was ">=" it would still not be equal as the
most pages that can be considered "dirty" is nr\_pages - 1.
To fix this, add one to dirty and use ">=" in the compare.

mm: migrate high-order folios in swap cache correctly
commit fc346d0a70a13d52fe1c4bc49516d83a42cd7c4c upstream.
Large folios occupy N consecutive entries in the swap cache instead of
using multi-index entries like the page cache. However, if a large folio
is re-added to the LRU list, it can be migrated. The migration code was
not aware of the difference between the swap cache and the page cache and
assumed that a single xas\_store() would be sufficient.
This leaves potentially many stale pointers to the now-migrated folio in
the swap cache, which can lead to almost arbitrary data corruption in the
future. This can also manifest as infinite loops with the RCU read lock
held.

mm/filemap: avoid buffered read/write race to read inconsistent data
commit e2c27b803bb664748e090d99042ac128b3f88d92 upstream.
The following concurrency may cause the data read to be inconsistent with
the data on disk:
cpu1 cpu2
------------------------------|------------------------------
// Buffered write 2048 from 0
ext4\_buffered\_write\_iter
generic\_perform\_write
copy\_page\_from\_iter\_atomic
ext4\_da\_write\_end
ext4\_da\_do\_write\_end
block\_write\_end
\_\_block\_commit\_write
folio\_mark\_uptodate
// Buffered read 4096 from 0 smp\_wmb()
ext4\_file\_read\_iter set\_bit(PG\_uptodate, folio\_flags)
generic\_file\_read\_iter i\_size\_write // 2048
filemap\_read unlock\_page(page)
filemap\_get\_pages
filemap\_get\_read\_batch
folio\_test\_uptodate(folio)
ret = test\_bit(PG\_uptodate, folio\_flags)
if (ret)
smp\_rmb();
// Ensure that the data in page 0-2048 is up-to-date.
// New buffered write 2048 from 2048
ext4\_buffered\_write\_iter
generic\_perform\_write
copy\_page\_from\_iter\_atomic
ext4\_da\_write\_end
ext4\_da\_do\_write\_end
block\_write\_end
\_\_block\_commit\_write
folio\_mark\_uptodate
smp\_wmb()
set\_bit(PG\_uptodate, folio\_flags)
i\_size\_write // 4096
unlock\_page(page)
isize = i\_size\_read(inode) // 4096
// Read the latest isize 4096, but without smp\_rmb(), there may be
// Load-Load disorder resulting in the data in the 2048-4096 range
// in the page is not up-to-date.
copy\_page\_to\_iter
// copyout 4096
In the concurrency above, we read the updated i\_size, but there is no read
barrier to ensure that the data in the page is the same as the i\_size at
this point, so we may copy the unsynchronized page out. Hence adding the
missing read memory barrier to fix this.
This is a Load-Load reordering issue, which only occurs on some weak
mem-ordering architectures (e.g. ARM64, ALPHA), but not on strong
mem-ordering architectures (e.g. X86). And theoretically the problem
doesn't only happen on ext4, filesystems that call filemap\_read() but
don't hold inode lock (e.g. btrfs, f2fs, ubifs ...) will have this
problem, while filesystems with inode lock (e.g. xfs, nfs) won't have
this problem.

selftests: secretmem: floor the memory size to the multiple of page\_size
commit 0aac13add26d546ac74c89d2883b3a5f0fbea039 upstream.
The "locked-in-memory size" limit per process can be non-multiple of
page\_size. The mmap() fails if we try to allocate locked-in-memory with
same size as the allowed limit if it isn't multiple of the page\_size
because mmap() rounds off the memory size to be allocated to next multiple
of page\_size.
Fix this by flooring the length to be allocated with mmap() to the
previous multiple of the page\_size.
This was getting triggered on KernelCI regularly because of different
ulimit settings which wasn't multiple of the page\_size. Find logs
here: https://linux.kernelci.org/test/plan/id/657654bd8e81e654fae13532/
The bug in was present from the time test was first added.

maple\_tree: do not preallocate nodes for slot stores
commit 4249f13c11be8b8b7bf93204185e150c3bdc968d upstream.
mas\_preallocate() defaults to requesting 1 node for preallocation and then
,depending on the type of store, will update the request variable. There
isn't a check for a slot store type, so slot stores are preallocating the
default 1 node. Slot stores do not require any additional nodes, so add a
check for the slot store case that will bypass node\_count\_gfp(). Update
the tests to reflect that slot stores do not require allocations.
User visible effects of this bug include increased memory usage from the
unneeded node that was allocated.

platform/x86: p2sb: Allow p2sb\_bar() calls during PCI device probe
commit b28ff7a7c3245d7f62acc20f15b4361292fe4117 upstream.
p2sb\_bar() unhides P2SB device to get resources from the device. It
guards the operation by locking pci\_rescan\_remove\_lock so that parallel
rescans do not find the P2SB device. However, this lock causes deadlock
when PCI bus rescan is triggered by /sys/bus/pci/rescan. The rescan
locks pci\_rescan\_remove\_lock and probes PCI devices. When PCI devices
call p2sb\_bar() during probe, it locks pci\_rescan\_remove\_lock again.
Hence the deadlock.
To avoid the deadlock, do not lock pci\_rescan\_remove\_lock in p2sb\_bar().
Instead, do the lock at fs\_initcall. Introduce p2sb\_cache\_resources()
for fs\_initcall which gets and caches the P2SB resources. At p2sb\_bar(),
refer the cache and return to the caller.

ksmbd: fix slab-out-of-bounds in smb\_strndup\_from\_utf16()
commit d10c77873ba1e9e6b91905018e29e196fd5f863d upstream.
If ->NameOffset/Length is bigger than ->CreateContextsOffset/Length,
ksmbd\_check\_message doesn't validate request buffer it correctly.
So slab-out-of-bounds warning from calling smb\_strndup\_from\_utf16()
in smb2\_open() could happen. If ->NameLength is non-zero, Set the larger
of the two sums (Name and CreateContext size) as the offset and length of
the data area.

platform/x86/intel/pmc: Move GBE LTR ignore to suspend callback
[ Upstream commit 70681aa0746ae61d7668b9f651221fad5e30c71e ]
Commit 804951203aa5 ("platform/x86:intel/pmc: Combine core\_init() and
core\_configure()") caused a network performance regression due to the GBE
LTR ignore that it added at probe. This was needed in order to allow the
SoC to enter the deepest Package C state. To fix the regression and at
least support PC10 during suspend, move the LTR ignore from probe to the
suspend callback, and enable it again on resume. This solution will allow
PC10 during suspend but restrict Package C entry at runtime to no deeper
than PC8/9 while a network cable it attach to the PCH LAN.

mptcp: fix inconsistent state on fastopen race

The netlink PM can race with fastopen self-connect attempts, shutting
down the first subflow via:
MPTCP\_PM\_CMD\_DEL\_ADDR -> mptcp\_nl\_remove\_id\_zero\_address ->
mptcp\_pm\_nl\_rm\_subflow\_received -> mptcp\_close\_ssk
and transitioning such subflow to FIN\_WAIT1 status before the syn-ack
packet is processed. The MPTCP code does not react to such state change,
leaving the connection in not-fallback status and the subflow handshake
uncompleted, triggering the following splat:

To address the issue, catch the racing subflow state change and
use it to cause the MPTCP fallback. Such fallback is also used to
cause the first subflow state propagation to the msk socket via
mptcp\_set\_connected(). After this change, the first subflow can
additionally propagate the TCP\_FIN\_WAIT1 state, so rename the
helper accordingly.
Finally, if the state propagation is delayed to the msk release
callback, the first subflow can change to a different state in between.
Cache the relevant target state in a new msk-level field and use
such value to update the msk state at release time.

mptcp: refactor sndbuf auto-tuning
[ Upstream commit 8005184fd1ca6aeb3fea36f4eb9463fc1b90c114 ]
The MPTCP protocol account for the data enqueued on all the subflows
to the main socket send buffer, while the send buffer auto-tuning
algorithm set the main socket send buffer size as the max size among
the subflows.
That causes bad performances when at least one subflow is sndbuf
limited, e.g. due to very high latency, as the MPTCP scheduler can't
even fill such buffer.
Change the send-buffer auto-tuning algorithm to compute the main socket
send buffer size as the sum of all the subflows buffer size.

kexec: select CRYPTO from KEXEC\_FILE instead of depending on it
[ Upstream commit e63bde3d9417f8318d6dd0d0fafa35ebf307aabd ]
All other users of crypto code use 'select' instead of 'depends on', so do
the same thing with KEXEC\_FILE for consistency.
In practice this makes very little difference as kernels with kexec
support are very likely to also include some other feature that already
selects both crypto and crypto\_sha256, but being consistent here helps for
usability as well as to avoid potential circular dependencies.
This reverts the dependency back to what it was originally before commit
74ca317c26a3f ("kexec: create a new config option CONFIG\_KEXEC\_FILE for
new syscall"), which changed changed it with the comment "This should be
safer as "select" is not recursive", but that appears to have been done in
error, as "select" is indeed recursive, and there are no other
dependencies that prevent CRYPTO\_SHA256 from being selected here.

kexec: fix KEXEC\_FILE dependencies
[ Upstream commit c1ad12ee0efc07244be37f69311e6f7c4ac98e62 ]
The cleanup for the CONFIG\_KEXEC Kconfig logic accidentally changed the
'depends on CRYPTO=y' dependency to a plain 'depends on CRYPTO', which
causes a link failure when all the crypto support is in a loadable module
and kexec\_file support is built-in:
x86\_64-linux-ld: vmlinux.o: in function `\_\_x64\_sys\_kexec\_file\_load':
(.text+0x32e30a): undefined reference to `crypto\_alloc\_shash'
x86\_64-linux-ld: (.text+0x32e58e): undefined reference to `crypto\_shash\_update'
x86\_64-linux-ld: (.text+0x32e6ee): undefined reference to `crypto\_shash\_final'
Both s390 and x86 have this problem, while ppc64 and riscv have the
correct dependency already. On riscv, the dependency is only used for the
purgatory, not for the kexec\_file code itself, which may be a bit
surprising as it means that with CONFIG\_CRYPTO=m, it is possible to enable
KEXEC\_FILE but then the purgatory code is silently left out.
Move this into the common Kconfig.kexec file in a way that is correct
everywhere, using the dependency on CRYPTO\_SHA256=y only when the
purgatory code is available. This requires reversing the dependency
between ARCH\_SUPPORTS\_KEXEC\_PURGATORY and KEXEC\_FILE, but the effect
remains the same, other than making riscv behave like the other ones.
On s390, there is an additional dependency on CRYPTO\_SHA256\_S390, which
should technically not be required but gives better performance. Remove
this dependency here, noting that it was not present in the initial
Kconfig code but was brought in without an explanation in commit
71406883fd357 ("s390/kexec\_file: Add kexec\_file\_load system call").

fs: cifs: Fix atime update check
[ Upstream commit 01fe654f78fd1ea4df046ef76b07ba92a35f8dbe ]
Commit 9b9c5bea0b96 ("cifs: do not return atime less than mtime") indicates
that in cifs, if atime is less than mtime, some apps will break.
Therefore, it introduce a function to compare this two variables in two
places where atime is updated. If atime is less than mtime, update it to
mtime.
However, the patch was handled incorrectly, resulting in atime and mtime
being exactly equal. A previous commit 69738cfdfa70 ("fs: cifs: Fix atime
update check vs mtime") fixed one place and forgot to fix another. Fix it.

Recently, we converted the ctime accesses in the kernel to use new
accessor functions. Linus recently pointed out though that if we add
accessors for the atime and mtime, then that would allow us to
seamlessly change how these timestamps are stored in the inode.
Add new accessor functions for the atime and mtime that mirror the
accessors for the ctime.

ksmbd: fix missing RDMA-capable flag for IPoIB device in ksmbd\_rdma\_capable\_netdev()
[ Upstream commit ecce70cf17d91c3dd87a0c4ea00b2d1387729701 ]
Physical ib\_device does not have an underlying net\_device, thus its
association with IPoIB net\_device cannot be retrieved via
ops.get\_netdev() or ib\_device\_get\_by\_netdev(). ksmbd reads physical
ib\_device port GUID from the lower 16 bytes of the hardware addresses on
IPoIB net\_device and match its underlying ib\_device using ib\_find\_gid()

ksmbd: reorganize ksmbd\_iov\_pin\_rsp()
[ Upstream commit 1819a904299942b309f687cc0f08b123500aa178 ]
If ksmbd\_iov\_pin\_rsp fail, io vertor should be rollback.
This patch moves memory allocations to before setting the io vector
to avoid rollbacks.

ksmbd: fix slab-out-of-bounds in smb\_strndup\_from\_utf16()If ->NameOffset/Length is bigger than ->CreateContextsOffset/Length,
ksmbd\_check\_message doesn't validate request buffer it correctly.
So slab-out-of-bounds warning from calling smb\_strndup\_from\_utf16()
in smb2\_open() could happen. If ->NameLength is non-zero, Set the larger
of the two sums (Name and CreateContext size) as the offset and length of
the data area.
