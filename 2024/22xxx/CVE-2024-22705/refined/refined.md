Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities, fixes, and related information:

**1. ksmbd: fix slab-out-of-bounds in `smb_strndup_from_utf16()`**

*   **Root Cause:** The `ksmbd_check_message` function did not correctly validate the request buffer when the `NameOffset/Length` was larger than `CreateContextsOffset/Length`. This could lead to a slab-out-of-bounds read in `smb_strndup_from_utf16()` within the `smb2_open()` function.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Slab-out-of-bounds read.

*   **Impact:**  A malicious client could potentially trigger a kernel crash or leak kernel memory by crafting a specific SMB2 create request with carefully chosen offsets and lengths.

*   **Attack Vector:**  A malicious SMB client sending a crafted SMB2 create request to the server.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker must be able to communicate with the ksmbd server.
*   **Fix:** The fix ensures that when `NameLength` is non-zero, the larger of the two sums (Name and CreateContext size) is set as the offset and length of the data area.

**2. wifi: nl80211: fix deadlock in `nl80211_set_cqm_rssi`**
*   **Root Cause:**  A backported commit introduced a lock in the error path of `nl80211_set_cqm_rssi` without the corresponding unlock, causing a deadlock when a user-space application manages WiFi.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Deadlock
*   **Impact:** The deadlock can cause system lockups, especially during suspend, poweroff or reboot.
*   **Attack Vector:** Triggering a specific error condition while a user-space application attempts to configure WiFi settings.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to configure wifi settings
*   **Fix:** The fix ensures the wdev lock is released before returning from the error path, preventing the deadlock.

**3. tracing: Fix blocked reader of snapshot buffer**
*   **Root Cause:**  An application blocking on the snapshot buffer would not receive the new data after a snapshot because the descriptor was pointing to the old buffer
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** A blocked reader may read the main buffer instead of the snapshot buffer.
*   **Impact:**  Applications relying on the snapshot buffer could receive incorrect or stale data.
*   **Attack Vector:** Reading the snapshot buffer while a snapshot occurs.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to use the tracing subsystem.
*   **Fix:** The fix ensures the reader always points to the correct snapshot buffer after a swap.

**4. ftrace: Fix modification of direct_function hash while in use**
*   **Root Cause:** Modification of the `direct_functions` hash table was not thread-safe, causing a race condition, and also a memory leak in `register_ftrace_direct()`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Race condition and memory leak
*   **Impact:**  The race could lead to referencing invalid memory and data corruption. The memory leak could cause the system to run out of memory
*   **Attack Vector:**  Adding a large number of ftrace entries
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have root privileges to add ftrace entries.
*  **Fix:**  The fix allocates a new hash at the start, copies the entries to the new hash and uses `rcu_pointer_assign()` to update `direct_functions`, which is now atomic.

**5. ring-buffer: Fix wake ups when `buffer_percent` is set to 100**
*   **Root Cause:**  The logic for checking if the ring buffer was full when `buffer_percent` is set to 100 was incorrect, preventing blocked readers from being woken up.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Blocked readers may not be awakened when buffer_percent is set to 100.
*   **Impact:**  Applications relying on the buffer\_percent trigger will not be woken up.
*   **Attack Vector:** setting `buffer_percent` to 100 and expecting the reader to be woken up.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to use the tracing subsystem.
*   **Fix:** The fix adjusts the condition to check if the ring buffer is full.

**6. mm/memory-failure: check the mapcount of the precise page**
*   **Root Cause:** When a process only maps some pages in a folio and not the head page the process could be missed if the mapped page is poisoned.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Processes could be missed if only the poisoned page is mapped, or unnecessarily hit if the head page is mapped but not the poisoned page.
*   **Impact:**  Memory failures may not be handled for all processes mapping the poisoned page or handled for processes not mapping the poisoned page.
*  **Attack Vector:**  Causing memory failures when processes have partial mappings of folios.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to trigger a memory failure.
*   **Fix:** The fix checks the map count of the precise page, instead of the head page.

**7. mm/memory-failure: cast index to loff_t before shifting it**
*   **Root Cause:** On 32-bit systems, the code loses the top bits of an index due to arithmetic being performed in `unsigned long` instead of `unsigned long long`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Loss of top bits on 32-bit systems for memory failures of files over 4GB
*   **Impact:** Incorrect memory failure handling for files over 4GB in size.
*   **Attack Vector:** Causing memory failures on files over 4GB
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to trigger memory failures.
*   **Fix:** The index is cast to `loff_t` before shifting it, ensuring the correct math operation is performed.

**8. mm: migrate high-order folios in swap cache correctly**
*   **Root Cause:** The migration code did not correctly handle the difference between the swap cache and page cache when migrating large folios.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stale pointers to migrated folios, potentially leading to data corruption or infinite loops.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption or infinite loops.
*   **Attack Vector:** Triggering the migration of large folios in swap cache.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger swap operations.
*   **Fix:** The fix correctly handles migration of large folios in the swap cache, avoiding stale pointers.

**9. mm/filemap: avoid buffered read/write race to read inconsistent data**
*   **Root Cause:** A race condition between buffered read and write operations could cause inconsistent data to be read due to missing memory barriers.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Data inconsistency.
*   **Impact:**  Reading stale data from the file.
*   **Attack Vector:** Triggering concurrent buffered read and write operations on the same file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to perform read and write operations to the same file.
*   **Fix:** Adds a missing read memory barrier to ensure data consistency.

**10. selftests: secretmem: floor the memory size to the multiple of page\_size**
*   **Root Cause:**  The selftest for secretmem allocated memory that was not a multiple of page size.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Test failure.
*   **Impact:**  The selftest fails.
*  **Attack Vector:** The test itself.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** None
*   **Fix:** The fix floors the memory size to the nearest multiple of page size before allocation.

**11. maple_tree: do not preallocate nodes for slot stores**
*   **Root Cause:** The code was unnecessarily preallocating a node for slot stores when no allocation is needed.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Increased memory usage
*   **Impact:**  Increased memory consumption due to unnecessary allocations.
*   **Attack Vector:** Using slot stores in a maple tree.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** None
*   **Fix:** The fix avoids preallocating nodes for slot stores.

**12. platform/x86: p2sb: Allow `p2sb_bar()` calls during PCI device probe**
*   **Root Cause:**  Locking `pci_rescan_remove_lock` in `p2sb_bar()` could cause a deadlock during PCI bus rescans.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Deadlock
*   **Impact:**  System lockup.
*   **Attack Vector:** Triggering PCI rescans when P2SB devices are being probed.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to trigger PCI device rescans.
*   **Fix:**  The fix removes the lock in `p2sb_bar()` and caches the P2SB resources at `fs_initcall` to avoid the deadlock.

**13. ksmbd: avoid duplicate `opinfo_put()` call on error of `smb21_lease_break_ack()`**
*   **Root Cause:**  `opinfo_put()` could be called twice on error in `smb21_lease_break_ack()`, potentially leading to a use-after-free.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Use-after-free.
*   **Impact:**  Kernel crash or potential arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Sending malformed lease break acknowledgement.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the ksmbd server.
*   **Fix:** The fix prevents the duplicate call to `opinfo_put()`.

**14. mptcp: fix inconsistent state on fastopen race**
*   **Root Cause:** A race condition exists where the netlink PM can remove a subflow while the syn-ack packet for that subflow is being processed, which could lead to a subflow handshake being uncompleted, leading to a kernel warning and inconsistent connection state.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Inconsistent state.
*   **Impact:**  Kernel warning and potentially connection issues.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Fastopen self-connect attempts race with netlink PM operations.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to use fastopen and trigger netlink operations.
*   **Fix:** The fix catches the racing subflow state change, triggers MPTCP fallback and caches the target state in a new msk-level field.

**15. mptcp: fix possible NULL pointer dereference on close**
*   **Root Cause:**  The MPTCP release callback could dereference the first subflow pointer after it has been freed at socket destruction time.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** NULL pointer dereference.
*   **Impact:**  Kernel crash.
*   **Attack Vector:** Closing an MPTCP socket while the connect event is being handled by the release callback.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to create and close MPTCP sockets.
*   **Fix:** The fix explicitly checks if `msk->first` is valid before dereferencing it.

**16. virtio_ring: fix syncs DMA memory with different direction**
* **Root Cause:** The `virtqueue_dma_sync_single_range_for_{cpu,device}` APIs ignored the `dir` parameter which lead to incorrect DMA sync and a warning.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Incorrect DMA synchronization
* **Impact:** Potential data corruption or unexpected behavior
* **Attack Vector:** Using virtio devices with DMA
* **Required Attacker Capabilities:** None, it could be triggered by normal virtio operations
* **Fix:** The fix uses the `dir` parameter

**17. fs: cifs: Fix atime update check**
* **Root Cause:**  An incorrect atime comparison against mtime leading to them being exactly equal.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Incorrect atime
* **Impact:**  Incorrect access time reported by the file system.
* **Attack Vector:** Accessing files through CIFS
* **Required Attacker Capabilities:** None
* **Fix:** The comparison between atime and mtime was fixed
