Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2024-22107:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `setTermsHashAction` method of the `CCApi.class.php` file. This occurs because the application directly incorporates user-supplied input (`hash` parameter) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **SQL Injection:** The `setTermsHashAction` method constructs a SQL query using string concatenation, directly embedding the `hash` and `userId` parameters from the request. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code by manipulating the `hash` parameter.
2. **Insecure Credentials:** The system used a default credential ("wizard/password!@@@") which could be easily found by an attacker.
3.  **Cleartext Password:** The password was stored as an unsalted MD5 hash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1.  **Authentication Bypass:** By exploiting the SQL injection, an attacker can modify the password hash of the administrator user in the `users` table. This enables the attacker to log in as the administrator.
2.  **Remote Code Execution:** After gaining administrator access, the attacker can exploit a command injection vulnerability present in the `systemSettingsDnsDataAction` method via the `host_name` parameter, allowing the execution of arbitrary commands on the server. This can lead to a webshell on the server.
3.  **Full System Compromise:** As the product is a DLP solution, a successful exploit allows access to sensitive data, credentials, and the ability to execute code on connected workstations.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **Unauthenticated SQL Injection:** The SQL injection vulnerability is present in a function that is accessible without prior authentication on the `/ccapi.php` endpoint.
2. **Authenticated Command Injection:** Once administrator access is achieved, the attacker sends a POST request to `/old/react/v1/api/system/dns/data` to exploit the command injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target system to send HTTP requests.
2.  **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to form HTTP requests (e.g. GET, POST)
3. **Knowledge of vulnerable application:** The attacker needs to be able to identify the vulnerable parameters in the requests.
4.  **Administrator Access (after SQLi):** After the SQL injection is successful, the attacker needs to authenticate using the newly set administrator credentials.
5. **Code Execution:** The attacker needs knowledge of command execution via the injection, and the ability to upload a webshell.

*   The provided content is from a blog post detailing the discovery and exploitation of these vulnerabilities.
*   The blog post also details how a root shell can be obtained by modifying GRUB parameters, which is a separate issue (not directly related to this CVE, but provides context of initial access to the system).
*   The provided exploit code chains the SQL injection and command injection vulnerabilities to achieve a remote webshell.
*   The vulnerable software is "GTB Central Console".
*   The blog post highlights the speed with which the vendor fixed the vulnerabilities.
