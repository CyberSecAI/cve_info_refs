{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `deleteUpdateAPK` function in `SystemHandler.class.php` constructs a command to delete an APK file using the `file_name` parameter from user input without proper sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Command Injection",
      "Insufficient Input Sanitization",
      "Use of exec with user-controlled input"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary command execution on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint with malicious commands injected in the `file_name` parameter.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the Vinchin server's API, and potentially have knowledge of the `deleteUpdateAPK` endpoint and required parameters. User authentication may be required."
