Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in FlyCms v1.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The application lacks proper CSRF protection on the `/system/user/group_save` endpoint. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, can modify user group settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow an attacker to modify user group settings such as group name, discount, minimum experience, and maximum experience, potentially leading to privilege escalation, unauthorized access, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a malicious web page that contains a crafted HTML form. The attacker tricks a logged-in user into visiting this page. When the user's browser loads the page, the form is automatically submitted in the background.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page that a logged-in user can access. The attacker does not need direct access to the vulnerable application server. The victim must be logged into the FlyCms application for the attack to succeed.

**Additional details:**
- The provided PoC demonstrates how an attacker can create an HTML page to exploit the CSRF vulnerability.
- The PoC includes a hidden form that submits a POST request to `/system/user/group_save` with crafted values for `groupName`, `discount`, `minexp`, and `maxexp`.
- The PoC shows the attack succeeds in changing the user group settings.
- The target FlyCms version is specified as v1.0.
