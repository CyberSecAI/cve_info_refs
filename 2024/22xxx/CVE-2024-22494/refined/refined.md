```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `moblie` field in the `/guestbook/save` endpoint of JFinalcms is not properly encoded or filtered.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can inject arbitrary web script or HTML, which is then executed in the context of a user's browser (specifically when an administrator logs in and accesses `/admin/guestbook`). This allows an attacker to potentially steal cookies or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the victim.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a malicious payload to the `/guestbook/save` endpoint through the `mobile` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be remote and only needs to send a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint."
