Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the Django template engine in the `gofiber/template` library having auto-escaping disabled by default. This means that user-supplied data rendered through the template engine could contain malicious scripts that would be executed by the user's browser, leading to XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is the risk of injecting malicious scripts into web pages via user-provided data that is not properly escaped.
- Default Insecure Configuration: The library's default setting of disabling auto-escaping introduces an inherent vulnerability.
- Improper Neutralization of Input: The template engine did not automatically sanitize user-supplied data by escaping special characters that can be interpreted as HTML or JavaScript.
- CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
- CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
- CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Execution of Malicious Scripts: Attackers can inject malicious scripts into web pages, leading to a variety of potential attacks, such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- Data Breach or Manipulation: By injecting scripts, an attacker could potentially access sensitive data or modify data visible to the user.
- Defacement: An attacker could alter the appearance of the website, potentially damaging the reputation of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- User-supplied Data: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious scripts into data that will be rendered through the vulnerable template engine, often through form inputs, URL parameters, or other external sources.
- Network Attack: The vulnerability is exploitable over a network with low attack complexity since no user interaction is needed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No Privileges Needed: The attacker does not need any specific privileges on the system or application.
- External Position: The attacker can be remote, simply needing a way to inject malicious content into the data that is rendered by the template engine.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in versions prior to 3.1.9 of `github.com/gofiber/template/django`
- The fix involved enabling auto-escaping by default, which helps prevent the injection of malicious scripts
- The vulnerability can be worked around by explicitly enabling auto-escaping in templates using Django tags `{% autoescape on %}`.
- The vulnerability is assigned a CVSS score of 9.3, indicating a critical severity.
