Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-22119

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by improper input validation in Zabbix's frontend when handling item names in the graph items select form. Specifically, the application does not sanitize or encode the input, which allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML code within item names.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. Malicious JavaScript code is injected via a crafted item name and then stored in the database. This code is executed when a user views the graph containing the item and clicks on the item name.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser within the context of the Zabbix application.
- **Session hijacking:** An attacker can steal user session cookies by leveraging the javascript execution and potentially gain control over the user's account.
- **Data theft:** The attacker could potentially steal sensitive information from the Zabbix interface.
- **Defacement:** The attacker can alter the appearance or behavior of the application as seen by the user.
- **Malware distribution:** The attacker could redirect the user to a malicious website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Item Name Field:** The attacker crafts a malicious item name that includes the XSS payload.
- **Graph creation:** This malicious item is then added to a graph.
- **User Interaction:** The XSS payload is activated when a user opens the graph and clicks on the malicious item name within the select form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Zabbix access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to create or edit items and graphs within the Zabbix system. The attacker must have a valid user session.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided example demonstrates the XSS payload being injected as `<img src="x" onerror="alert('UWAGA');"/>`. When the item name containing this payload is clicked in the graph items select form, the onerror event triggers, executing the JavaScript `alert('UWAGA');` code which shows an alert box.
- The issue affects Zabbix versions 5.0, 6.0, 6.4 and master branch.
- The vulnerability is fixed in versions 5.0.42rc1 and 7.0 (plan).
- The vulnerability is classified as a "Blocker" priority security defect, indicating its severity.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Debian LTS advisory confirms that the vulnerability has been addressed in version 1:4.0.4+dfsg-1+deb10u5 of the zabbix package for Debian 10 (buster).
- This information is consistent with the CVE description, but provides more specific details of the attack vector and impact.
