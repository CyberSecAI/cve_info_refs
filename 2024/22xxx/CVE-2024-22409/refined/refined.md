The provided content is related to CVE-2024-22409.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from overly broad default privileges assigned to low-privileged users in the Datahub application. This allowed them to perform actions that should have been restricted to higher-level users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate access control: Low-privileged users had permissions to remove users, edit group memberships, and modify other user's profiles.
- Overly permissive default policies: The default policies granted excessive privileges to low-privileged users, leading to the possibility of privilege escalation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation: Low-privileged users could escalate their privileges up to admin level if an admin group exists.
- Unauthorized user manipulation: Attackers can remove users, modify group members to add themselves, and alter other user's information (email, etc.)
- Potential for broader system compromise: Successful privilege escalation could lead to a wider range of malicious activities within the datahub environment.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The attack can be performed remotely through the network, leveraging the exposed GraphQL API.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Low-privileged user access: The attacker needs to have a valid account with low-level privileges within the vulnerable Datahub instance.
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to access the network where Datahub is running.
