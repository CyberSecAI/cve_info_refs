Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The D-Link Go-RT-AC750 router has a hardcoded username ("Alphanetworks") and password ("$image_sign") for telnet access. This is configured within the router's firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Hardcoded credentials: The primary vulnerability is the presence of hardcoded credentials that are not unique to each device and are easily discoverable within the firmware.
- Telnet service enabled: The telnet service is enabled by default, which should be avoided.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Full root access: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to gain full root access to the affected device via a telnet session.
- Complete device compromise: With root access, attackers can potentially modify the router's configuration, intercept network traffic, install malware, or use the device as part of a botnet.

**Attack vectors:**
- Telnet: The primary attack vector is through the telnet service on the router.
- Network access: The attacker needs network access to the router, either directly from the local network or potentially remotely if the telnet service is exposed to the internet (which is a common misconfiguration).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be on the same network as the router or have network access to the router's telnet port.
- Knowledge of hardcoded credentials: The attacker needs to know or discover the hardcoded credentials ("Alphanetworks" and "$image_sign").
