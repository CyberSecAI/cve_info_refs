Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-22096:

**Vulnerability:** Relative Path Traversal (CWE-23)

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied file paths. An attacker can insert path traversal characters (e.g., "../") into the filename when using a specific command.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Insufficient input validation, specifically related to file path handling.
    *   Failure to restrict access to authorized directories.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can read arbitrary files from the system.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating filenames in specific commands.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to use the affected command. The attack vector is network based.

**Summary:** This vulnerability allows an authenticated user to read arbitrary files from the server by exploiting a lack of proper path validation when handling filenames in specific commands.
