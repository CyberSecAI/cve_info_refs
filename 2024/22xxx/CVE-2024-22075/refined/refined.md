Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-22075:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a combination of a Client-Side Path Traversal (CSPT) vulnerability and the use of `v-html` in Vue.js (or similar in other frameworks) to render a server-provided error message without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Client-Side Path Traversal (CSPT):** The application extracts a parameter (`id`) from the URL and uses it to construct an API request. The `id` is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject path traversal sequences (`../`) and redirect the API request to other endpoints.
2.  **Sanitization Bypass (`v-html`):** The application uses the `v-html` directive to render an error message received from the server as raw HTML. This bypasses the built-in sanitization mechanisms of the framework.
3.  **Unsanitized Error Messages:** The application was vulnerable because the error message returned by the API, specifically from the `/reports/default/` endpoint, included user-controlled data. This data was not sanitized before being rendered as HTML, which leads to XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could inject arbitrary HTML and CSS code into the victim's browser. This could be used for:
    *   **Phishing:** Redirecting users to a fake login page to steal their credentials.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Leveraging CSS to exfiltrate sensitive information.
    *   **UI Manipulation:** Creating a fake user interface to trick the user into performing unintended actions.
    * While the default CSP in Firefly III prevents XSS the vulnerability could still lead to malicious HTML or CSS injection.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing a path traversal sequence and an XSS payload.
*   The attacker tricks a victim into clicking the malicious link, for example through a phishing email.
*   When the victim's browser loads the page, it extracts the malicious `id` from the URL, triggering a request to the attacker-controlled endpoint with the attacker's payload.
*  The response containing the malicious payload is then rendered using the `v-html` directive.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious payload.
*   The attacker needs to trick a victim into visiting this URL while authenticated to the application.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Firefly III before version v6.1.1.
*   The fix involved sanitizing the `webhookId` by parsing it as an integer to prevent path traversal. The error message from the /reports/default/ endpoint was also changed to a static message without any dynamic content to avoid any unsanitized reflection of user provided input.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by SonarSource.
