The content directly relates to CVE-2024-22207. The official description from NetApp states, "Multiple NetApp products incorporate Node.js. swagger-ui of Node.js versions prior to 2.1.0 are susceptible to a vulnerability which when successfully exploited could lead to disclosure of sensitive information." This aligns with the description found in the GitHub advisory which describes a vulnerability where the default configuration of `@fastify/swagger-ui` exposes all files in the module's directory if `baseDir` is not set.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of potentially sensitive files residing within the `@fastify/swagger-ui` module's directory when `baseDir` is not configured.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Disclosure of Sensitive Information:** Successful exploitation could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. This aligns with NetApp and the GitHub Advisory.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network as the files are exposed via HTTP routes.
