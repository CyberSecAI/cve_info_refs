- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `sscanf` function in `http.c` at line 54, used to parse HTTP requests, does not limit the number of characters read into the `method`, `uri`, and `version` buffers. This allows an attacker to send a specially crafted request with an overly long URI, causing a stack buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to unbounded reads using `sscanf` into fixed-size stack buffers.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution can be achieved by overflowing the stack, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can send a crafted HTTP request with an overly long URI to the vulnerable server. The server's `handle_request` function will attempt to parse the URI using `sscanf` without checking the size, leading to the overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the server. No special privileges or local access is required.
