- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Kubernetes secrets in the IBM Storage Defender Connection Manager on-premises environment are obfuscated using base64 encoding instead of being encrypted.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of base64 encoding for secrets instead of encryption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker who has gained root access to the environment can read the secrets from the Kubernetes configuration.
- **Attack vectors**: Gaining root access to the environment.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Root access to the environment.
