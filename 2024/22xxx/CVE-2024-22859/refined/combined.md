**Comments**

This does not appear to be an actual vulnerability.

The referenced commit is fixing a CSRF expiring issue, which was causing 419 errors and I cannot see how it could possibly be used for a CSRF attack.

All of the changes are within the front end javascript, which is outside scope of CSRF, and relate to loading a fresh CSRF token from the HTML, rather than reusing the same token, which may have expired since it was retrieved.

Is there any way to get the entire CVE removed?

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Mmmmm well if this really isn't a vulnerability then ya we can remove it at least from the github database. If you want to get the CVE completely rejected you'll need to get in contact with the assigning CNA (mitre) <https://cve.mitre.org/cve/list_rules_and_guidance/correcting_counting_issues.html> <https://cveform.mitre.org/>  So, I'm not overly familiar with this project. Can you help lay out for me why this issue isn't valid? |

| Thanks for the links to get the CVE rejected! üôÇ  Here's the details to explain why it's invalid:  The CVE references a single commit as it's only proof and provides no details or PoC: [livewire/livewire@5d88731](https://github.com/livewire/livewire/commit/5d887316f2aaf83c0e380ac5e72766f19700fa3b)  The commit it references is simply a bugfix that prevents a CSRF token from being remembered by the browser, to prevent the token from expiring as the page content changes. It instead loads the CSRF live from the HTML each time it's needed.  In addition, the reference to "allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code getCsrfToken function" makes no sense because the removal of the `getCsrfToken` method is purely within a JS import statement. In fact, all of the changes are made within the frontend javascript, which is completely outside the scope of a CSRF attack. That would be an XSS attack, but these changes don't indicate any potential for that sort of attack either.  It looks like an automated scanner has flagged the removal of `getCsrfToken` and someone who doesn't understand the project has made an assumption. |

| [@darakian](https://github.com/darakian) thanks for the info. I'm one of the core maintainers for Livewire and [@valorin](https://github.com/valorin) is correct.  Livewire is a framework built on top of Laravel.  In Laravel it uses CSRF tokens per session rather than per request. As such we were caching the CSRF token on the front end for any subsequent requests.  But we ran into issues with this if a session token got regenerated on the backend, Livewire would use the cached CSRF token which would trigger a 419 `session has expired` response. As such in that commit we changed the code to not cache the CSRF token and instead get it fresh from the server on every request.  As such we don't believe it is a vulnerability, so if we could get that removed from the database, that would be great üòÅ  Thanks for the Mitre links, we weren't sure how to find out where it originated from. We will look into seeing if we can get it removed through Mitre too. |

| Ya, looking at the commit it does seem very strange to me that the CVE claims to get code execution. Anyway, I'll go ahead and get this moving on our end too. üëç |
