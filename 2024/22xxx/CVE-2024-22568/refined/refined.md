Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the lack of CSRF protection in the `/system/score/del` endpoint of FlyCms v1.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the `/system/score/del` endpoint.
- The application does not validate the origin of the request, allowing attackers to trigger actions on behalf of legitimate users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can trick a logged-in user into making unintended requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- In this case, the attacker can delete scores with the `id` parameter.
- Potential for data manipulation or deletion.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that submits a request to the `/system/score/del` endpoint.
- The malicious page can be hosted on an attacker-controlled server or delivered through other means like email.
- When a logged-in user visits the attacker's page, their browser automatically sends the forged request to the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must know the structure of the vulnerable request (target URL, required parameters).
- The attacker must be able to trick a logged-in user into accessing the malicious HTML page.
- The attacker doesn't need direct access to the user's account or credentials but needs the user to have an active, authenticated session with the target application.
