**Root Cause:** The WordPress Image Tag Manager plugin (versions <= 1.5) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding, which allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts (such as redirects, advertisements, or other HTML payloads) into the website. When a user visits a page containing the injected script, the script will be executed in their browser. This can lead to various attacks including:

*   Redirecting users to malicious websites
*   Displaying unwanted advertisements
*   Stealing cookies and session data
*   Defacing the website
*   Performing other client-side attacks within the user's browser context.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated, meaning that this vulnerability can be exploited by anyone.
*   The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious script through a vulnerable part of the plugin. The specific mechanism is not detailed.

**Additional details:**
