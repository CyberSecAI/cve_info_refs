{
  "CVE-2024-22050": {
    "Description": "A path traversal vulnerability was detected in iodine's static file service. Malicious URL drafting may cause the static file server to attempt a response containing data from files that shouldn't be normally accessible from the public folder.",
    "Root cause": "Improper sanitization of user-supplied paths when serving static files.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Path Traversal"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can potentially read files outside of the intended web root directory.",
    "Attack vectors": "By crafting malicious URLs with path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`)",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the vulnerable server. No special capabilities or authentication are needed.",
    "Patches": [
      "The vulnerability was patched in version 0.7.34."
     ],
   "Workarounds": [
      "A possible workaround would be to disable the static file service and it's `X-Sendfile` support, sending static files using nginx or a source code solution (sending the data dynamically)."
    ]
