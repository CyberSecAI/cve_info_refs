|  |  | #### Change log v.0.7.34 |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \*\*Security\*\*: (`facil.io`, `http`) updated to facil.io 0.7.3, incorporating it's bug fixes and security updates. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | #### Change log v.0.7.33 |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \*\*Fix\*\*: (`iodine`) exception protection would fail and crash if the exception throws wasn't of type `Exception`. I'm not sure how this would happen, but on some Ruby versions it appeared to have occur, maybe where a custom `raise` would be called with a non-exception type. The issue was fixed by testing for the availability of the `message` and `backtrace` functions. Credit to Jan Biedermann (@janbiedermann) for exposing this issue (#76). |

ghsa: 85rf-xh54-whp3
url: https://github.com/boazsegev/iodine/security/advisories/GHSA-85rf-xh54-whp3
title: Malicious URL drafting attack against iodines static file server may allow
path traversal
date: 2019-10-07
description: |
### Impact
A path traversal vulnerability was detected in iodine's static
file service. This vulnerability effects any application running
iodine's static file server on an effected iodine version.
Malicious URL drafting may cause the static file server to attempt
a response containing data from files that shouldn't be normally
accessible from the public folder.
### Patches
The vulnerability was patched in version 0.7.34. Please upgrade
to the latest version.
### Workarounds
A possible workaround would be to disable the static file service
and it's `X-Sendfile` support, sending static files using nginx
or a source code solution (sending the data dynamically).
However, it would be better to upgrade iodine to the latest
version, as it also contains non-security related fixes.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

#### Plans & Pricing

#### What are the differences between the Free, Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.

Iodine is a fast concurrent web application server for real-time Ruby applications, with native support for WebSockets and Pub/Sub services - but it's also so much more.

Iodine is a Ruby wrapper for much of the [facil.io](https://facil.io) C framework, leveraging the speed of C for many common web application tasks. In addition, iodine abstracts away all network concerns, so you never need to worry about the transport layer, leaving you free to concentrate on your application logic.

Iodine includes native support for:

* HTTP, WebSockets and EventSource (SSE) Services (server);
* WebSocket connections (server / client);
* Pub/Sub (with optional Redis Pub/Sub scaling);
* Fast(!) builtin Mustache templating;
* Static file service (with automatic `gzip` support for pre-compressed assets);
* Optimized Logging to `stderr`;
* Asynchronous event scheduling and timers;
* HTTP/1.1 keep-alive and pipelining;
* Heap Fragmentation Protection;
* TLS 1.2 and above (Requiring OpenSSL >= 1.1.0);
* TCP/IP server and client connectivity;
* Unix Socket server and client connectivity;
* Hot Restarts (using the USR1 signal and without hot deployment);
* Custom protocol authoring;
* [Sequel](https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel) and ActiveRecord forking protection;
* and more!

Since iodine wraps much of the [C facil.io framework](https://github.com/boazsegev/facil.io) for Ruby:

* Iodine can handle **thousands of concurrent connections** (tested with more then 20K connections on Linux)!
* Iodine is ideal for **Linux/Unix** based systems (i.e. macOS, Ubuntu, FreeBSD etc'), which are ideal for evented IO (while Windows and Solaris are better at IO *completion* events, which are very different).

Iodine is a C extension for Ruby, developed and optimized for Ruby MRI 2.3 and up... it should support the whole Ruby 2.x and 3.x MRI family, but CI tests start at Ruby 2.3.

**Note**: iodine does **not** support streaming when using Rack. It's recommended to avoid blocking the server when using `body.each` since the `each` loop will block iodine's thread until it's finished and iodine won't send any data before the loop is done.

## Iodine - a fast & powerful HTTP + WebSockets server with native Pub/Sub

Iodine includes a light and fast HTTP and Websocket server written in C that was written according to the [Rack interface specifications](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/rack/rack/master/file/SPEC) and the [Websocket draft extension](/boazsegev/iodine/blob/master/SPEC-Websocket-Draft.md).

With `Iodine.listen service: :http` it's possible to run multiple HTTP applications (but please remember not to set more than a single application on a single TCP/IP port).

Iodine also supports native process cluster Pub/Sub and a native RedisEngine to easily scale iodine's Pub/Sub horizontally.

### Known Issues and Reporting Issues

See the [GitHub Open Issues](https://github.com/boazsegev/iodine/issues) list for known issues and to report new issues.

### Installing and Running Iodine

Install iodine on any Linux / BSD / macOS system using:

```
gem install iodine
```

Using the iodine server is easy, simply add iodine as a gem to your Rails / Sinatra / Rack application's `Gemfile`:

```
gem 'iodine', '~>0.7'
```

Then start your application from the command-line / terminal using iodine:

```
bundler exec iodine
```

#### Installing with SSL/TLS

**Note**: iodine has known issues with the TLS/SSL support. TLS/SSL should **NOT** be used in production (see issues #95 and #94).

Make sure to update OpenSSL to the latest version **before installing Ruby** (`rbenv` should do this automatically).

To avoid name resolution conflicts, iodine will bind to the same OpenSSL version Ruby is bound to. To use SSL/TLS this should be OpenSSL >= 1.1.0 or LibreSSL >= 2.7.4.

Verbose installation should provide a confirmation message, such as:

```
$ gem install iodine -f -V
...
checking for -lcrypto... yes
checking for -lssl... yes
Detected OpenSSL library, testing for version.
Confirmed OpenSSL to be version 1.1.0 or above (OpenSSL 1.1.0j  20 Nov 2018)...
* Compiling with HAVE_OPENSSL.
...
```

The installation script tests for OpenSSL 1.1.0 and above. However, this testing approach sometimes provides false positives. **If TLS isn't required, install with `NO_SSL=1`**. i.e.:

```
NO_SSL=1 bundler exec iodine
```

### Running with Rails

On Rails:

1. Replace the `puma` gem with the `iodine` gem.
2. Remove the `config/puma.rb` file (or comment out the code).
3. Optionally, it's possible to add a `config/initializers/iodine.rb` file. For example:

   ```
   # Iodine setup - use conditional setup to allow command-line arguments to override these:
   if(defined?(Iodine))
     Iodine.threads = ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS", 5).to_i if Iodine.threads.zero?
     Iodine.workers = ENV.fetch("WEB_CONCURRENCY", 2).to_i if Iodine.workers.zero?
     Iodine::DEFAULT_SETTINGS[:port] ||= ENV.fetch("PORT") if ENV.fetch("PORT")
   end
   ```

When using native WebSockets with Rails, middle-ware is probably the best approach. A guide for this approach will, hopefully, get published in the future.

**Note**: command-line instructions (CLI) should be the preferred way for configuring iodine, allowing for code-less configuration updates.

### Optimizing Iodine's Concurrency

To get the most out of iodine, consider the amount of CPU cores available and the concurrency level the application requires.

Iodine will calculate, when possible, a good enough default concurrency model for fast applications. See if this works for your application or customize according to the application's needs.

Command line arguments allow easy access to different options, including concurrency levels. i.e., to set up 16 threads and 4 processes:

```
bundler exec iodine -p $PORT -t 16 -w 4
```

The environment variables `THREADS` and `WORKERS` are automatically recognized when iodine is first required, allowing environment specific customization. i.e.:

```
export THREADS=16
export WORKERS=-1 # negative values are fractions of CPU cores.
bundler exec iodine -p $PORT
```

Negative values are evaluated as "CPU Cores / abs(Value)". i.e., on an 8 core CPU machine, this will produce 4 worker processes with 2 threads per worker:

```
bundler exec iodine -p $PORT -t 2 -w -2
```

### Heap Fragmentation Protection

Iodine includes a fast, network oriented, custom memory allocator, optimizing away some of the work usually placed on the Ruby Garbage Collector (GC).

This approach helps to minimize heap fragmentation for long running processes, by grouping many short-lived objects into a common memory space.

It is still recommended to consider [jemalloc](http://jemalloc.net) or other allocators that also help mitigate heap fragmentation issues.

### Static file serving support

Iodine supports an internal static file service that bypasses the Ruby layer and serves static files directly from "C-land".

This means that iodine won't lock Ruby's GVL when sending static files. The files will be sent directly, allowing for true native concurrency.

Since the Ruby layer is unaware of these requests, logging can be performed by turning iodine's logger on.

To use native static file service, setup the public folder's address **before** starting the server.

This can be done when starting the server from the command line:

```
bundler exec iodine -p $PORT -t 16 -w 4 -www /my/public/folder
```

Or using a simple Ruby script. i.e. (a `my_server.rb` example):

```
require 'iodine'
# static file service
Iodine.listen, service: :http, public: '/my/public/folder'
# for static file service, we only need a single thread and a single worker.
Iodine.threads = 1
Iodine.start
```

To enable logging from the command line, use the `-v` (verbose) option:

```
bundler exec iodine -p $PORT -t 16 -w 4 -www /my/public/folder -v
```

#### X-Sendfile

When a public folder is assigned (the static file server is active), iodine automatically adds support for the `X-Sendfile` header in any Ruby application response.

This allows Ruby to send very large files using a very small memory footprint and usually leverages the `sendfile` system call.

i.e. (example `config.ru` for iodine):

```
app = proc do |env|
  request = Rack::Request.new(env)
  if request.path_info == '/source'.freeze
    [200, { 'X-Sendfile' => File.expand_path(__FILE__), 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'}, []]
  elsif request.path_info == '/file'.freeze
    [200, { 'X-Header' => 'This was a Rack::Sendfile response sent as text.' }, File.open(__FILE__)]
  else
    [200, { 'Content-Type' => 'text/html',
            'Content-Length' => request.path_info.length.to_s },
     [request.path_info]]
 end
end
# # optional:
# use Rack::Sendfile
run app
```

Benchmark [localhost:3000/source](http://localhost:3000/source) to experience the `X-Sendfile` extension at work.

#### Pre-Compressed assets / files

Rails does this automatically when compiling assets, which is: `gzip` your static files.

Iodine will automatically recognize and send the `gz` version if the client (browser) supports the `gzip` transfer-encoding.

For example, to offer a compressed version of `style.css`, run (in the terminal):

```
$  gzip -k -9 style.css
```

This results in both files, `style.css` (the original) and `style.css.gz` (the compressed).

When a browser that supports compressed encoding (which is most browsers) requests the file, iodine will recognize that a pre-compressed option exists and will prefer the `gzip` compressed version.

It's as easy as that. No extra code required.

### Special HTTP `Upgrade` and SSE support

Iodine's HTTP server implements the [WebSocket/SSE Rack Specification Draft](/boazsegev/iodine/blob/master/SPEC-Websocket-Draft.md), supporting native WebSocket/SSE connections using Rack's `env` Hash.

This promotes separation of concerns, where iodine handles all the Network related logic and the application can focus on the API and data it provides.

Upgrading an HTTP connection can be performed either using iodine's native WebSocket / EventSource (SSE) support with `env['rack.upgrade?']` or by implementing your own protocol directly over the TCP/IP layer - be it a WebSocket flavor or something completely different - using `env['upgrade.tcp']`.

#### EventSource / SSE

Iodine treats EventSource / SSE connections as if they were a half-duplex WebSocket connection, using the exact same API and callbacks as WebSockets.

When an EventSource / SSE request is received, iodine will set the Rack Hash's upgrade property to `:sse`, so that: `env['rack.upgrade?'] == :sse`.

The rest is detailed in the WebSocket support section.

#### WebSockets

When a WebSocket connection request is received, iodine will set the Rack Hash's upgrade property to `:websocket`, so that: `env['rack.upgrade?'] == :websocket`

To "upgrade" the HTTP request to the WebSockets protocol (or SSE), simply provide iodine with a WebSocket Callback Object instance or class: `env['rack.upgrade'] = MyWebsocketClass` or `env['rack.upgrade'] = MyWebsocketClass.new(args)`

Iodine will adopt the object, providing it with network functionality (methods such as `write`, `defer` and `close` will become available) and invoke it's callbacks on network events.

Here is a simple chat-room example we can run in the terminal (`irb`) or easily paste into a `config.ru` file:

```
require 'iodine'
module WebsocketChat
  def on_open client
    # Pub/Sub directly to the client (or use a block to process the messages)
    client.subscribe :chat
    # Writing directly to the socket
    client.write "You're now in the chatroom."
  end

### Native Pub/Sub with *optional* Redis scaling

Iodine's core, `facil.io` offers a native Pub/Sub implementation that can be scaled across machine boundaries using Redis.

The default implementation covers the whole process cluster, so a single cluster doesn't need Redis

Once a single iodine process cluster isn't enough, horizontal scaling for the Pub/Sub layer is as simple as connecting iodine to Redis using the `-r <url>` from the command line. i.e.:

```
$ iodine -w -1 -t 8 -r redis://localhost
```

It's also possible to initialize the iodine<=>Redis link using Ruby, directly from the application's code:

```
# initialize the Redis engine for each iodine process.
if ENV["REDIS_URL"]
  Iodine::PubSub.default = Iodine::PubSub::Redis.new(ENV["REDIS_URL"])
else
  puts "* No Redis, it's okay, pub/sub will still run on the whole process cluster."
end
# ... the rest of the application remains unchanged.
```

Iodine's Redis client can also be used for asynchronous Redis command execution. i.e.:

```
if(Iodine::PubSub.default.is_a? Iodine::PubSub::Redis)
  # Ask Redis about all it's client connections and print out the reply.
  Iodine::PubSub.default.cmd("CLIENT LIST") { |reply| puts reply }
end
```

**Pub/Sub Details and Limitations:**

* Iodine's Redis client does *not* support multiple databases. This is both because [database scoping is ignored by Redis during pub/sub](https://redis.io/topics/pubsub#database-amp-scoping) and because [Redis Cluster doesn't support multiple databases](https://redis.io/topics/cluster-spec). This indicated that multiple database support just isn't worth the extra effort and performance hit.
* The iodine Redis client will use two Redis connections for the whole process cluster (a single publishing connection and a single subscription connection), minimizing the Redis load and network bandwidth.
* Connections will be automatically re-established if timeouts or errors occur.

### Hot Restart

Iodine will "hot-restart" the application by shutting down and re-spawning the worker processes.

This will clear away any memory fragmentation concerns and other issues that might plague a long running worker process or ruby application.

To hot-restart iodine, send the `SIGUSR1` signal to the root process.

The following code will hot-restart iodine every 4 hours when iodine is running in cluster mode:

```
Iodine.run_every(4 * 60 * 60 * 1000) do
  Process.kill("SIGUSR1", Process.pid) unless Iodine.worker?
end
```

Since the master / root process doesn't handle any requests (it only handles pub/sub and house-keeping), it's memory map and process data shouldn't be as affected and the new worker processes should be healthier and more performant.

**Note**: This will **not** re-load the application (any changes to the Ruby code require an actual restart).

### Optimized HTTP logging

By default, iodine is pretty quiet. Some messages are logged to `stderr`, but not many.

However, HTTP requests can be logged using iodine's optimized logger to `stderr`. Iodine will optimize the log output by caching the output time string which updates every second rather than every request.

This can be performed by setting the `-v` flag during startup, i.e.:

```
bundler exec iodine -p $PORT -t 16 -w 4 -v -www /my/public/folder
```

The log output can be redirected to a file:

```
bundler exec iodine -p $PORT -v  2>my_log.log
```

The log output can also be redirected to a `stdout`:

```
bundler exec iodine -p $PORT -v  2>&1
```

### Built-in support for Sequel and ActiveRecord

It's a well known fact that [Database connections require special attention when using `fork`-ing servers (multi-process servers)](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/concurrency-and-database-connections#multi-process-servers) such as Puma, Passenger (Pro) and iodine.

However, it's also true that [these issues go unnoticed by many developers](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45570999/4025095), since application developers are (rightfully) focused on the application rather than the infrastructure.

With iodine, there's no need to worry.

Iodine provides built-in `fork` handling for both ActiveRecord and [Sequel](https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel), in order to protect against these possible errors.

### Client Support

Iodine supports raw (TCP/IP and Unix Sockets) client connections as well as WebSocket connections.

This can be utilized for communicating across micro services or taking advantage of persistent connection APIs such as ActionCable APIs, socket.io APIs etc'.

Here is an example WebSocket client that will connect to the [WebSocket.org echo test service](https://www.websocket.org/echo.html) and send a number of pre-programmed messages.

```
require 'iodine'

# The client class
class EchoClient

  def on_open(connection)
    @messages = [ "Hello World!",
      "I'm alive and sending messages",
      "I also receive messages",
      "now that we all know this...",
      "I can stop.",
      "Goodbye." ]
    send_one_message(connection)
  end

  def on_message(connection, message)
    puts "Received: #{message}"
    send_one_message(connection)
  end

  def on_close(connection)
    # in this example, we stop iodine once the client is closed
    puts "* Client closed."
    Iodine.stop
  end

  # We use this method to pop messages from the queue and send them
  #
  # When the queue is empty, we disconnect the client.
  def send_one_message(connection)
    msg = @messages.shift
    if(msg)
      connection.write msg
    else
      connection.close
    end
  end
end

Iodine.threads = 1
Iodine.connect url: "wss://echo.websocket.org", handler: EchoClient.new, ping: 40
Iodine.start
```

### TLS >= 1.2 support

> Requires OpenSSL >= `1.1.0`. On Heroku, requires `heroku-18`.

Iodine supports secure connections fore TLS version 1.2 **and up** (depending on the OpenSSL version).

A self signed certificate is available using the `-tls` flag from the command-line.

PEM encoded certificates (which is probably the most common format) can be loaded from the command-line (`-tls-cert` and `-tls-key`) or dynamically (using `Iodine::TLS`).

The TLS API is simplified but powerful, supporting the ALPN extension and peer verification (which client connections really should leverage).

When enabling peer verification for server connections (using `Iodine::TLS#trust`), clients will be required to submit a trusted certificate in order to connect to the server.

### TCP/IP (raw) sockets

Upgrading to a custom protocol (i.e., in order to implement your own WebSocket protocol with special extensions) is available when neither WebSockets nor SSE connection upgrades were requested. In the following (terminal) example, we'll use an echo server without direct socket echo:

```
require 'iodine'
class MyProtocol
  def on_message client, data
    # regular socket echo - NOT websockets
    client.write data
  end
end
APP = Proc.new do |env|
  if env["HTTP_UPGRADE".freeze] =~ /echo/i.freeze
    env['upgrade.tcp'.freeze] = MyProtocol.new
    # an HTTP response will be sent before changing protocols.
    [101, { "Upgrade" => "echo" }, []]
  else
    [200, {"Content-Length" => "12", "Content-Type" => "text/plain"}, ["Welcome Home"] ]
  end
end
# # in irb:
Iodine.listen service: :http, public: "www/public", handler: APP
Iodine.threads = 1
Iodine.start
# # or in config.ru
run APP
```

### How does it compare to other servers?

In my tests, pitching Iodine against Puma, Iodine was anywhere between x1.5 and more than x10 faster than Puma (depending on use-case and settings).

Such a big difference is suspect and I recommend that you test it yourself - even better if you test performance using your own application and a number of possible different settings (how many threads per CPU core? how many worker processes? middleware vs. server request logging, etc').

I recommend benchmarking the performance for yourself using `wrk` or `ab`:

```
$ wrk -c200 -d4 -t2 http://localhost:3000/
# or
$ ab -n 100000 -c 200 -k http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```

The best application to use for benchmarking is your actual application. Or, you could create a simple `config.ru` file with a **hello world** app:

```
App = Proc.new do |env|
   [200,
     {   "Content-Type" => "text/html".freeze,
         "Content-Length" => "16".freeze },
     ['Hello from Rack!'.freeze]  ]
end

run App
```

Then start comparing servers. Here are the settings I used to compare iodine and Puma (4 processes, 4 threads):

```
$ RACK_ENV=production iodine -p 3000 -t 4 -w 4
# vs.
$ RACK_ENV=production puma -p 3000 -t 4 -w 4
# Review the `iodine -?` help for more command line options.
```

It's recommended that the servers (Iodine/Puma) and the client (`wrk`/`ab`) run on separate machines.

It is worth noting that iodine can also speed up logging by replacing the logging middleware with `iodine -v`. This approach uses less memory and improves performance at the expense of fuzzy timing and some string caching.

On my machine, testing with the logging functionality enabled, iodine was more then 10 times faster than puma (60.9K req/sec vs. 5.3K req/sec)

### A few notes

Iodine's upgrade / callback design has a number of benefits, some of them related to better IO handling, resource optimization (no need for two IO polling systems), etc. This also allows us to use middleware without interfering with connection upgrades and provides backwards compatibility.

Iodine's HTTP server imposes a few restrictions for performance and security reasons, such as limiting each header line to 8Kb. These restrictions shouldn't be an issue and are similar to limitations imposed by Apache or Nginx.

If you still want to use Rack's `hijack` API, iodine will support you - but be aware that you will need to implement your own reactor and thread pool for any sockets you hijack, as well as a socket buffer for non-blocking `write` operations (why do that when you can write a protocol object and have the main reactor manage the socket?).

## Installation

To install iodine, simply install the the `iodine` gem:

```
$ gem install iodine
```

Iodine is written in C and allows some compile-time customizations, such as:

* `FIO_FORCE_MALLOC` - avoids iodine's custom memory allocator and use `malloc` instead (mostly used when debugging iodine or when using a different memory allocator).
* `FIO_MAX_SOCK_CAPACITY` - limits iodine's maximum client capacity. Defaults to 131,072 clients.
* `FIO_USE_RISKY_HASH` - replaces SipHash with RiskyHash for iodine's internal hash maps.

  Since iodine hash maps have internal protection against collisions and hash flooding attacks, it's possible for iodine to leverage RiskyHash, which is faster than SipHash.

  By default, SipHash will be used. This is a community related choice, since the community seems to believe a hash function should protect the hash map rather than it being enough for a hash map implementation to be attack resistance.
* `HTTP_MAX_HEADER_COUNT` - limits the number of headers the HTTP server will accept before disconnecting a client (security). Defaults to 128 headers (permissive).
* `HTTP_MAX_HEADER_LENGTH` - limits the number of bytes allowed for a single header (pre-allocated memory per connection + security). Defaults to 8Kb per header line (normal).
* `HTTP_BUSY_UNLESS_HAS_FDS` - requires at least X number of free file descriptors (for new database connections, etc') before accepting a new HTTP client.
* `FIO_ENGINE_POLL` - prefer the `poll` system call over `epoll` or `kqueue` (not recommended).
* `FIO_LOG_LENGTH_LIMIT` - sets the limit on iodine's logging messages (uses stack memory, so limits must be reasonable. Defaults to 2048.
* `FIO_TLS_PRINT_SECRET` - if true, the OpenSSL master key will be printed as debug message level log. Use only for testing (with WireShark etc'), never in production! Default: false.

These options can be used, for example, like so:

```
  gem install iodine -- \
      --with-cflags=\"-DHTTP_MAX_HEADER_LENGTH=48000 -DFIO_FORCE_MALLOC=1 -DHTTP_MAX_HEADER_COUNT=64\"
```

More possible compile time options can be found in the [facil.io documentation](http://facil.io).

## Evented oriented design with extra safety

Iodine is an evented server, similar in its architecture to `nginx` and `puma`. It's different than the simple "thread-per-client" design that is often taught when we begin to learn about network programming.

By leveraging `epoll` (on Linux) and `kqueue` (on BSD), iodine can listen to multiple network events on multiple sockets using a single thread.

All these events go into a task queue, together with the application events and any user generated tasks, such as ones scheduled by [`Iodine.run`](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/boazsegev/iodine/Iodine#run-class_method).

In pseudo-code, this might look like this

```
QUEUE = Queue.new

def server_cycle
    if(QUEUE.empty?)
      QUEUE << get_next_32_socket_events # these events schedule the proper user code to run
    end
    QUEUE << server_cycle
end

def run_server
      while ((event = QUEUE.pop))
            event.shift.call(*event)
      end
end
```

In pure Ruby (without using C extensions or Java), it's possible to do the same by using `select`... and although `select` has some issues, it could work well for lighter loads.

The server events are fairly fast and fragmented (longer code is fragmented across multiple events), so one thread is enough to run the server including it's static file service and everything...

...but single threaded mode should probably be avoided.

It's very common that the application's code will run slower and require external resources (i.e., databases, a custom pub/sub service, etc'). This slow code could "starve" the server, which is patiently waiting to run it's short tasks on the same thread.

The thread pool is there to help slow user code.

The slower your application code, the more threads you will need to keep the server running in a responsive manner (note that responsiveness and speed aren't always the same).

To make a thread pool easier and safer to use, iodine makes sure that no connection task / callback is called concurrently for the same connection.

For example, a is a WebSocket connection is already busy in it's `on_message` callback, no other messages will be forwarded to the callback until the current callback returns.

## Free, as in freedom (BYO beer)

Iodine is **free** and **open source**, so why not take it out for a spin?

It's installable just like any other gem on Ruby MRI, run:

```
$ gem install iodine

```

If building the native C extension fails, please note that some Ruby installations, such as on Ubuntu, require that you separately install the development headers (`ruby.h` and friends). I have no idea why they do that, as you will need the development headers for any native gems you want to install - so hurry up and get them.

If you have the development headers but still can't compile the iodine extension, [open an issue](https://github.com/boazsegev/iodine/issues) with any messages you're getting and I'll be happy to look into it.

## Mr. Sandman, write me a server

Iodine allows custom TCP/IP server authoring, for those cases where we need raw TCP/IP (UDP isn't supported just yet).

Here's a short and sweet echo server - No HTTP, just use `telnet`:

```
USE_TLS = false

require 'iodine'

# an echo protocol with asynchronous notifications.
class EchoProtocol
  # `on_message` is called when data is available.
  def on_message client, buffer
    # writing will never block and will use a buffer written in C when needed.
    client.write buffer
    # close will be performed only once all the data in the write buffer
    # was sent. use `force_close` to close early.
    client.close if buffer =~ /^bye[\r\n]/i
    # run asynchronous tasks... after a set number of milliseconds
    Iodine.run_after(1000) do
      # or schedule the task immediately
      Iodine.run do
        puts "Echoed data: #{buffer}"
      end
    end
  end
end

tls = USE_TLS ? Iodine::TLS.new("localhost") : nil

# listen on port 3000 for the echo protocol.
Iodine.listen(port: "3000", tls: tls) { EchoProtocol.new }
Iodine.threads = 1
Iodine.workers = 1
Iodine.start
```

Or a nice plain text chat room (connect using `telnet` or `nc` ):

```
require 'iodine'

# a chat protocol with asynchronous notifications.
class ChatProtocol
  def initialize nickname = "guest"
    @nickname = nickname
  end
  def on_open client
    client.subscribe :chat
    client.publish :chat, "#{@nickname} joined chat.\n"
    client.timeout = 40
  end
  def on_close client
    client.publish :chat, "#{@nickname} left chat.\n"
  end
  def on_shutdown client
    client.write "Server is shutting down... try reconnecting later.\n"
  end
  def on_message client, buffer
    if(buffer[-1] == "\n")
      client.publish :chat, "#{@nickname}: #{buffer}"
    else
      client.publish :chat, "#{@nickname}: #{buffer}\n"
    end
    # close will be performed only once all the data in the outgoing buffer
    client.close if buffer =~ /^bye[\r\n]/i
  end
  def ping client
    client.write "(ping) Are you there, #{@nickname}...?\n"
  end
end

# an initial login protocol
class LoginProtocol
  def on_open client
    client.write "Enter nickname to log in to chat room:\n"
    client.timeout = 10
  end
  def ping client
    client.write "Time's up... goodbye.\n"
    client.close
  end
  def on_message client, buffer
    # validate nickname and switch connection callback to ChatProtocol
    nickname = buffer.split("\n")[0]
    while (nickname && nickname.length() > 0 && (nickname[-1] == '\n' || nickname[-1] == '\r'))
      nickname = nickname.slice(0, nickname.length() -1)
    end
    if(nickname && nickname.length() > 0 && buffer.split("\n").length() == 1)
      chat = ChatProtocol.new(nickname)
      client.handler = chat
    else
      client.write "Nickname error, try again.\n"
      on_open client
    end
  end
end

# listen on port 3000
Iodine.listen(port: 3000) { LoginProtocol.new }
Iodine.threads = 1
Iodine.workers = 1
Iodine.start
```

### Why not EventMachine?

EventMachine attempts to give the developer access to the network layer while Iodine attempts to abstract the network layer away and offer the developer a distraction free platform.

You can go ahead and use EventMachine if you like. They're doing amazing work on that one and it's been used a lot in Ruby-land... really, tons of good developers and people on that project.

But why not take iodine out for a spin and see for yourself?

## Can I contribute?

Yes, please, here are some thoughts:

* I'm really not good at writing automated tests and benchmarks, any help would be appreciated. I keep testing manually and that's less then ideal (and it's mistake prone).
* PRs or issues related to [the `facil.io` C framework](https://github.com/boazsegev/facil.io) should be placed in [the `facil.io` repository](https://github.com/boazsegev/facil.io).
* Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at <https://github.com/boazsegev/iodine>.
* If we can write a Java wrapper for [the `facil.io` C framework](https://github.com/boazsegev/facil.io), it would be nice... but it could be as big a project as the whole gem, as a lot of minor details are implemented within the bridge between these two languages.
* If you love the project or thought the code was nice, maybe helped you in your own project, drop me a line. I'd love to know.

## Malicious URL drafting attack against iodines static file server may allow path traversal

Low severity

[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-85rf-xh54-whp3)
[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-85rf-xh54-whp3/dependabot)

## Package

bundler

iodine
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

< 0.7.34

## Patched versions

0.7.34

## Description

### Impact

A path traversal vulnerability was detected in iodine's static file service. This vulnerability effects any application running iodine's static file server on an effected iodine version.

Malicious URL drafting may cause the static file server to attempt a response containing data from files that shouldn't be normally accessible from the public folder.

### Patches

The vulnerability was patched in version 0.7.34. Please upgrade to the latest version.

### Workarounds

A possible workaround would be to disable the static file service and it's `X-Sendfile` support, sending static files using nginx or a source code solution (sending the data dynamically).

However, it would be better to upgrade iodine to the latest version, as it also contains non-security related fixes.

![](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/particles-de1dd20f3008.png)A Copilot chat window with extensions enabled. The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.

# Malicious URL drafting attack against iodines static file server may allow path traversal

## Package

iodine

## Affected versions

<=0.7.33

## Patched versions

0.7.34

## Description

### Impact

A path traversal vulnerability was detected in iodine's static file service. This vulnerability effects any application running iodine's static file server on an effected iodine version.

Malicious URL drafting may cause the static file server to attempt a response containing data from files that shouldn't be normally accessible from the public folder.

### Patches

The vulnerability was patched in version 0.7.34. Please upgrade to the latest version.

### Workarounds

A possible workaround would be to disable the static file service and it's `X-Sendfile` support, sending static files using nginx or a source code solution (sending the data dynamically).

However, it would be better to upgrade iodine to the latest version, as it also contains non-security related fixes.
