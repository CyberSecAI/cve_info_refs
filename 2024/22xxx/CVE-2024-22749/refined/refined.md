The provided content relates to CVE-2024-22749.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `gf_isom_new_generic_sample_description` function within the `isomedia/isom_write.c` file of the GPAC software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `strcpy` to copy the `compressor_name` from `udesc` to `entry->compressor_name` without checking the buffer size, allowing for a buffer overflow when `udesc->compressor_name` is larger than the destination buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to a buffer overflow, which can result in denial of service (application crash) due to memory corruption. It may also lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered when processing a crafted MP4 file that contains a specially crafted `compressor_name` field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted MP4 file, which when parsed by the `MP4Box` tool, will trigger the vulnerability in the `gf_isom_new_generic_sample_description` function when creating a dash manifest. The attacker doesn't need any special privileges, only access to an MP4 file processing tool or application that uses the vulnerable code.
