## Description

### Impact

*What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?*

An information leakage vulnerability is present in [`cdo-local-uuid`](https://pypi.org/project/cdo-local-uuid/) at version `0.4.0`, and in [`case-utils`](https://pypi.org/project/case-utils/) in unpatched versions (matching the pattern `0.x.0`) at and since `0.5.0`, before `0.15.0`.

The vulnerability stems from a Python function, `cdo_local_uuid.local_uuid()`, and its original implementation `case_utils.local_uuid()`. Henceforth, both will be called `local_uuid()`.

`local_uuid()` generates [UUIDv5](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122#section-4.3)s using a deterministic pseudorandom number stream. This was written to make graph application demonstrations generate consistent, version-controllable output with minimal noise caused by demonstration re-runs. Part of the information used to keep individual examples' generated output distinct from one another is seed information from the caller's environment, particularly the program's argument vector. The present working directory is also included as part of the seed information, but for reasons including maintaining user environment privacy, as well as keeping generated identifiers consistent regardless of where a source tree is housed on a user's file system, the present working directory is trimmed from the left to exclude path information outside of a supplied "Top" source directory. (In context of the Make scripting language, this "top" directory is typically in a variable called `top_srcdir`. In context of Git-based project management, this directory is expected to be the root directory of a freshly "Cloned" project, e.g., where `.git` is stored.)

Under certain conditions, a user's present working directory, as an absolute path, was incorporated into seed data for the `local_uuid()` deterministic pseudorandom number stream. This violates an expectation made in the documented purpose of the `local_uuid()` function, and leaks information about a calling user's environment.

The conditions are:

* Given a project with top source directory `top_srcdir`, for instance `/home/user1/Documents/Project1`;
* Given a Python script housed directly in `top_srcdir`, for instance at `${top_srcdir}/example.py`, written to support the deterministic mode of `local_uuid()`;
* Given a call to that Python script that follows the documentation for `local_uuid()`;

The absolute path for `top_srcdir` was then included in the seed information for the UUIDv5 stream, when what was intended was a relative path spelling. That is, instead of `./example.py` being in the seed data, `/home/user1/Documents/Project1/example.py` was in the seed data.

This does not leak the present working directory directly. But, given other knowledge of how a program had been called to generate data using `local_uuid()` under these conditions, it becomes possible to determine that a chosen path can lead to a known UUIDv5 value. Note that it is not necessarily knowable that the chosen path is the *only* solution to a sequence reconstruction; but, the path can be confirmed to be *a* solution.

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

The issue has been patched, in the `cdo-local-uuid` source repository and the `case-utils` source repository.

Users should upgrade to any of these versions minimally:

* `case-utils == 0.5.1`
* `case-utils == 0.6.1`
* `case-utils == 0.7.1`
* `case-utils == 0.8.1`
* `case-utils == 0.9.1`
* `case-utils == 0.10.1`
* `case-utils == 0.11.1`
* `case-utils == 0.12.1`
* `case-utils == 0.13.1`
* `case-utils == 0.14.1`
* `case-utils >= 0.15.0`
* `cdo-local-uuid == 0.5.0`

All `case-utils` releases that contain the patch have the commit `ea630cce66b26dae6d7fa7e02451d6e25456a5f2` in their Git history. Anyone interested in confirming the presence of this commit in a certain branch or tag can run the following test (written in Bash), substituting the desired branch name for the assigned value of `my_git_ref_of_interest`:

```
#!/bin/bash
# Present working directory ($PWD) should be in a clone of this repository:
# https://github.com/casework/CASE-Utilities-Python
my_git_ref_of_interest=main
test \
  "xea630cce66b26dae6d7fa7e02451d6e25456a5f2" \
  == \
  "x$(git merge-base ea630cc ${my_git_ref_of_interest})"
echo $?  # Should print '0'
```

Note that other releases have been posted atop some of those minimal versions recommended for upgrading, named, e.g., `0.5.1.post0`. These releases were posted to update internal library version numbers, and otherwise contain no functional changes, in accordance with Python Packaging guidance:

* <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/version-specifiers/#post-release-separators>

### Workarounds

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?*

If the script calling `cdo_local_uuid.local_uuid()` is moved out of the "Top" source directory, the issue is addressed.

### References

*Are there any links users can visit to find out more?*

The issue is addressed in this Pull Request:

* [#3](https://github.com/Cyber-Domain-Ontology/CDO-Utility-Local-UUID/pull/3)

Tests to reproduce the issue's conditions and confirm it has been addressed are in this Pull Requested:

* [#4](https://github.com/Cyber-Domain-Ontology/CDO-Utility-Local-UUID/pull/4)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

This `exclude` is to prevent the demonstration applications under `tests/relativity_to_venv` from being picked up as part of the package being sent to `pypi`.

I'll disclaim that I haven't used this directive before. We can try using test PyPI if we aren't sure this exclude will work on the first try.

Sorry, something went wrong.
