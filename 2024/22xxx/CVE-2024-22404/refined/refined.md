Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-22404:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Files ZIP app for Nextcloud, where the application fails to properly enforce "view-only" permissions when creating a zip archive of a folder. Specifically, the application does not check for download permissions on shared files when including them in a ZIP archive.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Access Control:** The core issue is the insufficient access control mechanism in the Files ZIP app. It bypasses the "view-only" restrictions on shared files by allowing them to be included in a zip archive.
*   **Missing Permission Check:** The application does not check for the "download" permission when processing shared files for inclusion in a zip archive.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** A user with "view-only" access to shared files can bypass this restriction by zipping the folder and downloading the files within the archive. This results in unauthorized access to the content of the files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is network-based, meaning the attacker can perform the exploit remotely over a network connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** An attacker needs only a low-privileged account with "view-only" access to the targeted shared files or folders.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The attacker needs to manually initiate the zip operation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability was implemented in versions 1.2.1, 1.4.1, and 1.5.0 of the Files ZIP app.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as having "Moderate" severity with a CVSS score of 4.1.
*   The vulnerability is identified by CWE-284 which refers to Improper Access Control.
*   The fix was introduced via pull request #192.

In summary, CVE-2024-22404 is a vulnerability in the Nextcloud Files ZIP app where users with view-only permissions can download files by zipping shared folders, violating the intended access restrictions.
