# Unencrypted task can be created in encrypted collaboration

Low

[bartvanb](/bartvanb)
published
GHSA-rjmv-52mp-gjrr
Jan 30, 2024

## Package

pip

vantage6
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<4.1.3

## Patched versions

4.2.0+

## Description

### Impact

There are no checks on whether the input is encrypted if a task is created in an encrypted collaboration. Therefore, a user may accidentally create a task with sensitive input data that will then be stored unencrypted in a database.

### Patches

No

### Workarounds

This is not an issue with the normal workflow, only if e.g. a user with the python client sets encryption to the wrong value.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-22193

### Weaknesses

[CWE-922](/advisories?query=cwe%3A922)
