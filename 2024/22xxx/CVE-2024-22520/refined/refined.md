The provided content is related to CVE-2024-22520.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Drone Scanner App does not authenticate the authenticity of received data packets, which are generated by Dronetag devices and broadcasted according to the Droneid protocol. This lack of authentication allows attackers to inject crafted, malicious data packets into the system.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of authentication for received data packets.
- Vulnerability to spoofed Remote ID signals.
- Vulnerability to flood attacks with ghost drone signals.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Users may be unable to distinguish between genuine and fake drone signals due to a large number of ghost signals being broadcasted, thus hindering the application's main functionality.
- Attackers can impersonate legitimate drone Remote ID signals, allowing them to conceal their identities while engaging in potentially illicit activities.
- Safety incidents can occur due to compromised regulation and security of unmanned aerial vehicles.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attackers can broadcast crafted data packets using a transmitter (e.g., ESP32 microcontroller) that mimics the Droneid protocol. These can be sent via WiFi or Bluetooth.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to program a microcontroller with WiFi or Bluetooth capabilities to send customized data packets.
- Knowledge of the Droneid protocol to craft valid-looking data packets.
- Proximity to the target system to broadcast spoofed signals.
