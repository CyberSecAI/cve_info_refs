- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the GFI Archiver Core Service, leading to the deserialization of untrusted data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Deserialization of untrusted data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on the affected GFI Archiver installation.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks targeting the Core Service, which listens on TCP port 8017 by default.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Authentication to the GFI Archiver service is required to exploit this vulnerability.
