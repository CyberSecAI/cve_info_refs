Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-11775:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization and output escaping within the Particle Background plugin's `particleground` shortcode. Specifically, user-supplied attributes are not being sanitized before being used in the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS. This means that malicious scripts can be injected and stored in the database, and will be executed when a user accesses a page containing the vulnerable shortcode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts, which can lead to a variety of malicious activities when a user visits an affected page. This may include:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the plugin's `particleground` shortcode. By injecting malicious code into attributes used within this shortcode, the attacker can introduce the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated Contributor or higher access:**  An attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This level of access allows the attacker to create or edit posts and pages which is required to insert the malicious shortcode.

**Additional Notes:**

- The plugin has been temporarily closed on the WordPress plugin directory pending a full review.
- There is no known patch available for this vulnerability. The suggested remediation is to remove the plugin.
- The vulnerability was discovered by a researcher named zaim, as reported by Wordfence.
- The vulnerable code snippet is located in line 59 of `particleground.php`, where the shortcode attributes are directly used in the output without sanitization.

```php
return '<div id="particles" style="background-color:'.$name["bgcolor"].'"><div id="pg-inner">'.$content.'</div></div>';
```

This vulnerability is classified as a medium severity vulnerability with a CVSS score of 6.4.
