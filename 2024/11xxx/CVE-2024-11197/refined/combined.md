### Description

The Lock User Account plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to user lock bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.5. This is due to permitting application password logins when user accounts are locked. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with existing application passwords, to interact with the vulnerable site via an API such as XML-RPC or REST despite their account being locked.

Like the plugin very much. There are still improvements areas:
– Would like to see the locked column in Users (admin) sortable.
– In that same column I would like to see a button “Lock/Unlock” per user right next to the check mark.
That would really make this a 5-star plugin!

This is really a smart, fast and very light plugin to lock user accounts with the custom error message we can change any time.

Lock user account plugin is surprisingly simple to use and it do what it claims to do. Half of my problems are solved by this plugin. I will be really happy to see its BuddyPress version.
