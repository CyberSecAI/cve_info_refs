- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the use of a vulnerable version of Telerik Web UI within the GFI Archiver product installer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The use of an outdated and vulnerable Telerik Web UI component.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the NETWORK SERVICE account. This can lead to a full system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote and requires no prior authentication, meaning an attacker can exploit this over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable GFI Archiver installation. No specific privileges or prior authentication is required.
