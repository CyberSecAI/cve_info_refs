{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the parsing of DXF files due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, leading to a write past the end of an allocated buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds write.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves opening a malicious DXF file or visiting a malicious web page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the victim interact with a malicious file or web page (user interaction is required)."
