Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11926

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of authorization checks within several AJAX actions of the Travel Booking WordPress Theme. Specifically, the functions `__stPartnerCreateServiceRental`, `st_delete_order_item`, `_st_partner_approve_booking`, `save_order_item`, and `__userDenyEachInfo` are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Missing Authorization:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper capability checks on the mentioned AJAX functions. This means that these functions can be accessed and executed by users who should not have the necessary permissions.
* **Insecure AJAX Actions:** The vulnerable functions are accessible via AJAX requests, which makes them exploitable without requiring direct access to the WordPress backend.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker exploiting this vulnerability can:
* **Modify Posts:** Alter content of posts and pages.
* **Delete Posts/Pages:** Remove content from the website.
* **Approve Arbitrary Orders:** Manipulate the booking system.
* **Insert Orders with Arbitrary Prices:** Inject fraudulent bookings with custom prices.
* **Deny User Information:** Restrict or modify user access to certain information.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Network:** The attack is carried out remotely via network requests.
* **AJAX Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered through crafted AJAX requests to the vulnerable functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be a logged-in user with at least a subscriber-level access or higher. This is a low privilege level in WordPress.
* **Knowledge of Vulnerable AJAX Actions:** The attacker needs to know the names of the vulnerable AJAX functions and the required parameters.
