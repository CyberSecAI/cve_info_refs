Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-11053:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability arises when curl is instructed to use a `.netrc` file for credentials and simultaneously follow HTTP redirects. If the `.netrc` file has an entry matching the redirect target's hostname, but that entry omits the password (or both login and password), curl can incorrectly reuse the password from the initial host when redirected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Credential Leakage:** Sensitive password information from the initial host is unintentionally exposed to the redirected host.
- **Incorrect Netrc Handling:** The vulnerability is a result of flawed logic in how curl handles credentials from the `.netrc` file during redirects. It improperly reuses the password when it should not.
- CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious or compromised server can potentially gain access to a user's credentials intended for a different server by exploiting this flaw, and redirecting the request.
- This can lead to unauthorized access to systems, data breaches, and other security compromises.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Redirects:** The attacker needs to control the redirect target, causing the vulnerable curl client to connect to it.
- **`.netrc` File:** The user must have a `.netrc` file configured with credentials for the initial host, and a deficient entry for the redirect target, that either omits just the password or omits both login and password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to control the server initiating the redirect.
- The attacker does not need any access to the user's .netrc file.
- The user must be using a vulnerable version of curl.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is classified as "Low" severity.
- The vulnerability affects both the curl command-line tool and libcurl library.
- The bug is not considered a "C mistake".
- The fix addresses a few other related .netrc issues.
- The fix was introduced in version 8.11.1
