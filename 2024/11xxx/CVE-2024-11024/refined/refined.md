Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-11024:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `AppPresser – Mobile App Framework` plugin's improper validation of password reset codes. Specifically, the plugin does not verify the reset code associated with a user before allowing a password update, making it possible to bypass the intended reset workflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insufficient validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation of password reset codes in the `validate_reset_password` function. This function updates the user password based on a code and new password without verifying if the code is legitimate or belongs to the user.
*   **Unauthenticated access:** The vulnerability allows unauthenticated users to exploit the flawed password reset mechanism if they know a valid email address of an existing user.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Privilege escalation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to reset a user's password, gaining unauthorized access to their account, potentially leading to complete account takeover.
*   **Full access:** The attacker gains full control of the compromised user account, allowing them to change user data, modify content, and take any other action the compromised user is authorized for.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network-based attack:** The attack can be carried out remotely by sending crafted HTTP requests to the WordPress site hosting the vulnerable plugin.
*   **Password reset endpoint:** The specific attack vector involves targeting the plugin's password reset functionality, likely through an API endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to have an existing account on the targeted WordPress site.
*   **Knowledge of a user email address:** The attacker needs to know a valid user email address registered on the WordPress site using the vulnerable plugin.

**Additional notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of the `AppPresser – Mobile App Framework` plugin up to and including version 4.4.6.
*   Version 4.4.7 of the plugin includes a fix for this vulnerability.
* The fix involves sanitizing and validating the code, password, and email parameters before using them in the password reset process. It also modified the function calls for password reset.
* Wordfence reported 89 attacks in the last 24 hours targeting this vulnerability.
