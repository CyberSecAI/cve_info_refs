- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies within the parsing of DXF files due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data. This leads to a read past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An out-of-bounds read vulnerability is present.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a remote attacker. The user must either visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious file to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious DXF file. User interaction (opening the malicious file or visiting a malicious webpage) is required.
