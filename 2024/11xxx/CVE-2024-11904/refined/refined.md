Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the 'msntt\_add\_plus\_talk' shortcode of the 코드엠샵 소셜톡 WordPress plugin. User-supplied attributes are not properly sanitized, leading to the possibility of injecting arbitrary web scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS because it allows users (with Contributor or higher roles) to inject malicious scripts into the database through shortcode attributes. This script is then executed when other users view the affected page.
*  **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation:** The plugin fails to neutralize the input provided through shortcode attributes before including it in the generated web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the affected website.
*   **Account Takeover:**  Malicious JavaScript could be used to redirect users to phishing pages, steal user cookies (leading to account compromise), or perform other actions on behalf of the victim.
*   **Website Defacement:** The attacker could modify the displayed content on the website.
*   **Malware Distribution:** An attacker could inject malicious code that downloads malware onto the visitor's computer.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Injection:** The attack vector is the 'msntt\_add\_plus\_talk' shortcode. An attacker can insert malicious scripts into the shortcode's attributes (e.g., `size`, `color`, `shape`, `type`).
*   **WordPress Pages/Posts:**  The injected shortcode would be placed within the content of a WordPress page or post.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This allows them to create/edit pages or posts containing the vulnerable shortcode.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.2.0.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Peter Thaleikis.
*   The fix involves sanitizing the shortcode attributes using `esc_attr()`.
*   The patched version of the plugin is 1.2.1

**Summary:**
The provided content describes a stored XSS vulnerability in the  코드엠샵 소셜톡 WordPress plugin. This vulnerability is caused by insufficient input sanitization of shortcode attributes which allows authenticated users with contributor or higher permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts that are executed whenever a user accesses an injected page.
