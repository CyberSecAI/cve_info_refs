| CVSS | 6.4 (Medium) |
| Publicly Published | December 6, 2024 |

### Description

The 코드엠샵 소셜톡 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'msntt\_add\_plus\_talk' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
