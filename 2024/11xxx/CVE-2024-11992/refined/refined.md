Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input in the `aDirFiles%5B0%5D` parameter on the `admin.php` page within Quick.CMS version 6.7. This allows for absolute path traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The application fails to properly restrict file path inputs, allowing an attacker to specify paths outside of the intended document root.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application does not validate or sanitize the `aDirFiles%5B0%5D` parameter, allowing the inclusion of absolute file paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Download:** Remote attackers can bypass intended restrictions and download arbitrary files from the server, as long as the file has appropriate permissions.
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** Attackers can delete files stored on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
- **Parameter Manipulation:** The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating the `aDirFiles%5B0%5D` parameter in the `admin.php` page with a crafted absolute path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
- **No Authentication Required:** It appears that no authentication is required to trigger this vulnerability, as indicated by the CVSS vector.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Quick.CMS version 6.7.
- The vulnerability is considered critical with a CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.1.
