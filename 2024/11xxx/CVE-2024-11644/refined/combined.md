## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP-SVG <= 0.9 - Contributor+ Stored XSS via Shortcode

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in a page/post where the shortcode is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

Add the payload:
```
[svg src="https://example.com/wp-admin/images/wordpress-logo.svg" width="500" height='500" onmouseover="alert(/XSS/)"']
```
Move the mouseover the WordPress logo to see the JS alert
