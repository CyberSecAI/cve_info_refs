{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'success' and 'error' parameters.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthenticated attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute if a user is tricked into performing an action, such as clicking a malicious link.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL with the 'success' or 'error' parameters containing a payload. This malicious URL has to be visited by a victim.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking on the link. No authentication is required."
