The WP Timetics- AI-powered Appointment Booking Calendar and Online Scheduling Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a missing capability check on the /wp-json/timetics/v1/customers/ REST API endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.27. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Timetics Customer access and above, to delete arbitrary users.
