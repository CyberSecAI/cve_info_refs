### Root cause of vulnerability
The vulnerability stems from a missing capability check on the `/wp-json/timetics/v1/customers/` REST API endpoint. Specifically, the `delete_item` function in `/core/customers/api-customer.php` used to allow users with the `timetics-customer` capability to delete arbitrary user data, due to an incorrect permission check. This was changed in version 1.0.28 to require the 'manage_options' capability. The `bulk_delete` function, which allowed deletion of multiple customer records, also had insufficient authorization checks.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- **Missing Authorization Check:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks for the delete functionality on the customers REST API endpoint.
- **Inadequate Capability:** The `timetics-customer` capability was insufficient for performing user deletion.

### Impact of exploitation
- **Unauthorized Data Loss:** Authenticated attackers with the `timetics-customer` role (or higher) could delete arbitrary users on the site. This results in data loss, as user information is deleted.

### Attack vectors
- **REST API Endpoint:** The attack vector is the `/wp-json/timetics/v1/customers/` REST API endpoint, specifically through the delete methods.
- **HTTP Requests:** Attackers would send HTTP requests to this endpoint to trigger the deletion of user records.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site.
- **Sufficient Role/Capability:** The attacker needs to have the `timetics-customer` role (or higher access).
