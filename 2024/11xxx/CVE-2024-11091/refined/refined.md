Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11091

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of SVG files uploaded through the REST API. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts within SVG files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to store malicious scripts within SVG files uploaded via the REST API.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not properly sanitize SVG files before they are stored.
- **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The plugin does not properly escape the output when the SVG is accessed, leading to the execution of the injected script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** When a user accesses a page containing a malicious SVG file, the injected script executes in their browser within the context of the WordPress site.
- **Data Theft:** Attackers can potentially steal cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive information.
- **Account Takeover:** If an administrator views the malicious SVG, an attacker could potentially gain administrative access.
- **Malicious Redirects:** The injected script could redirect users to malicious websites.
- **Defacement:** The injected script could alter the appearance or functionality of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **REST API Upload:** The vulnerability is exploited by uploading a malicious SVG file through the WordPress REST API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with Author-level access or higher.
- **REST API Access:** The attacker must have the ability to interact with the WordPress REST API.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects versions <= 1.1.0 of the "Support SVG - Upload svg files in wordpress without hassle" WordPress plugin.
- The vulnerability has been patched in version 1.1.1 by enhancing SVG sanitization during REST API uploads.
- The plugin developer attempted to sanitize SVG files in version 1.1.0 but did not fully address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is considered medium severity.
