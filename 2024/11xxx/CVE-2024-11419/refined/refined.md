{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The plugin uses a cookie (`accessPassword`) to store the password, which is not a secure way to handle authentication, and there's no proper sanitization before comparing the user-provided password with the stored password.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure authentication mechanism: relying on a cookie for authentication.",
      "Lack of sanitization/validation of user-provided password before comparison."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could bypass the password protection by setting the `accessPassword` cookie to the correct password value.  This could allow unauthorized access to the website content that is intended to be password protected.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker would need to set the `accessPassword` cookie value to match the password set in the plugin's settings.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to know the password configured in the plugin's settings. If the password is known they can bypass the login by setting the cookie."
