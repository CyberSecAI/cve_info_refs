Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11188

**Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `custom_html` field option. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts that will be executed when the form is rendered.

**Weaknesses:**
- Lack of proper input sanitization of the `custom_html` field option.
- Insufficient output escaping when rendering the field, allowing the injected script to execute.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code into web pages that execute when a user views the affected form.
- This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking: stealing user cookies and impersonating them.
    - Data theft: capturing sensitive user information.
    - Website defacement: modifying the appearance or content of the website.
    - Malicious redirects: redirecting users to phishing sites or malware download locations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited via a POST request containing malicious code within the `custom_html` parameter when a form is created or updated.
- An attacker needs to trick a user into clicking on a specially crafted link that triggers the execution of injected script on the vulnerable site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- Requires the ability to craft a malicious URL containing the payload and trick a user to visit this URL.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerable code is located in `FrmFieldsHelper.php` file (line 158 is referenced).
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Formidable Forms plugin up to and including 6.16.1.2.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 6.16.2.
