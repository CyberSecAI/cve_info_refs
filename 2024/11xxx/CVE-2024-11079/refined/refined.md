{
  "CVE-2024-11079": {
    "vulnerability": "Unsafe tagging can be bypassed by using the `hostvars` object to indirectly reference the content and successfully template it.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass unsafe content protections using the hostvars object to reference and execute templated content.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of templating with the `hostvars` object",
      "Lack of proper input sanitization/validation when templating content"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution if remote data or module outputs are improperly templated within playbooks. The vulnerability has a low impact on confidentiality, as data exposure depends on the play's logic. It poses a moderate risk to integrity and availability due to potential tampering with execution flows and the termination of critical processes through injected commands.",
    "attack_vector": "The attacker needs access to mangle the content returned to a play (via lookup or module) that uses `hostvars` to reference the unsafe content.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Access to modify remote data or perform MITM attacks. Specific knowledge of the playbook is also required.",
    "additional_notes": "Exploitation is of high complexity. The issue can be mitigated by following security best practices."
  },
  "CVE-2024-11483": {
    "vulnerability": "Improper Scope Handling in OAuth2 Tokens for AAP 2.5",
    "root_cause": "The flaw allows attackers to escalate privileges by improperly leveraging read-scoped OAuth2 tokens to gain write access.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of OAuth2 scope restrictions",
      "API endpoints relying on `ansible_base.oauth2_provider` for OAuth2 authentication"
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can escalate privileges by improperly leveraging read-scoped OAuth2 tokens to gain write access. While the impact is limited to actions within the user’s assigned permissions, it undermines scoped access controls, potentially allowing unintended modifications in the application and consuming services.",
     "attack_vector": "An attacker with a read-scoped OAuth2 token can attempt to bypass restrictions to gain write permissions.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs a valid read-scoped OAuth2 token. The impact is constrained by the user’s base permissions.",
    "additional_notes": "The issue is moderate in severity because it only affects resource integrity within the same security context. Exploitation could be mitigated by following security best practices, such as limiting token privileges and minimizing the use of superuser tokens."
