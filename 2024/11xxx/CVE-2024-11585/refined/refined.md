**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from missing authorization and insufficient file path validation in the `file-process.php` file. This allows unauthenticated users to trigger file operations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing Authorization: There is no check to verify if the user is authorized to perform the requested file operations.
- Insufficient Path Validation: Although there's a regex to filter the filepath, it's insufficient to prevent path traversal.
- Arbitrary File Contents Deletion: The combination of the above weaknesses allows arbitrary file content deletion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary File Content Deletion: Attackers can delete the contents of arbitrary files on the server.
- Site disruption/data loss: This can lead to site breakage, data loss and denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Unauthenticated users can send requests to the vulnerable `file-process.php` file using GET parameters. The parameters include `action`, `file_path`, and `replacement_path`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
