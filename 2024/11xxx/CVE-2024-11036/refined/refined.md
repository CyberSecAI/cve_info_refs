**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation/sanitization
- Arbitrary shortcode execution
- Code Injection

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary shortcodes on the WordPress site. This can lead to various impacts, such as:
- Site defacement or manipulation.
- Potential injection of malicious scripts or code that could lead to further compromise.
- Access to sensitive data or unauthorized actions depending on the shortcodes available and their capabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability is exploited by sending an AJAX request to the `gamipress_get_user_earnings` action with a crafted payload containing the malicious shortcode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- They must be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site's AJAX handler (`wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`).

**Additional Notes:**
The vulnerability is present in all versions of the GamiPress plugin up to and including 7.1.5. The fix is to update to version 7.1.6 or later, which includes the necessary sanitization and input validation.
