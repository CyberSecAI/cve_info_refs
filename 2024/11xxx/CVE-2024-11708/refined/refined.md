{
  "CVE-2024-11708": {
    "Description": "Missing thread synchronization primitives could have led to a data race on members of the PlaybackParams structure.",
    "Root cause": "Missing thread synchronization primitives.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Data race due to lack of thread synchronization."
    ],
    "Impact": "Potential data corruption or unpredictable behavior due to unsynchronized access to shared memory.",
    "Attack vectors": "Exploitation would involve triggering concurrent access to the PlaybackParams structure from multiple threads without proper synchronization.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker would need the ability to manipulate or influence thread execution related to playback operations to cause a data race."
  }
