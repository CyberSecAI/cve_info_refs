- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) files, leading to a memory corruption condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption due to insufficient input validation during CGM file parsing.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can achieve remote code execution, enabling them to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation requires user interaction. A victim must open a malicious CGM file or visit a malicious web page hosting such a file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to provide a crafted CGM file to the user, either through direct file access or by hosting it on a malicious website. The user is required to open the file or visit the malicious page.
