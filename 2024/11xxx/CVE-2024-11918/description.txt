The Image Alt Text plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data| due to a missing capability check on the iat_add_alt_txt_action and iat_update_alt_txt_action AJAX actions in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to update the alt text on arbitrary images.
