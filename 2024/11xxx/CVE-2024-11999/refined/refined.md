Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of unmaintained third-party components within the Schneider Electric Harmony HMI and Pro-face HMI products. This obsolescence creates an attack surface that can be exploited.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CWE-1104: Use of Unmaintained Third-Party Components:** This is the core vulnerability. The presence of outdated components lacking security updates introduces known weaknesses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete Loss of Control:** An attacker can gain full control of the affected HMI device.
- **Loss of Integrity:** The attacker can modify the HMI system, potentially altering its intended functionality.
- **Loss of Confidentiality:** Sensitive information stored on the HMI could be accessed by the attacker.
- **Operational Failure:** The compromised device could lead to a disruption of operations dependent on the HMI.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Code Installation:** The primary attack vector involves an authenticated user installing malicious code onto the HMI product.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to install software onto the HMI system. This implies a level of access to the HMI.

**Summary**

The vulnerability is due to unmaintained third-party components. An attacker can gain full control of the HMI device by installing malicious code. This requires an authenticated user with the ability to install software to perform the attack. The impact is severe, including loss of control, integrity, and confidentiality, as well as potential operational failures.
