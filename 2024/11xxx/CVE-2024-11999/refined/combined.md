Schneider Electric Security Notification

Harmony HMI and Pro-face HMI products

10 December 2024

Overview

Schneider Electric is aware of a vulnerability in its Harmony HMIST6, HMISTM6, HMIG3U, HMIG3X, HMISTO7
products used with EcoStruxure™ Operator Terminal Expert Software and PFXST6000, PFXSTM6000,
PFXSP5000, PFXGP4100 products used with Pro-face BLUE Software.

Harmony HMI Panels and Pro-face HMI Panels are the main visible automation component that manage all
vital machine features, including visualization, control, supervision, diagnostics, monitoring, and data logging.

Failure to apply the mitigations provided below may risk various attack scenarios due to Third-Party
Component obsolescence, which could result in complete loss of control, Integrity and Confidentiality of the
device and operational failure.

Vulnerability Details

CVE ID: CVE-2024-11999

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 8.8 | High | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVSS v4.0 Base Score 8.7 | High | CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N

CWE-1104: Use of Unmaintained Third-Party Components vulnerability exists that could cause complete
control of the device when an authenticated user installs malicious code into HMI product.

The severity of vulnerabilities was calculated using the CVSS Base metrics for 4.0 (CVSS v4.0). CVSS v3.1
will be still evaluated until the adoption of CVSS v4.0 by the industry. The severity was calculated without
incorporating the Temporal and Environmental metrics. Schneider Electric recommends that customers score
the CVSS Environmental metrics, which are specific to end-user organizations, and consider factors such as
the presence of mitigations in that environment. Environmental metrics may refine the relative severity posed
by the vulnerabilities described in this document within a customer’s environment.

Customers should immediately apply the following mitigations to
reduce the risk of exploit:

•  Use HMI only in a protected environment to minimize network
exposure and ensure that they are not accessible from public
internet or untrusted networks.

•  Setup network segmentation and implement a firewall to block

all unauthorized access.

•  Restrict usage of unverifiable portable media

•  Restricting the application access to limit the transfer of

Firmware to HMI

•  Scanning of software/files for rootkits before usage and

verifying the digital signature.

•  When exchanging files over the network, use secure

communication protocols.

General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.

•  Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from

•

the business network.
Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control and safety
systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.

•  Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the “Program” mode.
•  Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for that device.
•  Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB drives, etc.

before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.

•  Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the intended network to

connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.

•  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that they are not

accessible from the Internet.

•  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).
Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version
available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.
