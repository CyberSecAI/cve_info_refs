- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the parsing of DJVU files, specifically due to the lack of validation of an object's existence before performing operations on it. This leads to a use-after-free condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-after-free. The software attempts to operate on a memory object after it has been freed, resulting in memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. This can lead to full system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted malicious DJVU file. Attackers can either entice users to open the file directly, or redirect the user to a malicious page which in turn loads the file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers need to be able to deliver the malicious DJVU file to the victim. User interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability, as the victim must open the malicious file.
