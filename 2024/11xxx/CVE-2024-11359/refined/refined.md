Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-11359:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the improper use of `add_query_arg` without proper escaping on the URL. This allows the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into a page. This script would execute if a user clicks a malicious link crafted by the attacker, potentially leading to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of web pages
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites
  - Stealing sensitive information
  - Other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through crafted URLs containing malicious JavaScript.
- An attacker would need to trick a user into clicking on the malicious link for the injected script to execute in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker must be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs to rely on social engineering or other means to get a user to click on the malicious link.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `class-bookshelves-settings.php` file of the Library Bookshelves WordPress plugin. Specifically, the vulnerable code is within the function that generates the settings page tabs where  `add_query_arg` was used without escaping.
- The vulnerable code has been patched in version 5.9 of the plugin, which introduces `esc_url_raw` to escape the URL, preventing XSS injection.
- The Wordfence vulnerability database lists the vulnerability as a medium severity issue with a CVSS score of 6.1.
