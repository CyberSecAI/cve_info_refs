Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11898

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the 'swin-campaign' shortcode of the "Scratch & Win â€“ Giveaways and Contests" WordPress plugin. User-supplied attributes for this shortcode are not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject malicious web scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied attributes within the 'swin-campaign' shortcode.
-   **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The plugin does not adequately escape output, allowing injected scripts to execute in a user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Arbitrary Script Execution:**  An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages that use the vulnerable shortcode.
-   **User Compromise:** When a user views the page with the injected script, the script will execute, potentially leading to:
    -   Session hijacking
    -   Malware distribution
    -   Phishing attacks
    -   Defacement of the website
-  **Privilege Escalation:** While the immediate impact is on any user viewing the page, a successful XSS attack can lead to the attacker gaining more control over the site if they manage to compromise an admin account.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Shortcode Injection:** The primary attack vector is the injection of malicious scripts into the attributes of the `swin-campaign` shortcode.
-   **Page/Post Insertion:** Attackers can insert these malicious shortcodes into WordPress pages or posts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Authenticated Contributor Access:** The attacker must have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site to create or edit pages/posts.
-   **Shortcode Usage:** Attackers need the ability to insert the `swin-campaign` shortcode in a post/page.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 2.6.9.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 2.7.0.
- The provided content includes links to the specific code changes that fixed this vulnerability, which involved sanitizing the 'id' attribute of the shortcode to only allow alphanumeric characters and underscores.
