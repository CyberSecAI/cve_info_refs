| I found SQL Injection bug on id parameter. Below is the steps to reproduce.   1. Click on UI-O-Matic module 2. Click any one entry and capture the request. 3. A GET request will be generated with the filepath '\*/uiomatic/object/GetById?typeAlias=cities&id=10' 4. Enter the payload (%20waitfor%20delay'0%3a0%3a10'--) 5. It can be seen that the application will respond back within the specified time as per payload.   Let me know if anything is required. |
