The provided content relates to CVE-2024-11100.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the 'index.php' file of the 'Beauty Parlour Management System PHP SQLite Project'. The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization/validation of the 'name' parameter, which allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is a time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize user input, specifically the 'name' parameter, before using it in SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted POST request to the 'index.php' file. The attacker injects malicious SQL code via the 'name' parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not need any login or authorization to exploit this vulnerability, and is able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. The attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the server. The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable parameter name and the SQL injection type.
