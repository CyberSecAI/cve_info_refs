- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect default file and folder permissions. The NetCloud Exchange client for Windows, version 1.110.50, has insecure permissions set on certain installation directories.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Insecure file and folder permissions, specifically "full control" permissions for the 'Everyone' group on installation paths.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Privilege escalation, arbitrary code execution, and persistence on the compromised machine. A normal, non-admin user can exploit these permissions to gain elevated privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the operating system. Any user with local access can exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A non-admin user with local access to the Windows machine where the vulnerable software is installed.
