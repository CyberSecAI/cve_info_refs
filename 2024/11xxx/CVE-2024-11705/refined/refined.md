{
  "CVE-2024-11705": {
    "description": "`NSC_DeriveKey` inadvertently assumed that the `phKey` parameter is always non-NULL. When it was passed as NULL, a segmentation fault (SEGV) occurred, leading to crashes. This behavior conflicted with the PKCS#11 v3.0 specification, which allows `phKey` to be NULL for certain mechanisms.",
    "root_cause": "The `NSC_DeriveKey` function incorrectly assumes that the `phKey` parameter will always have a valid memory address and doesn't handle cases where it's NULL.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A segmentation fault (SEGV) will occur, causing the application to crash.",
    "attack_vectors": "By passing a NULL value as the `phKey` parameter to the `NSC_DeriveKey` function.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker must be able to influence the `phKey` parameter passed to `NSC_DeriveKey`."
