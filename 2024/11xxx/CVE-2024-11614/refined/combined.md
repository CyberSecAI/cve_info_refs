# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via

Subject: CVE-2024-11614: DPDK Vhost Rx checksum vulnerability

A vulnerability was fixed in DPDK.

Some downstream stakeholders were warned in advance through
security-prerelease@...k.org in order to coordinate the release
of fixes and reduce the vulnerability window [0].

A malicious guest using a virtio driver can cause the vhost-user side to
crash by sending a packet with a Tx checksum offload request and an
invalid csum_start offset.
