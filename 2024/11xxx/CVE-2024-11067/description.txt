The D-Link DSL6740C modem has a Path Traversal Vulnerability, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary system files. Additionally, since the device's default password is a combination of the MAC address, attackers can obtain the MAC address through this vulnerability and attempt to log in to the device using the default password.
