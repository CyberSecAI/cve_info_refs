Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11225

**Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the plugin's improper use of the `add_query_arg` function without proper sanitization or escaping of user-supplied input. This occurs when generating URLs, specifically in the functions `wpdmpp_head` (line 584) and `wpdmpp_cart_page` (line 420) where query arguments are added to URLs without sanitization and escaping.

**Weaknesses:**
- Lack of output sanitization/escaping: User-controlled input is directly used in the generation of URLs, making it vulnerable to injection of malicious scripts

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the vulnerable pages.
- This malicious code can then be executed in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing cookies or sensitive information.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website
    - Other malicious activities

**Attack Vector:**
- The attack vector is through crafted URLs containing malicious JavaScript code in query parameters.
- An attacker would need to trick a user into clicking on a malicious link. This link could be disseminated through various methods such as phishing emails, social media posts, or malicious websites.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**
- The attacker does not require any authentication or special privileges.
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL and convince a user to click it.
- The attacker doesn't need access to the server or any kind of authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Affected Versions:**
- All versions of the plugin up to and including 5.9.3 are vulnerable.

**Remediation:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 5.9.4 and later. Users should update to the latest version of the plugin to mitigate this risk.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Wordfence report also mentions an input sanitization issue in the `[wpdmpp_pay_link]` shortcode, fixed in 5.9.4
- The code snippet provided includes a fix for the currency sign issue, unrelated to this XSS vulnerability
