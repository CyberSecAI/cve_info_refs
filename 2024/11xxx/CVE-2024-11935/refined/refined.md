Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11935

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of sufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the 'class' parameter of the `obfuscate_email` shortcode provided by the "Email Address Obfuscation" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin does not properly sanitize or escape the input provided in the `class` parameter of the `obfuscate_email` shortcode, allowing for the injection of arbitrary web scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into pages on the affected WordPress site.
- **Compromised User Experience:** When a user visits a page containing the injected script, the malicious code will execute in their browser.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:**  This can lead to a variety of attacks including session hijacking, cookie theft, redirecting users to malicious websites, and defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode Injection:** Attackers inject the malicious script by crafting a `obfuscate_email` shortcode with a malicious value in the `class` attribute.
    `[obfuscate_email email="test@example.com" link=true class="malicious-code"]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:**  The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site with at least Contributor-level access.
- **Ability to post content:** The attacker must have the ability to create or edit posts/pages or any content that allows the use of shortcodes

**More Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.0.1.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.1.0 by sanitizing the `class` parameter using `esc_attr()`
- The vulnerability was reported by theviper17y.
