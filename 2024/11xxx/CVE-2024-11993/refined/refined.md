- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to unsanitized input in the "Dispatch Name" field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected XSS.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary web script or HTML in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various attacks, including session hijacking, defacement, and redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the "Dispatch Name" field, which is vulnerable to reflected XSS. An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript code in the "Dispatch Name" parameter and trick a user into clicking on it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link and trick a user to click it. The user needs to have a high privilege on the system (PR:H). User interaction is also required (UI:A).
