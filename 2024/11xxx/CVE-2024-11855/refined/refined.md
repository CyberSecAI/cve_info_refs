Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11855

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `height` parameter within the `koalendar` shortcode in the Koalendar – Events & Appointments Booking Calendar WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses a page containing the injected shortcode, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Defacement of the website
    - Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by injecting malicious JavaScript code through the `height` attribute of the `koalendar` shortcode.
- This is achieved by a user with contributor-level access or higher.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
- They need the ability to create or edit content (posts, pages) and insert shortcodes into them.

**Technical Details:**
- The `koa-wordpress.php` file handles the shortcode.
- The `embed_koalendar` function extracts attributes, including `height`, from the shortcode.
- While the `link` attribute is sanitized with `esc_url`, the `height` attribute is only sanitized with `esc_attr( sanitize_text_field())`, which is insufficient to prevent XSS as it does not escape HTML entities.
- The function then directly injects this unsanitized `height` attribute into the `<iframe>` tag, which results in the XSS vulnerability.
- The vulnerable code snippet can be located at line 29 in the `koa-wordpress.php` file.

**Affected Versions:**
- All versions of the Koalendar – Events & Appointments Booking Calendar plugin up to and including 1.0.2 are vulnerable.

**Patched Version:**
- Version 1.0.3 of the plugin has patched this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on December 13, 2024, and was last updated on December 17, 2024.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Peter Thaleikis.
