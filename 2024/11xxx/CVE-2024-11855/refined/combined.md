## Description

Koalendar is an all-in-one appointment scheduling & online booking system with a free & easy-to-use WordPress plugin.

Koalendar will help you run your business more efficiently by allowing your clients to book and manage their own appointments without interrupting you with phone calls. Rid your business of wasted time spent on admin.

Reduce no-shows by up to 90% with automated appointment reminders sent via email. Remind clients and staff alike of their upcoming appointments, eliminate confusion and provide better customer experience.

Use the [Koalendar] short tag on any page with the options described in the documentation to embed your customized booking flow.

Create your free account in just minutes: [Koalendar.com](https://Koalendar.com/login?utm_source=wp_plugin)

### Documentation

This creates the [koalendar] tag to embed Koalendar into the page. Usage:

[koalendar link=”YOUR-BOOKING-PAGE-LINK”]

1. Create a free account at [Koalendar.com](https://Koalendar.com/login?utm_source=wp_plugin)
2. [Create a booking page](https://Koalendar.com/e/new?utm_source=wp_plugin).
3. Get your booking page link to paste into the [koalendar] tag by clicking “Share” next to the booking page, and “Copy link”.

Options:

link: your booking page (required)

width: defaults to 100% (optional)

height: defaults to 660px (optional)

We recommend adding the tag in text mode instead of visual to prevent other formatting of the URL being

inadvertently added. Support is available at https://help.koalendar.com/

### Description

The Koalendar – Events & Appointments Booking Calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘height’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
