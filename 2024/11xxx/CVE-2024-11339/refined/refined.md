Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-11339:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the 'spb-button' shortcode of the Smart PopUp Blaster WordPress plugin. User-supplied attributes are not properly sanitized before being rendered into the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of proper sanitization allows for the injection of arbitrary web scripts through shortcode attributes. These scripts are then stored in the database and executed when a user views the page containing the malicious shortcode.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not sanitize the attributes of the 'spb-button' shortcode.
- **Lack of Output Escaping:** The plugin does not escape the shortcode attributes before using them in HTML, allowing for script injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they view a page containing the injected malicious shortcode.
- **Website compromise:** This can lead to various malicious activities, including but not limited to, cookie stealing, redirection to malicious sites, session hijacking, account takeover, or defacement of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the 'spb-button' shortcode attributes.
- An attacker can inject malicious script in the `class`, `text` or `id` attributes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This level of access allows users to create and edit posts or pages where they can insert the malicious shortcode.
- **Knowledge of Shortcode:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable shortcode `spb-button` and its attributes.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided code snippet from `shortcodes.php` shows the vulnerable code directly using user-supplied attributes within HTML attributes without sanitization:
  ```php
  $button .= ' class="show-popup ' . $atts['class'] . '"';
  $button .= ' data-id="' . $atts['id'] . '">';
  $button .= $atts['text'];
  ```
- There is currently no patch available for this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability affects all versions up to and including version 1.4.3 of the Smart PopUp Blaster plugin.
