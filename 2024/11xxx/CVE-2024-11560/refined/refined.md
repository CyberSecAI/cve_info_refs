- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing DXF files, leading to a memory corruption condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory corruption vulnerability due to insufficient input validation when parsing DXF files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** Attackers can exploit this by enticing a user to open a malicious DXF file or visit a malicious web page containing a crafted DXF file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious DXF file to the victim, either through direct file access or via a webpage that the victim accesses. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability, i.e., the user must open the crafted file or visit the malicious page.
