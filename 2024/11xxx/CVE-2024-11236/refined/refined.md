- Root cause of vulnerability: Integer overflow in the calculation of the length of the quoted string in the firebird and dblib PDO drivers. The `quotedlen` variable can overflow if the input string has a large number of single quotes, or can become a value over `ZSTR_MAX_LEN`, leading to an out-of-bounds write.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Integer overflow leading to out-of-bounds write.
- Impact of exploitation: Out-of-bounds write which can potentially lead to code execution or other memory corruption issues.
- Attack vectors: By providing a crafted string with a large number of single quotes as input to the affected functions (within the PDO firebird and dblib drivers)
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to pass user controlled data to the vulnerable functions.
