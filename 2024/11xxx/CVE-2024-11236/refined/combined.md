## Description

### Impact

The following code:

[php-src/ext/pdo\_firebird/firebird\_driver.c](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/5070fbf1613015e351bc4629ac7997b26359320b/ext/pdo_firebird/firebird_driver.c#L805-L808)

Lines 805 to 808
in
[5070fbf](/php/php-src/commit/5070fbf1613015e351bc4629ac7997b26359320b)

|  | for (co = ZSTR\_VAL(unquoted); (co = strchr(co,'\'')); qcount++, co++); |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
|  | quotedlen = ZSTR\_LEN(unquoted) + qcount + 2; |
|  | quoted\_str = zend\_string\_alloc(quotedlen, 0); |

and the following code:

[php-src/ext/pdo\_dblib/dblib\_driver.c](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/c34b37fe0b5c099fcf506c5400552d6bbb95cd79/ext/pdo_dblib/dblib_driver.c#L164-L174)

Lines 164 to 174
in
[c34b37f](/php/php-src/commit/c34b37fe0b5c099fcf506c5400552d6bbb95cd79)

|  | /\* Detect quoted length, adding extra char for doubled single quotes \*/ |
| --- | --- |
|  | for (i = 0; i < ZSTR\_LEN(unquoted); i++) { |
|  | if (ZSTR\_VAL(unquoted)[i] == '\'') ++quotedlen; |
|  | ++quotedlen; |
|  | } |
|  |  |
|  | quotedlen += 2; /\* +2 for opening, closing quotes \*/ |
|  | if (use\_national\_character\_set) { |
|  | ++quotedlen; /\* N prefix \*/ |
|  | } |
|  | quoted\_str = zend\_string\_alloc(quotedlen, 0); |

Can cause integer overflow, or can become a value over `ZSTR_MAX_LEN` causing an overflow, which eventually turns into an OOB write. This is triggerable on 32-bit especially.
