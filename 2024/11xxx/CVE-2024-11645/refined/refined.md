- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape user-supplied settings. Specifically, the "Ширина блока, px" (Block width, px) input field within the widget settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with administrative privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code into the widget settings, which will then be executed in the browsers of other users accessing the site.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must have administrative privileges to access and modify widget settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  Admin privileges are required. The attacker needs to access the widget settings and insert the malicious script into the vulnerable input field ("Ширина блока, px").
