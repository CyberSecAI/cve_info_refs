Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11219

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a path traversal issue in the `get_image` function of the `class-dynamic-content.php` file within the Otter Blocks plugin. The plugin uses user-supplied data to construct a file path, without proper sanitization or validation, leading to the potential to access files outside of the intended directories.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Path Traversal:** The core vulnerability is the improper handling of file paths. The `get_image` function in `class-dynamic-content.php` allows for the inclusion of a 'fallback' parameter that is not validated, allowing an attacker to navigate to arbitrary files on the server.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The plugin fails to properly validate and sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the 'fallback' parameter in the dynamic image functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Image View:** An unauthenticated attacker can access and view arbitrary images on the server. This could expose sensitive information if such images exist outside of the intended web directories.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The ability to view arbitrary images can lead to the disclosure of sensitive data, including server configurations or private documents if not properly secured.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Unauthenticated HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability can be exploited via a specially crafted HTTP request to the server, without requiring authentication. The attack is made by manipulating the 'fallback' parameter of a dynamic image block.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be logged into the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress site to send HTTP requests.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerable code is located in the `get_image` function within `class-dynamic-content.php` around line 222:
   ```php
   if (isset( $data['fallback'] ) && ! empty( $data['fallback'] ) ) {
      $value = esc_url( $data['fallback'] );
   }
   ```
*   The fix involves updating to version 3.0.7 or later of the Otter Blocks plugin.
