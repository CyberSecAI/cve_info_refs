Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-11361:

**1. Verification:**
   - The provided content from Wordfence directly references CVE-2024-11361 and describes a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "PDF Invoices & Packing Slips Generator for WooCommerce" plugin.
   - The vulnerability stems from improper neutralization of input during web page generation, which aligns with the CVE description.
   - The provided code snippets from the plugin's repository confirm the vulnerable locations.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is the improper use of the `add_query_arg` function without appropriate escaping of user-controlled input when generating URLs. Specifically, the vulnerability exists when creating URLs for document creation, viewing and printing functionalities.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to reflected XSS due to the lack of output encoding/sanitization in the generated URLs.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - Successful exploitation allows unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious web scripts into the pages.
   - If a user clicks on a crafted malicious link, the injected script will execute in their browser within the context of the vulnerable website.
   - This could result in:
      - Session hijacking
      - Stealing sensitive information (cookies, user data)
      - Redirecting the user to other malicious websites.
      - Performing actions on behalf of the user
      - Defacement of website

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - The attack vector is through malicious URLs. An attacker would need to craft a URL with malicious JavaScript payload embedded within the query parameters.
   - The attacker would then trick a user into clicking on the malicious link. This is typically achieved through social engineering or phishing.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing the malicious JavaScript payload.
   - The attacker needs to have the ability to trick a user into clicking the malicious link.
   - No authentication or privilege escalation is required to perform this attack.
