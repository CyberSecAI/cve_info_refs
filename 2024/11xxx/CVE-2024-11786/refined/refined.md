Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-11786:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The provided content, especially the Wordfence article, explicitly mentions "CVE-2024-11786" and describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Login with Vipps and MobilePay" plugin, aligning with the CVE ID.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `continue-with-vipps` shortcode. This allows an attacker to inject malicious web scripts.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize or escape the attributes of the `continue-with-vipps` shortcode, making it vulnerable to stored XSS attacks.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and store malicious JavaScript code into a page.
   - **Compromise of User Accounts:** When other users visit the page with injected code, the scripts will execute in their browsers. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, or other malicious activities, potentially compromising user accounts.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Shortcode Injection:** Attackers inject malicious scripts via the attributes of the `continue-with-vipps` shortcode.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "Contributor" level access or higher to be able to create and edit pages/posts and use shortcodes.

**7. Technical Details:**
   - The vulnerability is located in the `login_button_html` function in the `VippsLogin.class.php` file, specifically at line 724.
   - The vulnerable code does not sanitize the `$application` variable before using it in the `href` attribute of the button.
   - The code also doesn't use `esc_attr()` and `esc_html()` on attributes like `class`, `title` or the output of text and logo.
   - The fix involves sanitizing the `$application` variable with `preg_replace("![^a-zA-Z0-9-\_]!", "", $application);` and using `esc_attr()` and `esc_html()` functions on the output before rendering.

**Summary of extracted information:**

- **Vulnerability:** Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Affected Plugin:** Login with Vipps and MobilePay
- **Affected Versions:** <= 1.3.3
- **Vulnerable Code:**  `VippsLogin.class.php` line 724
- **Attack Vector:**  `continue-with-vipps` shortcode with unsanitized attributes.
- **Impact:** Arbitrary script execution, potential user account compromise.
- **Fix:** Plugin version 1.3.4 includes input sanitization and output escaping of the shortcode's attributes.
