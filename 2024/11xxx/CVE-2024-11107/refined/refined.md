- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape specific parameters when outputting them on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the browser of an administrator when viewing the vulnerable page. This could lead to the attacker gaining unauthorized access or control.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious payload is injected through a GET request to the website by appending a crafted URL parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs no authentication to exploit this vulnerability. They can send the crafted request from any location with network access to the vulnerable server.
