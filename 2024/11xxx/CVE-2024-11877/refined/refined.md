Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-11877:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the 'cricket_score' shortcode of the Cricket Live Score WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page via the shortcode attributes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Script Execution: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will execute in the browsers of users who view pages containing the vulnerable shortcode.
- Data Theft: The attacker can potentially steal sensitive information, such as session cookies or user credentials.
- Website Defacement: The attacker can modify the content of the webpage.
- Further attacks: The attacker may use the injection for more malicious purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the 'cricket_score' shortcode when used with crafted attributes.
- Attackers inject malicious scripts through the shortcode's attributes, which are then stored in the WordPress database.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be authenticated as a WordPress user with Contributor-level access or higher to be able to create or edit pages/posts and inject the malicious shortcode with the crafted attributes.
