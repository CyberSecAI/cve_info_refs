Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11461

**Root Cause:**
- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `page` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- The `page` parameter in the Form Data Collector plugin is not properly sanitized when being used to generate the HTML. This allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into the affected pages.
- If a user is tricked into clicking on a malicious link, the injected script will execute in their browser, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking.
    - Stealing of sensitive data.
    - Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
    - Other malicious actions within the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript code in the `page` parameter.
- The attacker would need to trick a user into clicking on this specially crafted link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a crafted link.
- The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking the malicious link.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `index.php` file of the plugin, specifically around line 165.
- The vulnerable code is:
  ```php
  echo '<input type="hidden" name="page" value="' . $_REQUEST['page'] . '" />';
  ```
- The fix was to sanitize the output using `esc_attr`:
  ```php
    echo '<input type="hidden" name="page" value="' . esc_attr($_REQUEST['page']) . '" />';
  ```
- The issue was fixed in version 2.2.4 by sanitizing the `$_REQUEST['page']` parameter before outputting it.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is considered a medium severity issue with a CVSS score of 6.1.
- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on December 2, 2024.
- The affected versions are up to and including 2.2.3 of the Form Data Collector plugin.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.4.
