Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the 'onlyoffice-docspace' shortcode of the ONLYOFFICE DocSpace WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-provided input used in the shortcode, allowing malicious code to be injected and stored within the WordPress site.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Web Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. When a user accesses these pages, the malicious scripts will execute in their browser, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Malware injection
    *   Website defacement
    *   Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Plugin Shortcode:** The vulnerability is triggered through the 'onlyoffice-docspace' shortcode within the WordPress plugin.
*   **User Supplied Attributes:** The attacker injects malicious code using attributes within the plugin's shortcode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "Contributor" level access or higher within the WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerable code is in `public/class-oodsp-public-docspace.php` where the attributes `align`, `width` and `height` are not sanitized before outputting them into the HTML.
* The fix involves using `sanitize_text_field` and `esc_attr` functions to sanitize the attributes before outputting them in the html.
