- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes of the 'stripe\_donation' shortcode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Authenticated attackers with contributor-level access or higher can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious code through the plugin's `stripe_donation` shortcode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
