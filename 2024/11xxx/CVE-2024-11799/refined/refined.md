```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data when parsing V8 files in the V-Simulator 5 component of Fuji Electric Tellus Lite. Specifically, the program copies user-supplied data to a fixed-length stack-based buffer without checking its size.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a malicious V8 file.  User interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious V8 file to a user of Fuji Electric Tellus Lite. The user must open this file for the attack to succeed."
