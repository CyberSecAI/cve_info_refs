**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of DXF files in IrfanView. This leads to a read operation past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The software reads data beyond the allocated buffer.
- Improper input validation: The application fails to validate user-supplied data within DXF files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current IrfanView process.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious file: An attacker can craft a malicious DXF file.
- Malicious page: An attacker can lure the victim to a malicious page hosting the malicious DXF file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious DXF file to a user of IrfanView.
- User interaction is required for exploitation as the user has to open the malicious DXF file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in IrfanView version 4.70 with plugins version 4.70.
