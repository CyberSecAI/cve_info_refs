### CVE-2024-11196
Based on the provided information, the vulnerability is a **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** issue in the Multi-column Tag Map WordPress plugin.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when handling user-supplied attributes within the plugin's `mctagmap` shortcode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** User-provided attributes in the `mctagmap` shortcode are not properly sanitized.
- **Lack of Output Escaping:** The plugin fails to properly escape user-controlled data before outputting it within the HTML context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses a page containing the injected code.
- This could lead to various malicious actions, including stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker exploits the plugin by inserting malicious code within the attributes of the `mctagmap` shortcode.
- The injected shortcode can be placed in any location that supports WordPress shortcodes, such as posts, pages, or widgets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with at least contributor-level access.
- With this level of access, they can create or modify content where shortcodes can be inserted.

**Additional Notes:**
- The plugin versions affected are up to and including 17.0.33.
- A patch is not yet available
- The plugin has been temporarily closed for download on WordPress.org
