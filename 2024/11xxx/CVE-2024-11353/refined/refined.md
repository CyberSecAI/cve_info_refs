- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing capability check on the `delete_message()` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing authorization check.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access or higher can delete arbitrary messages.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a request to the `delete_message()` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have an account with at least Subscriber-level privileges on the vulnerable WordPress site.

This content provides the source code for the vulnerable `clicksend-SMS-form-settings.php` file.
Specifically, the relevant code snippet is:
```php
    public function delete_message(){
        global $wpdb;
        $id = $_POST['id'];
        $table_name = $wpdb->prefix.'clicksend_leadcapture_messages';
        $deleted = $wpdb->delete($table_name,['id'=>$id]);
        if($deleted){
            $res = ["code"=>200,"message"=>"successfully deleted"];
            echo json_encode($res);
        }
        else{
            $res = ["code"=>401,"message"=>"error"];
            echo json_encode($res);
        }
        wp_die();
    }
```
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `delete_message` function lacks any capability checks, allowing any authenticated user to delete messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing authorization, direct database access for deletion with user-supplied ID.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Malicious actors can delete any message stored in the database.
- **Attack vectors**: The function is triggered via AJAX request, providing a vector for exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Authenticated access to the WordPress admin panel, with no specific role requirement is needed (subscriber+).
