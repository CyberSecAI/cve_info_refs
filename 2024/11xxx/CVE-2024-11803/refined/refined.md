- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of V8 files in the V-Simulator 5 component of Fuji Electric Tellus Lite. This results in a write past the end of an allocated data structure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data while parsing V8 files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves user interaction, specifically requiring the target to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file that contains a crafted V8 file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious page or file to the victim, who must then interact with it (either by visiting the page or opening the file).
