Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `/admin/network/wifi_schedule` interface of ENGENIUS routers. User-supplied data within parameters like `wifi_schedule_day_em_5` are directly passed to an `exec` function without any filtering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. Because user input is directly used as a system command, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands that the router will execute with the privileges of the web server (which typically runs as root).
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The system fails to validate and sanitize the input provided through parameters related to the wifi schedule interface, allowing malicious code to be injected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the affected router. This can lead to a variety of malicious outcomes.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Because the commands are executed with high privileges (potentially root), the attacker can gain complete control of the device.
*  **Data Breach**: Attacker can steal sensitive information stored on the router or intercept network traffic
*   **Malware Installation:** An attacker can install malware, botnets or other malicious software on the router.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could disable services or brick the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/luci/;stok=<token>/admin/network/wifi_schedule` endpoint.
*   **Modified `wifi_schedule_day_em_5` parameter:** The malicious command is injected into the request payload within parameters such as the `wifi_schedule_day_em_5` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the router's web interface. This could be from the local network or, if the management interface is exposed, from the internet.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the router's web admin interface (have valid `sysauth` cookie).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates using `curl` to contact a remote server, which confirms the ability to execute arbitrary commands.
*   The vulnerability affects "all versions, including the latest firmware version," implying a widespread vulnerability.
*   The vendor was contacted but did not respond.
