The provided content describes an open redirect vulnerability in Apereo CAS versions 6.6.x.

- **Root Cause:** The application does not properly validate user-supplied URLs used in redirects. Specifically, the `service` parameter in the login URL is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Open Redirect. The application accepts user-controlled input that can be used to redirect to arbitrary URLs without proper validation.
- **Impact of Exploitation:**
    - Indirect session hijacking by redirecting to malicious sites to steal session cookies.
    - Phishing attacks by redirecting to fake login pages to steal credentials.
    - Malware distribution by redirecting to malicious sites that host malware.
    - Reputational damage.
- **Attack Vectors:** Manipulating the `service` parameter of the login URL to redirect to an attacker-controlled URL.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with a `service` parameter that points to a malicious site.
    - No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability directly; however, the vulnerability allows an attacker to gain access to the user's session after the user authenticates, if the user clicks the crafted link.
