Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11092

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the SVGPlus WordPress plugin when handling SVG file uploads via the REST API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (specifically, SVG file content) before storing it. It also fails to escape the output when the SVG file is accessed/displayed. This allows malicious scripts embedded within an SVG file to be executed within the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts execute whenever a user accesses the malicious SVG file, potentially leading to various malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **REST API SVG File Uploads:** The vulnerability is triggered through the REST API by uploading a specially crafted SVG file containing malicious JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** Attackers need to be authenticated WordPress users with at least Author-level access.
*   **REST API Access:** Attackers need to be able to interact with the WordPress REST API to upload the malicious SVG file.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the SVGPlus plugin up to and including 1.1.0.
*   A patch is not yet available. The plugin has been closed (removed from the WordPress plugin directory) due to this security issue.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Francesco Carlucci.
