Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'page' parameter within the WordPress plugin "Drag & Drop Builder, Human Face Detector, Pre-built Templates, Spam Protection, User Email Notifications & more!".

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the 'page' parameter, before using it in the generation of a web page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. When a user is tricked into accessing a crafted URL, the injected script will execute in their browser. This can potentially lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirection to malicious websites
    - Information theft

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code within the 'page' parameter. An attacker would need to trick a user into clicking on this malicious link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL with a vulnerable `page` parameter.
- The attacker needs the ability to trick a user into clicking the malicious link.
