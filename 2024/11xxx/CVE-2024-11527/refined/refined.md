- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of DWG files. This leads to a memory corruption condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to open a malicious DWG file or visit a malicious page hosting such a file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious DWG file to the target and induce the user to open it using IrfanView. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
