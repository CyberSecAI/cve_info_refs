Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11442

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the 'horizontal-scroll-image-slideshow' shortcode. User-supplied attributes are not properly handled, leading to the injection of arbitrary web scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS because it fails to sanitize user-provided attributes used in the shortcode. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that will be stored in the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. When a user accesses a page containing the injected code, the malicious script executes in their browser.
*   **Potential for Malicious Actions:** This could lead to various malicious actions such as:
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Stealing cookies or session tokens.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    *   Defacing website content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Injection:** The attack vector is through the plugin's shortcode `horizontal-scroll-image-slideshow`. Attackers can inject malicious code through attributes of the shortcode, such as `dir`, `width`, `height`, `speed`, and `bgcolor`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Contributor Access:** An attacker needs at least contributor-level access to a WordPress site. This allows them to create and edit posts or pages where they can insert the malicious shortcode.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the "Horizontal scroll image slideshow" plugin up to and including version 10.1.
*   There is no known patch available.
*   The plugin has been temporarily closed on the WordPress plugin directory and is not available for download pending a full review.
*   The vulnerable code is located in the `horizontal-scroll-image-slideshow.php` file, specifically in the `hsis_show_shortcode` function, where the attributes are not properly sanitized.
*   The plugin uses a vulnerable version of JavaScript which has been deprecated.
