Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11888

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when processing user-supplied attributes within the `ider_login_button` shortcode of the "IDer Login for WordPress" plugin. This allows for the injection of malicious web scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Improper neutralization of input during web page generation

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- These scripts execute whenever a user accesses the compromised page.
- This can lead to various malicious activities, including but not limited to:
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to phishing sites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the plugin's `ider_login_button` shortcode.
- Malicious scripts are embedded within shortcode attributes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have at least "Contributor" level access or higher to the WordPress site. This means they must be able to create and edit posts/pages in order to inject the malicious shortcode.
- No special network position is needed.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including version 2.1.
- There is no known patch available.
- The plugin was closed on December 12, 2024, and is not available for download due to the security issue.

The identified file (`IDER_Shortcodes.php`) confirms the usage of `shortcode_atts` and lack of output encoding when displaying the attributes in HTML. The relevant code snippet is:
```php
return <<<EOT
<a class="{$a['class']}" href="{$site_url}" title="{$a['title']}" target="{$a['target']}">
<span class="ider-button-inside-wrapper">
<img src="{$plugin_url}assets/images/ider_logo_white_128.png"> {$logintext}
</span>
</a>
EOT;
```
and
```php
return <<<EOT
<a class="{$a['class']}" href="{$wp_logout_url}" title="{$a['title']}" target="{$a['target']}">
<span class="ider-button-inside-wrapper">
<img src="{$plugin_url}assets/images/ider_logo_white_128.png" /> {$logouttext}
</span>
</a>
EOT;
```
This demonstrates the lack of proper escaping of shortcode attributes `class`, `title` and `target` which can allow for XSS attacks.
