Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11433

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:**
* The vulnerability arises from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `sa-form` shortcode of the Surbma | SalesAutopilot Shortcode WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `listid`, `formid`, and `width` attributes passed to the shortcode are not properly sanitized or escaped before being used to generate the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not sanitize the `listid`, `formid`, and `width` attributes. This allows a malicious user to inject JavaScript code within these attributes.
* **Lack of Output Escaping:** The plugin does not properly escape the attribute values when generating the HTML. This results in the injected JavaScript being rendered as executable code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Arbitrary Web Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page using the vulnerable shortcode. When a user visits the page containing the injected shortcode, the JavaScript code executes in their browser.
* **Potential for Data Theft, Session Hijacking, etc.:** The executed JavaScript can perform actions on behalf of the user, including data theft, session hijacking, and other malicious activities.
* **Compromise of WordPress Site:** If the victim is an administrator, the attacker could potentially compromise the entire WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Shortcode Injection:** The primary attack vector is the plugin's `sa-form` shortcode. An attacker can inject JavaScript into the `listid`, `formid`, or `width` attributes of the shortcode.
* **Stored XSS:** The injected script is stored in the database and executes whenever a user visits the affected page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "Contributor" level access or higher. This means that they need the capability to create or edit posts/pages where shortcodes can be used.
* **Knowledge of Shortcode:** An attacker needs knowledge of how to use the `sa-form` shortcode.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability affects all versions of the Surbma | SalesAutopilot Shortcode plugin up to, and including, version 2.0.
* The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.1 by safely escaping the variables used in the shortcode.
* Version 2.2 introduced `rawurlencode()` instead of `urlencode()` to correctly encode URLs.
* The vulnerable code was present in the following line of `surbma-salesautopilot-shortcode.php`:
   ```php
   return '<div style="width: ' . esc_attr( $width ) . ';"><script type="text/javascript" src="https://d1ursyhqs5x9h1.cloudfront.net/sw/scripts/embed-iframe-form.js?listId=' . rawurlencode( $listid ) . '&formId=' . rawurlencode( $formid ) . '"></script></div>';
   ```
