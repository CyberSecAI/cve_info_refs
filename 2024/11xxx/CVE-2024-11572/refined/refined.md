- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the improper parsing of DXF files within IrfanView. Specifically, the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during DXF file parsing leads to a memory corruption condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to visit a malicious page or open a malicious DXF file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious DXF file to the target user. User interaction is required, as the target must either open the malicious file or visit a malicious webpage.
