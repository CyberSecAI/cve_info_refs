### Description:

This is a flexible, simple-to-use extension that is used to list the contents of any folder. This extension comprises of a component, a content plugin, an editor extender plugin, and a module.

The folder listing can be displayed in four (4) formats now:

1. Table
2. Unordered List
3. Paginated Table
4. Explorer View

There are many options for sorting the files and folders, and for displaying the file names. This plugin allows for displaying subfolders and viewing the contents of subfolders as well. The user can also click on subfolder name to show or hide its contents. The action to show or hide the contents is animated via either Mootools or jQuery.

### Support

Feel free to visit [my support site](http://support.michaelgilkes.com).

For version 3.0, several changes had to be made that affect backward compatibility. For new users, this is not a problem, but for existing users, you make have to make minor changes to your shortcode to get everything working as normal. We apologize for any inconvenience these changes may cause. Here are the changes:

1. Use of Spaces:

   The use of pipes '|' to separate shortcode properties/attributes was removed. Shortcode attributes are now separated by a space. So, you will have to change your shorcodes and use spaces instead. The Easy Listing editor extender comes in handy for that. For example:

   `{easyfolderlistingpro method='list'|folder='images'|collapse='1'}`

   Shold be changed to...

   `{easyfolderlistingpro method='list' folder='images' collapse='1'}`
2. Deprecated Shortcode Attributes:

   To accommodate jQuery, some of the property names were changed slightly. So, for example, if you are using "easing", you will have to either change it to jeasing or measing, depending on whether you are using jQuery or Mootools.

   There are other deprecated attributes such as offset. A full property/attribute list is located in the backend under the Help tab of the Dashboard.

*On November 1, 2022, CISA officially adopted FIRST Standard Definitions and Usage Guidance - Version 2.0 and will update this page to reflect the new version. See CISA's TLP 2.0 User Guide and TLP: Moving to Version 2.0 Fact Sheet for details.*

## Introduction

The Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) was created in order to facilitate greater sharing of information. TLP is a set of designations used to ensure that sensitive information is shared with the appropriate audience. It employs four colors to indicate expected sharing boundaries to be applied by the recipient(s). TLP only has four colors; any designations not listed in this standard are not considered valid by FIRST.

TLP provides a simple and intuitive schema for indicating when and how sensitive information can be shared, facilitating more frequent and effective collaboration. TLP is not a "control marking" or classification scheme. TLP was not designed to handle licensing terms, handling and encryption rules, and restrictions on action or instrumentation of information. TLP labels and their definitions are not intended to have any effect on freedom of information or "sunshine" laws in any jurisdiction.

TLP is optimized for ease of adoption, human readability and person-to-person sharing; it may be used in automated sharing exchanges but is not optimized for that use.

TLP is distinct from the Chatham House Rule (when a meeting, or part thereof, is held under the Chatham House Rule, participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed.), but may be used in conjunction if it is deemed appropriate by participants in an information exchange.

The source is responsible for ensuring that recipients of TLP information understand and can follow TLP sharing guidance.

If a recipient needs to share the information more widely than indicated by the original TLP designation, they must obtain explicit permission from the original source.

![Traffic Light Protocol RED](/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_small/public/2023-02/tlp_teaser_red.png?h=c653ff14&itok=QOt4tAAU)

### TLP: Red

**Not for disclosure, restricted to participants only.**

![Traffic Light Protocol AMBER STRICT](/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_small/public/2023-02/tlp_teaser_amber_strict.png?h=c653ff14&itok=Z3k0H6iW)

### TLP: Amber+Strict

**Limited disclosure, restricted to participants’ organization.**

![Traffic Light Protocol Amber](/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_small/public/2023-02/tlp_teaser_amber.png?h=c653ff14&itok=iqf0bzad)

### TLP: Amber

**Limited disclosure, restricted to participants’ organization and its clients (see Terminology Definitions).**

![Traffic Light Protocol Green](/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_small/public/2023-02/tlp_teaser_green.png?h=c653ff14&itok=zbArdsX9)

### TLP: Green

**Limited disclosure, restricted to the community.**

![Traffic Light Protocol Clear](/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_small/public/2023-02/tlp_teaser_clear.png?h=c653ff14&itok=0D6kLdeZ)

### TLP: Clear

**Disclosure is not limited.**

### TLP:Red

**When should it be used?** Sources may use TLP:RED when information cannot be effectively acted upon without significant risk for the privacy, reputation, or operations of the organizations involved. For the eyes and ears of individual recipients only, no further.

**How should it be shared?**Recipients may not share TLP:RED information with any parties outside of the specific exchange, meeting, or conversation in which it was originally disclosed. In the context of a meeting, for example, TLP:RED information is limited to those present at the meeting. In most circumstances, TLP:RED should be exchanged verbally or in person.

### TLP:Amber+Strict

**When should it be used?** Sources may use TLP:AMBER+STRICT when information requires support to be effectively acted upon, yet carries risk to privacy, reputation, or operations if shared outside of the organization.

**How should it be shared?**Recipients may share TLP:AMBER+STRICT information only with members of their own organization on a need-to-know basis to protect their organization and prevent further harm.

### TLP:Amber

**When should it be used?**Sources may use TLP:AMBER when information requires support to be effectively acted upon, yet carries risk to privacy, reputation, or operations if shared outside of the organizations involved. Note that TLP:AMBER+STRICT should be used to restrict sharing to the recipient organization only.

**How should it be shared?**Recipients may share TLP:AMBER information with members of their own organization and its clients on a need-to-know basis to protect their organization and its clients and prevent further harm.

### TLP:Green

**When should it be used?**Sources may use TLP:GREEN when information is useful to increase awareness within their wider community.

**How should it be shared?**Recipients may share TLP:GREEN information with peers and partner organizations within their community, but not via publicly accessible channels. Unless otherwise specified, TLP:GREEN information may not be shared outside of the cybersecurity or cyber defense community.

### TLP:Clear

**When should it be used?**Sources may use TLP:CLEAR when information carries minimal or no foreseeable risk of misuse, in accordance with applicable rules and procedures for public release.

**How should it be shared?**Recipients may share this information without restriction. Information is subject to standard copyright rules.

## Other Usage

### How to use TLP in email

TLP-designated email correspondence should indicate the TLP color of the information in the Subject line and in the body of the email, prior to the designated information itself. The TLP color must be in capital letters: TLP:RED, TLP:AMBER, TLP:GREEN, or TLP:CLEAR.

### How to use TLP in documents

TLP-designated documents should indicate the TLP color of the information in the header and footer of each page. To avoid confusion with existing control marking schemes, it is advisable to right-justify TLP designations. The TLP color should appear in capital letters and in 12 pt type or greater.

RGB:

TLP:RED : R=255, G=0, B=51, background: R=0, G=0, B=0

TLP:AMBER : R=255, G=192, B=0, background: R=0, G=0, B=0

TLP:GREEN : R=51, G=255, B=0, background: R=0, G=0, B=0

TLP:CLEAR : R=255, G=255, B=255, background: R=0, G=0, B=0

CMYK:

TLP:RED : C=0, M=100, Y=79, K=0, background: C=0, M=0, Y=0, K=100

TLP:AMBER : C=0, M=25, Y=100, K=0, background: C=0, M=0, Y=0, K=100

TLP:GREEN : C=79, M=0, Y=100, K=0, background: C=0, M=0, Y=0, K=100

TLP:CLEAR : C=0, M=0, Y=0, K=0, background: C=0, M=0, Y=0, K=100
