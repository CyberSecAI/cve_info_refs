### Description

The Schema App Structured Data plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of add\_query\_arg without appropriate escaping on the URL in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.4. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

## Description

**What does the Schema App Structured Data WordPress Plugin Do?**

The Schema App Structured Data WordPress Plugin automatically creates and deploys the default Schema.org Markup for your pages, posts, author, and other types of content on your WordPress site. By adding Schema Markup to your WordPress site, your pages will be eligible for rich results – allowing your site to stand out in search and get more clicks and conversions.

The plugin leverages the existing content on your site to automatically create and deploy the appropriate type of Schema Markup to your pages. Simply activate the plugin, add your business name and logo, and you’re done.

**What type of default Schema Markup is automatically created with the Schema App WordPress Plugin?**

* Page: https://schema.org/Article
* Post: https://schema.org/BlogPosting
* Search: https://search.org/SearchResultsPage
* Author: https://schema.org/ProfilePage
* Category: https://schema.org/CollectionPage
* Tag: https://schema.org/CollectionPage
* Blog: https://schema.org/Blog
* BreadcrumbList: https://schema.org/BreadcrumbList
* WebSite: https://schema.org/WebSite

The plugin also automatically adds Video Schema Markup for all YouTube Videos embedded on your page.

You can customize your Page and Post Schema Markup through the default settings (e.g. posts can default to NewsArticle) or by directly editing the generated JSON-LD for each page.

This plugin helped me to have a proper result in the Google structured data testing tool.
Before, I have duplicates of structure data
before I had errors.
Then, I installed this plugin and everything is gone.
Theme authors never accurately implement Structure data.
SEO plugin authors never accurately implement structure data.
