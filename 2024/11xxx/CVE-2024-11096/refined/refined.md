Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection vulnerability found in the `newProject.php` file of the Task_Manager_In_PHP application.
- The root cause is the direct use of the `projectName` parameter in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of input validation and sanitization of the `projectName` parameter before using it in a database query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious attacker could exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to perform various malicious actions.
- Potential impact includes:
    - **Data Breach:**  Extract sensitive information from the database.
    - **Data Manipulation:** Modify or delete data within the database.
    - **Privilege Escalation:** Potentially gain unauthorized access to the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to `newProject.php`.
- **Malicious `projectName` parameter:**  The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `projectName` parameter of the POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the `newProject.php` endpoint.
- The attacker does not need prior authentication to the application or database.
- The attacker must have knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious input.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided content includes a proof of concept (POC) demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability using `sqlmap`.
- The vulnerable parameter is `projectName`.
- The content specifies the vulnerable file as `newProject.php`.
- The content also shows the successful retrieval of the database name using the SQL injection.
