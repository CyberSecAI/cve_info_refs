Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper use of `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` functions without proper escaping of URL parameters within the WordPress plugin "استخراج محصولات ووکامرس برای آیسی" (isee-products-extractor).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied input that is reflected back to the user within the URL. Specifically, the add_query_arg and remove_query_arg functions are used to construct URLs, which are then displayed on the page, potentially including the unsanitized input. This allows for malicious JavaScript to be injected into the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into the affected page. If a user clicks on the crafted URL, the malicious script would execute in their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions such as:
    - Stealing cookies or session tokens
    - Redirecting the user to a malicious website
    - Modifying the page content
    - Performing actions on the user's behalf

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URLs:** Attackers would need to craft malicious URLs containing the XSS payload within the query parameters.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers would need to trick users into clicking on the crafted malicious URLs (e.g., through phishing emails, forum posts, or malicious advertisements).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No authentication is required:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers.
- **User interaction required:** The attack requires tricking a user into clicking a malicious link.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 2.1.3.
- The vulnerability has been patched in version 2.1.4.
- The vulnerable code can be found in the `admin/pages/products_list.php` file of the plugin.
