The Simple Page Access Restriction plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.29 via the WordPress core search feature. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data from posts that have been restricted to higher-level roles such as logged-in users.
