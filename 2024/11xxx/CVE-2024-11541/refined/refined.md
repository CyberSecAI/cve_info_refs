- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of DXF files in IrfanView, leading to a memory corruption condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation, leading to memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the IrfanView process, leading to potential full system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious DXF file. The user has to open the malicious file with the vulnerable software or visit a malicious page that triggers the parsing of a malicious DXF file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious DXF file. The attacker does not need a privileged position on the system but needs user interaction.
