Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11952

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Limited Local PHP File Inclusion vulnerability due to improper handling of a file path. The `style` parameter in the `testimonial-slider-item.php` file is used to construct a file path that is then included using the `include` statement.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The plugin does not properly sanitize or restrict the path provided through the 'style' parameter. This allows an attacker to manipulate the path to include arbitrary files on the server.
- **Unrestricted File Inclusion:** The `include` statement is used with a user-controlled path, which can lead to the inclusion of arbitrary files.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization**: The plugin uses `sanitize_file_name` which only sanitizes the file name, not the path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including arbitrary PHP files, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to complete system compromise.
- **Bypass Access Controls:** The vulnerability can be exploited to bypass access controls and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.
- **Data Breaches:** Attackers could obtain sensitive data, such as user credentials, database information, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Parameter:** The 'style' parameter in the shortcode attributes is the attack vector.
- **File Inclusion:** The vulnerable code directly includes a file based on the attacker-controlled 'style' parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with Contributor-level access or higher on the WordPress site. The WordPress administrator needs to grant this permission to the contributor user.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Plugin:** The attacker needs to know that the plugin is vulnerable and how to exploit the vulnerable parameter.
- **Ability to inject shortcodes:** The attacker needs to be able to create content with the vulnerable shortcode.

**Additional Notes**
- This vulnerability is specifically limited to PHP files on Windows environments.
- The issue has been patched in version 3.1 of the plugin.
- The vulnerability is found in the `testimonial-slider-item.php` file at line 28.
- The function `sanitize_file_name` is used to sanitize user input, but this function is insufficient to prevent path traversal because it does not sanitize the path, only the file name.
