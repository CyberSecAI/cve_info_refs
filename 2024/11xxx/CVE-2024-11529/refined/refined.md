- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of DWG files, which leads to an out-of-bounds read.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves a malicious DWG file or a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerability when opened using the affected IrfanView software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to deliver a malicious DWG file or lure the target to visit a malicious page. User interaction is required to open the malicious file or visit the malicious page.
