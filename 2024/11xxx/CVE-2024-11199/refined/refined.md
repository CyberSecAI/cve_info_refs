Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2024-11199:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the `rescue_progressbar` shortcode of the Rescue Shortcodes WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied attributes within the `rescue_progressbar` shortcode. This allows malicious scripts to be injected through the shortcode's attributes, which are then stored in the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious web scripts into a page, which will then be executed in the browser of any user accessing that page.
*   **Potential for Account Takeover, Data Theft:** Successfully exploited XSS vulnerabilities can lead to various malicious activities, including stealing user cookies or session tokens, redirecting users to malicious websites, and potentially even taking over user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the `rescue_progressbar` shortcode attributes.
*   An attacker crafts a malicious shortcode with the injected JavaScript payload in attributes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with at least Contributor-level access to a WordPress site running the vulnerable plugin. This allows the attacker to create or edit posts/pages where they can insert the malicious shortcode.
*   **Shortcode Insertion:** The attacker must be able to insert shortcodes into content on the website.

**Technical Details**
* The vulnerable code is located in `includes/shortcode-functions.php` within the plugin.
* The fix for this issue involves using `esc_attr()` and `esc_url()` to properly sanitize the output, rather than directly echoing the unsanitized values.
* Specifically, the changes in version 3.0 focus on using `esc_attr()` to escape attributes and `esc_url()` for URLs in multiple shortcode handlers, including those for spacing, highlights, buttons, boxes, columns, toggles, tabs, progress bars, and google maps.

In summary, the vulnerability is a Stored XSS caused by inadequate sanitization within the `rescue_progressbar` shortcode, which could allow authenticated users to inject malicious scripts. The fix involves properly sanitizing the shortcode attributes when generating the HTML output.
