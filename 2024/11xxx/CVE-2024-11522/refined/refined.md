- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of user-supplied data when parsing DXF files, leading to a memory corruption condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption due to lack of input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: Opening a malicious DXF file or visiting a malicious page that triggers the parsing of a malicious DXF file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious DXF file to the user. User interaction is required to open the malicious file or visit a malicious page.
