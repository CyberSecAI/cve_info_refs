Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11818

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `/signup.php` file of the "User Registration & Login and User Management System With admin panel" version 1.0.
- The vulnerability exists because the application directly uses the 'email' parameter from user input within SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of input validation and sanitization, allowing malicious SQL code to be injected via the 'email' parameter. This lack of proper handling allows manipulation of SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the application's database.
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database.
- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- **System Control:** In severe cases, attackers can gain comprehensive control of the system through the database.
- **Service Disruption:** Attackers can potentially disrupt the service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `/signup.php` file.
- The 'email' parameter within the POST request is used to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable `/signup.php` page.
- No login or authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker must craft a malicious payload within the `email` parameter.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates several SQL injection techniques:
  - **Boolean-based blind injection:** Using `RLIKE` to infer boolean results.
  - **Error-based injection:** Using `FLOOR` and `CONCAT` to generate errors that reveal information.
  - **Time-based blind injection:** Using `SLEEP` to introduce time delays to infer boolean results.
- The attacker uses tools like `sqlmap` to automate the injection process and extract data.

**Suggested Repair:**
- **Prepared statements and parameter binding:** Use prepared statements to separate SQL code from user-provided data.
- **Input validation and filtering:** Implement strict validation and filtering of user inputs.
- **Least privilege:** Ensure that the database user has minimum necessary permissions.
- **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular security audits to find and fix vulnerabilities.
