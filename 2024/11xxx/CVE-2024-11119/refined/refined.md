Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11119

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `gallery` shortcode of the BNE Gallery Extended plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-provided input in the `ids` attribute of the `[gallery]` shortcode. This allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:**  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page, which will execute whenever a user accesses the affected page. This can lead to various impacts, including:
  - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user cookies to impersonate logged-in users.
  - **Data Theft:** Redirecting users to malicious sites or harvesting sensitive information.
  - **Defacement:** Altering website content.
  - **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to download malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode Injection:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code within the `ids` attribute of the `[gallery]` shortcode.
- The vulnerability exists in the way the plugin processes the `ids` attribute in the `gallery_shortcode_hijack` function (specifically line 178 in `bne-gallery-extended.php`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site to create or edit posts/pages and insert the malicious shortcode.

**More Details:**
- The vulnerability exists because the `ids` attribute, used to specify the image IDs in the gallery, is not properly sanitized. An attacker can inject arbitrary code into this parameter.
- The fix is implemented in version 1.2.2 which involves sanitizing the shortcode image IDs attribute.
- The vulnerability is triggered because the image ID is directly concatenated into the `class` attribute of the `<li>` element without proper sanitization and output escaping on line 178: `$output .= '<li class="slide gallery-item image-id-'.$id.'">';`
- Similarly, the vulnerability exists on line 310 of `bne-gallery-extended.php`: `$output .= '<div class="gallery-single gallery-item image-id-'.$id.' col-'.$atts['columns'].'-masonry" style="margin-bottom: '.$atts['gutter'].'px; width: '.$grid_col_width.';">';`

The provided information clearly indicates a Stored XSS vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization.
