    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    *   Defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **'catch-popup' Shortcode:** The vulnerability is specifically located in the plugin's handling of the 'catch-popup' shortcode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level access to the WordPress website.
*   **Shortcode Usage:** The attacker needs to be able to create or edit posts/pages to insert the malicious shortcode with crafted attributes

**Additional Details:**
