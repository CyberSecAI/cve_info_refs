Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-11722:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization and preparation of the `orderby` parameter used in SQL queries within the "Frontend Admin" WordPress plugin. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The plugin fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `orderby` parameter within the plugin's SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code, modifying the intended query.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The plugin does not properly validate or escape the `orderby` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can leverage the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive data from the database, potentially including user credentials, configuration details, or other confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request:** The attack is performed via HTTP requests by manipulating the `orderby` parameter in the request URL. The plugin uses the unsanitized `$_REQUEST['orderby']` directly in SQL queries, allowing the attacker to inject malicious SQL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers.
- **Form Submission View Permission**:  An unauthenticated user needs to have been given permission to view form submissions.
- **Shortcode Usage:** The form submission shortcode must be added to a page.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

-   The vulnerable code was located in multiple files related to data retrieval and listing functionality.
- The vulnerability was fixed by replacing `esc_sql` with `sanitize_sql_orderby` for sanitizing the `orderby` parameter
