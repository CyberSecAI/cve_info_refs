- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists within the parsing of CGM files in IrfanView due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data. This can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**:  A remote attacker can exploit this by getting a target to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file (CGM file).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious CGM file or a link to it to the victim, requiring user interaction.
