## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Publications <= 1.2 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not escape filenames before outputting them back in the page, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. On the web server, run the command `touch "<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>.bib"
` in the plugin directory.
2. Access the URL: https://example.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-publications/bibtexbrowser.php?frameset&bib=
3. The XSS alert will be triggered.

### Affects Plugins
