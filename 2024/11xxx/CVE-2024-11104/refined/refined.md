Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-11104:

**1. Verification:**

*   The provided information directly relates to CVE-2024-11104. It describes a missing authorization vulnerability in the "Sky Addons for Elementor" WordPress plugin. The Wordfence article specifically names CVE-2024-11104 and details the vulnerability. The code diffs and file references from WordPress.org also point to the plugin and files involved in the issue.

**2. Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing capability check in the `save_options()` function within the plugin's admin settings. This function, which is intended to be used only by administrators, can be accessed by authenticated users with lower-level capabilities, specifically subscriber and above.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The core weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks in the `save_options()` function. This allows unauthorized users to call the function.
*   **Arbitrary Option Updates:** The `save_options()` function allows an attacker to update arbitrary plugin options in the WordPress database, as long as those options are stored as arrays.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By updating arbitrary plugin options, attackers could render parts of the website or the entire website unusable by modifying the settings for the affected plugin.
*   **Arbitrary Site Configuration Changes:** The ability to modify arbitrary options could lead to unpredictable behavior within the plugin and, potentially, other functionalities depending on the nature of the changes made. It is important to note that the impact is limited to option values that can be saved as arrays, according to the Wordfence article.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The attacker leverages HTTP POST requests to the WordPress backend via `wp_ajax_sky_save_option_data`.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attack requires an authenticated user account with at least subscriber-level permissions.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have a valid account on the vulnerable WordPress website. Any account with the subscriber role or higher is sufficient.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to access the WordPress backend, likely through the internet.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs the ability to craft HTTP POST requests with the required parameters.

**7. Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Sky Addons for Elementor plugin versions up to and including 2.6.2.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in version 2.6.3 by adding a capability check within the `save_options()` function.
*   The Wordfence report provides specific file and line numbers where the vulnerable code exists in the 2.6.1 version, as well as links to changesets containing the fix.
*   The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
