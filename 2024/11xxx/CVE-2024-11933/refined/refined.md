- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data length before copying it to a heap-based buffer during the parsing of X1 files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely. The target must open a malicious file or visit a malicious page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious X1 file or have the victim interact with a malicious page that can trigger the vulnerability via a malformed X1 file. User interaction is needed.
