### Description

The WordPress GDPR plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a missing capability check on the 'WordPress\_GDPR\_Data\_Delete::check\_action' function in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary users.
