The provided content relates to CVE-2024-11262.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Student Record Management System in C++ has multiple stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities due to the use of fixed-size char arrays for storing user input and file contents without proper length checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the "Add New Students" feature when assigning data to a fixed-size char array (data[15]) without length checks.
- Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the "View All Student Marks" feature when reading data into a fixed-size char array (data[20]) from a file without length checks.
- Lack of input length validation for both user input and file content.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program crashes due to memory access errors.
- Potential arbitrary code execution by overwriting control flow data on the stack.
- Data corruption in adjacent memory locations, leading to unpredictable program behavior and system instability.

**Attack vectors:**
- Providing input exceeding the size of the fixed-size char array during the "Add New Students" feature.
- Modifying the student_record.txt file to contain data exceeding the buffer limits for the "View All Student Marks" feature.
-  Crafting inputs to overwrite control flow data on the stack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application, either by providing direct input or by modifying the data files used by the application.
- Basic understanding of buffer overflow vulnerabilities and ability to craft suitable input.
