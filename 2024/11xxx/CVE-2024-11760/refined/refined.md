Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-11760:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `currency-converter-widget-pro` shortcode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input within shortcode attributes, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the website.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into a website page. This injected script will execute whenever a user accesses the compromised page.
- **Data Theft/Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially steal sensitive information (like session cookies), redirect users to malicious sites, modify page content, or perform other harmful actions through the injected script.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Shortcode Injection:** The vulnerability is triggered by using the `currency-converter-widget-pro` shortcode with malicious attributes.
- **User-Supplied Input:** The attributes of this shortcode are not properly sanitized allowing injection of malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This allows them to create or modify content where the malicious shortcode can be placed.
- **Knowledge of Shortcode:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable shortcode, `currency-converter-widget-pro`, and its attributes.
