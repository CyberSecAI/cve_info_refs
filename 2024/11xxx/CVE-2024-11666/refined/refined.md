{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The device beacons to a cloud infrastructure to check for commands to execute. This communication happens over an insecure channel since peer verification is disabled. The device's firmware contains multiple instances of connections over HTTPS with certificate validation explicitly disabled using curl and PHP code. The cloud server can send a command as a JSON payload that the device will execute.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure communication channel with disabled peer verification.",
      "Use of `curl` and PHP with `-k` option and `verify_peer` set to `false`, respectively.",
      "Unauthenticated access to MQTT broker allowing triggering of the beacon process.",
      "Lack of input sanitization on the server side when sending commands to be executed."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote unauthenticated users positioned on the network between an EV charger controller and the eCharge infrastructure can execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges on affected devices.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack",
      "Compromised cloud server infrastructure"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to intercept or manipulate network traffic between the device and the cloud infrastructure, or compromise the cloud infrastructure."
