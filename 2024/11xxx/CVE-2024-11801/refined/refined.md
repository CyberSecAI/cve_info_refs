{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing V8 files in the V-Simulator 5 component. This allows a write past the end of an allocated data structure.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds write vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a malicious file or page that the user interacts with.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious V8 file or page that the user opens or visits. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability."
