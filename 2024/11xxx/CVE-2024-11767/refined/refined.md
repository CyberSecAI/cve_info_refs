Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The `newsman_subscribe_widget` shortcode in the NewsmanApp WordPress plugin does not properly sanitize and escape user-supplied attributes. Specifically, the `formid` attribute within the shortcode is not being properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to sanitize user input provided through the `formid` attribute of the `newsman_subscribe_widget` shortcode.
- **Lack of Output Encoding:** The plugin does not properly escape the attribute value before rendering it within HTML, allowing injected script code to be executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page or post.
- **Session Hijacking/Cookie Theft:** Malicious scripts can be used to steal cookies, potentially hijacking user sessions.
- **Redirection:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites.
- **Defacement:** Attackers can modify the content of the page or post.
- **Malware Distribution:** Attackers can inject scripts that trigger the download of malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode Injection:** Attackers inject the malicious script through the `formid` attribute of the `newsman_subscribe_widget` shortcode within a page or post.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** Attackers need at least 'Contributor' level access to the WordPress site. This is because Contributor-level users can add shortcodes to the content they post.
- **Shortcode usage rights:** The attacker needs the ability to add and use shortcodes on a page or post.

**Technical Details from Code:**

The vulnerability is located within the `generateWidget` function (lines 1054-1073 of `newsmanapp.php`):

- **Vulnerable Code:**

```php
function generateWidget($atts){
    if(empty($atts) || !is_array($atts) || !array_key_exists("formid", $atts))
    {
        return '';
    }
    $atts["formid"] = sanitize_text_field($atts["formid"]); //Sanitizing
    $c = substr_count($atts["formid"], '-');
    //backwards compatible
    if($c == 2)
    {
        return '<div id="' . esc_attr($atts["formid"]) . '"></div>';
    }
    else{
        $atts["formid"] = str_replace("nzm-container-", '', $atts["formid"]);
        return '<script async src="https://retargeting.newsmanapp.com/js/embed-form.js" data-nzmform="' . esc_attr($atts["formid"]) . '"></script>';
    }
}
```
- **Vulnerability Explanation:** The `formid` attribute is passed through `sanitize_text_field()` function which will not remove all the malicious code. Then, the code outputs the sanitized value with `esc_attr` which prevent injection. However, this check is bypassed if the count of `-` is not 2.

**Patch Information:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.7.7 of the plugin.
- The patch added `esc_attr()` to the output of the `formid` attribute.
- The patch is also shown in the diff of commit 3205721, specifically the line changes within the `generateWidget` function.

**Summary:**

The NewsmanApp plugin versions 2.7.6 and earlier are vulnerable to Stored XSS because of improper sanitization and output escaping of user-provided data in the `formid` attribute within the shortcode. This can allow authenticated attackers with Contributor or higher-level access to inject malicious scripts, potentially leading to various security impacts. The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.7.7 by properly escaping the output using `esc_attr()`.
