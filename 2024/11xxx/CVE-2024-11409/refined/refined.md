- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the insecure deserialization of untrusted input from the `cs_all_photos_details` parameter within the Grid View Gallery plugin. This allows for PHP Object Injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is the deserialization of untrusted data leading to PHP Object Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to potentially delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code if a suitable POP chain exists within the environment (either within the vulnerable plugin or another plugin or theme installed on the target system).
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is reachable by authenticated users with Editor-level access or higher. The attack is performed by sending a malicious request containing the crafted serialized PHP object via the vulnerable parameter `cs_all_photos_details`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with at least Editor-level privileges within the WordPress environment. They can then exploit the vulnerability via network access. The attacker needs to be able to craft a serialized PHP object and send it through the vulnerable parameter.
