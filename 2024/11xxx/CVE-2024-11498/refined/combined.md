Also rewrite the implementation to use iterative checking instead of recursive checking of tree property values, to ensure stack usage is low.

Before, it was possible for appropriately-crafted files to use a significant amount of stack (in the order of hundreds of MB).

Sorry, something went wrong.

This is the Level 10 limit. In Level 5, the tree height limit is much smaller: 64. It's probably not really needed to verify the exact limits, but I'm not sure if e.g. the current encoder actually respects Level 5 limits while still producing Level 5 output, and if we don't check in the decoder then this will not be noticed.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Also rewrite the implementation to use iterative checking instead of
recursive checking of tree property values, to ensure stack usage is
low.

Before, it was possible for appropriately-crafted files to use a
significant amount of stack (in the order of hundreds of MB).
