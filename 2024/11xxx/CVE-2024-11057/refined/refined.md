The provided content is related to CVE-2024-11057.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `removeBranchResult.php` file of the 'Hospital Appointment System In PHP With Source Code'. The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `ID` parameter before using it in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly uses the user-supplied `ID` parameter in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation. The vulnerability is exploitable through boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based blind techniques.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to:
* Unauthorized database access.
* Sensitive data leakage.
* Data tampering.
* Comprehensive system control.
* Service interruption.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is the `ID` parameter in the `removeBranchResult.php` file via HTTP POST requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker doesn't need any login or authorization. They can directly make HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint with a crafted `ID` parameter. They can be in an unauthenticated position.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability is in the `removeBranchResult.php` file of the 'Hospital Appointment System In PHP With Source Code' version 1.0.
*   The provided content includes proof-of-concept (POC) payloads for boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based blind SQL injection techniques.
*   The content also contains screenshots of SQLmap output demonstrating exploitation of the vulnerability.
*   The suggested repair includes using prepared statements, input validation, minimizing database user permissions and regular security audits.
