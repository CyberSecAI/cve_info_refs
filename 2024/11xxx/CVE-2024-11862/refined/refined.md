- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Timing attacks on Galois Field multiplications within the `Devolutions.XTS.NET` package.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Vulnerable to timing attacks during Galois Field multiplications.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation effectively reduces the security of XTS mode to that of ECB mode, allowing block swapping, identification of identical blocks, and rendering half of the XTS key obsolete.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must have local access to the system where the vulnerable code is running but requires no special privileges. There is no user interaction requirement.
