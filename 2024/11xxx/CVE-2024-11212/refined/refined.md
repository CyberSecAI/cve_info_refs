Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `$barcode` variable in the `admin\fetch_product_details.php` file. This allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input (the `$barcode` variable) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Exposure:** An attacker could use SQL injection to access, modify, or delete data from the database.
- **Data Breach:** Sensitive information such as employee details, salary information, or other confidential data could be compromised.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to the application or system by manipulating the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to `admin/fetch_product_details.php` where the `barcode` parameter is sent with malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application.
- **Basic Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL syntax to craft a malicious payload to be inserted into the `barcode` parameter.
- **Ability to Intercept or Send Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to send or manipulate requests to the web server. This can be achieved through a browser or an HTTP client such as cURL or a proxy tool.

**Additional details:**
- The provided GitHub content includes a demonstration of using sqlmap to test and confirm the SQL injection vulnerability using the provided HTTP request and payload.
- The vulnerable application is identified as a Best Employee Management System in PHP
