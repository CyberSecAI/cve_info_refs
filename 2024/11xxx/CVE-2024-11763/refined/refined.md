Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `plezi` shortcode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided input when rendering the shortcode, allowing malicious scripts to be stored in the database.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not adequately sanitize the `form` attribute of the `plezi` shortcode.
- **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The plugin does not properly escape the `form` attribute when rendering the shortcode, leading to the execution of injected scripts when a user accesses the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- **Malicious Activity:** The injected scripts execute when a user accesses the affected page, potentially leading to a variety of malicious actions, such as session hijacking, data theft, and defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Shortcode Injection:** The attacker injects malicious code via the `form` attribute of the `plezi` shortcode.
- **Page Rendering:** When a user views the page containing the crafted shortcode, the malicious script is executed in the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
- **Ability to Create/Edit Content:** The attacker needs to have the ability to create or edit posts/pages where the `plezi` shortcode can be inserted.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability affects Plezi plugin versions up to and including 1.0.6.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 1.0.7.
- The vulnerable code is located in `includes/plz-admin.php` file around line 590, specifically within `plz_form_shortcode` function.
- The `form` attribute of the shortcode `[plezi form="your-form-id"]` is vulnerable.
