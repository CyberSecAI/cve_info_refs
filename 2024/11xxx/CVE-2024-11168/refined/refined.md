          "The vulnerability exists because the urlsplit() and urlparse() functions in the urllib.parse module failed to properly validate bracketed hosts.",
          "Specifically, the functions did not enforce that bracketed hosts must be valid IPv6 or IPvFuture addresses.",
          "This lack of proper validation can lead to SSRF attacks if a URL containing the malformed bracketed host is processed by multiple URL parsers.",
           "The vulnerability has been addressed by adding checks to ensure that bracketed hosts found by urlsplit are of IPv6 or IPvFuture format."
