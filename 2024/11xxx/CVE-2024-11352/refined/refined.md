**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the 'twentytwenty' shortcode of the TwentyTwenty WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the page containing the injected code, potentially leading to various malicious actions like session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, or defacement.

**Attack vectors:**
The 'twentytwenty' shortcode attributes are the attack vector. An authenticated attacker with contributor-level access (or higher) can inject malicious code using this shortcode.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be authenticated with contributor-level access or higher to inject the malicious shortcode into a page.
