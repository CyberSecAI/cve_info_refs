Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11512

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the parsing of WB1 files. Specifically, the IrfanView WBZ plugin does not properly validate data leading to an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Out-of-bounds Write:** The core issue is a write operation that goes beyond the allocated buffer's boundaries. This is caused by insufficient validation of input data when parsing WB1 files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the IrfanView process. This implies full control of the application and the ability to perform malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious File:** The primary attack vector involves opening a specially crafted malicious WB1 file by the user within IrfanView
*   **Malicious Webpage:** The vulnerability can be triggered if a user visits a webpage containing the malicious WB1 file. User interaction is thus needed for successful exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious WB1 file to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to induce the victim to open the malicious WB1 file with IrfanView or visit a web page containing the malicious file.
*   The attacker does not need any special privileges or to be on the local network for exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in IrfanView version 4.70 with plugins version 4.70.
*   The vulnerability was reported by ssongk of WHS WWW Team.
