### Summary of CVE-2024-11205
This CVE relates to a missing authorization vulnerability in the WPForms plugin for WordPress, versions 1.8.4 to 1.9.2.1. 

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a missing capability check on the `wpforms_is_admin_page` function. This function is used to determine if a user is on a WPForms admin page, and it was incorrectly allowing users with subscriber-level access to perform admin-level actions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing capability check on the `wpforms_is_admin_page` function.
- Inadequate authorization controls, allowing subscriber-level users to access functionalities intended for administrators.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An authenticated attacker with subscriber-level access or higher can:
- Refund payments
- Cancel subscriptions

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation occurs through crafted AJAX requests.
- The vulnerability resides in the plugin's AJAX handlers for refunds and subscription cancellations, which are accessible by lower-privileged users due to the flawed capability check.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated access to a WordPress website is required.
- The attacker must have at least subscriber-level privileges.
- No user interaction is required for the attack to be successful.
