The provided content describes a vulnerability related to session management in Apereo CAS (version 6.6.x)

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Session tokens remain valid even after a user logs out, due to the application failing to invalidate them server-side.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Session token does not expire after logout.
- Lack of server-side session invalidation upon logout.
- Session tokens can still be used to access protected resources after the user has logged out

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Session Hijacking: Attackers could use active session tokens to access accounts, impersonating users after they log out.
- Unauthorized Access: Attackers can retain access to restricted areas without needing to re-authenticate.
- Data Exposure: Sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized users who can continue to access a session after logout.
- Non-Compliance with Security Standards: Regulations often require active session termination upon logout, and failure to do so may result in compliance issues.
- Reputational Damage: Users may lose trust in the applicationâ€™s security.

**Attack vectors:**
- Obtaining a valid session token through legitimate login.
- Using the session token after the user has logged out.
- Replaying the session token to gain unauthorized access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid session token that was obtained prior to the logout of the legitimate user.
- The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the application using the stolen session token.
- The attacker does not need any special access, just a valid session token and the ability to replay it.
