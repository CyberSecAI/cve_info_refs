Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the 'animatedcounter' shortcode of the Animated Counters WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied attributes within the `animatedcounter` shortcode, allowing the injection of arbitrary web scripts.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin uses `filter_var` with `FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING`, which is not sufficient for preventing XSS. This filter does not remove HTML tags or special characters needed to prevent XSS.
*   **Lack of Output Escaping:** The plugin doesn't properly escape the user-controlled attributes when generating HTML output, allowing injected scripts to execute in the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:**  Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into pages that use the vulnerable shortcode. This code executes in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Other malicious activities within the user's browser session.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Shortcode Injection:** Attackers inject malicious scripts via crafted attributes within the `animatedcounter` shortcode. For example, the `css`, `id`, `color` or `size` attributes of the `animatedcounter` shortcode can be used to inject malicious code.
*   **Stored XSS:** The injected scripts are stored in the database and are executed each time a user visits the page containing the shortcode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site to create or modify content.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the Animated Counters plugin up to and including version 2.0.
*   The plugin has been temporarily closed on the WordPress Plugin Directory and is not available for download, pending a full review.
*  The specific line of code vulnerable is the return statement on line 32 `return  '<span class="animatedcounters'.$css.'"'.$id.' '.$style.' counter-lim="'.$count.'" data-duration="'.$duration.'"></span>';` in `animated-counters.php`
