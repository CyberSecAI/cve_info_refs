- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the parsing of X1 files within Fuji Electric Monitouch V-SFT. Specifically, there is a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing X1 files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists due to the improper validation of user-supplied data, leading to a write past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process on an affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a user opening a malicious X1 file, or visiting a malicious page that triggers the vulnerability. User interaction is required for the exploit.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious X1 file or a malicious page that triggers the vulnerability. The attacker can be remote, but must rely on user interaction for the initial exploit.
