{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing DXF files, which leads to an out-of-bounds write.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds write due to insufficient input validation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves a malicious DXF file that the user must open or be exposed to (e.g. via visiting a malicious web page).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted DXF file. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability (opening the malicious file). The attacker can be remote as the vulnerability can be triggered by a file downloaded from a website or sent via email."
