- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data when parsing V10 files, before copying it to a stack-based buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can achieve remote code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation requires user interaction, either by visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious V10 file or a malicious webpage to the user.
