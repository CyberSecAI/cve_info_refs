Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2024-11217:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `oauth-server` logs the OAuth2 client secret when the `logLevel` is set to `Debug` or higher for OIDC, GitHub, GitLab, and Google IDP login options.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** The client secret, which should be kept confidential, is being logged.
*   **Logging at Debug Level:**  Logging sensitive information at a debug level makes it easier to accidentally expose the secret, since debug logs are often enabled during troubleshooting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Compromise of Client Credentials:** An attacker with access to the logs could obtain the client secret.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** With the client secret, an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the related services, resources, or data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Log Access:** An attacker would need access to the system's logs where `oauth-server` is running and logging at a `Debug` or higher level.
*   **Insider Threat:** An internal actor with access to the logs could discover the client secret.
*   **Compromised System:** An attacker who has compromised the system could also access the logs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Log Access:** The attacker must be able to access the system's logs where the client secret is being logged by `oauth-server`.
*   **Knowledge of Log Location:** The attacker should be aware of where `oauth-server` is logging its debug messages.
*   **Log Parsing Ability:** The attacker should be able to read and parse the logs to extract the client secret.
