- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Travel Tour theme fails to sanitize and escape a parameter (`tour-search`) before outputting it back to the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page that will be executed in the context of a user's browser. This can lead to: session hijacking, defacement of the website, redirection to malicious sites, stealing of sensitive information, etc. The vulnerability could be used against high-privilege users such as admins, potentially leading to complete site compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL that includes a payload in the `tour-search` parameter, an attacker can induce a victim to execute the malicious script by visiting the crafted URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL and convince a victim to access it. The victim's browser must be vulnerable to XSS attacks.
