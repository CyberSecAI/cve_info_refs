Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is an absolute path traversal issue due to "incorrect restriction of a path to a restricted directory" within the EasyPHP web server.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is a CWE-22 vulnerability, which means improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory. This allows an attacker to traverse directories outside the intended web root.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows remote users to bypass `SecurityManager` restrictions and retrieve any file stored on the server. It's a confidentiality issue as attackers can access sensitive files.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). The vulnerability is triggered by sending crafted requests containing consecutive strings `/...%5c`. This appears to bypass the intended path restrictions.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have low privileges (PR:L), and no user interaction is required (UI:N).

**Additional details not explicitly in the CVE description:**

*   The specific method of exploitation involves using `/...%5c` sequences in the request to bypass the `SecurityManager`.
*   The affected version is EasyPHP web server version 14.1
*   The CVSS score is 6.5 with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, highlighting the high confidentiality impact.
*   There is no known solution or patch available at this time.
