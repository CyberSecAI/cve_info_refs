### CVE-2024-11183

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Simple Side Tab plugin fails to sanitize and escape user input in the "Position from top (px)" parameter (`rum_sst_plugin_options[pixels_from_top]`) within the plugin's settings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin does not properly validate or sanitize user-provided input before storing and displaying it. This allows the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the browsers of users who access the affected pages or settings. This can lead to:
   - Session hijacking
   - Credential theft
   - Backdoor creation, potentially leading to unauthorized access and full site compromise.

**Attack vectors:** 
   - The attack vector is through the "Position from top (px)" setting within the plugin's admin settings panel.
   - An attacker needs to have at least administrator-level access to the WordPress dashboard to modify the plugin settings.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker needs to be a WordPress administrator or have equivalent privileges to access and modify plugin settings.
  - The attacker needs to be able to access the plugin's settings page to inject the malicious script.

**Technical Details:**
  - The vulnerable parameter is `rum_sst_plugin_options[pixels_from_top]`.
  - A proof of concept payload is `150"onmouseover='alert(1)'`.
  - The XSS is triggered when the field is interacted with (e.g., the mouse hovers over the field containing the injected payload).

**Additional Notes:**
   - The vulnerability is categorized as a Stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is stored in the database and executed when the affected setting is accessed, rather than being immediately reflected back to the user.
   - The vulnerability is present in versions of the Simple Side Tab plugin prior to 2.2.0.
   - This vulnerability can be exploited even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed, which makes it particularly dangerous in multisite WordPress setups.
