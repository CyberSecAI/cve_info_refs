  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to the improper handling of the `ks` parameter. This parameter is directly concatenated into the HTML output without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.",

      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "If a administrator accesses the malicious URL, the cookie may be obtained by an attacker.",
     "attack_vector": "The attack can be launched remotely by injecting a malicious script via the `ks` parameter of the file `/index.php/admin/web/useradmin.html`",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send a crafted URL to the victim. The attacker must also have knowledge of a vulnerable instance of the 115cms product."
