The provided content contains information about a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Best House Rental Management System Project in PHP v1.0". This aligns with the general description of CVE-2024-11742, which would be a vulnerability related to cross-site scripting, given the placeholder.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `save_tenant` function in `admin_class.php` does not properly sanitize the `firstname` and `lastname` parameters before storing them in the database.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). User-supplied input is not validated or sanitized allowing for malicious JavaScript code injection.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript that will execute in the browsers of any user who accesses the tenants' page. This could lead to:
    *   Theft of session cookies or user credentials.
    *   Unauthorized actions on behalf of users.
    *   Malicious redirection or delivery of malicious content.
*   **Attack vectors**: A malicious POST request is sent to the `/rental/ajax.php?action=save_tenant` endpoint with a crafted `firstname` and `lastname` fields including malicious JavaScript.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint, which would likely require being authenticated to the web application as a user who has permission to add tenants.
