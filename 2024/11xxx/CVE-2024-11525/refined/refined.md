{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to a lack of validation of the existence of an object before operations are performed on it during the parsing of DXF files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use-after-free vulnerability",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a specially crafted malicious DXF file or visits a malicious web page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to create a malicious DXF file or host a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerability. User interaction (opening the file or visiting the page) is required for exploitation."
