Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause of the SQL injection vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `adminname` parameter in the `/admin/admin-profile.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through this parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw. The application directly uses user-supplied input within an SQL query without any prior sanitization, allowing manipulation of the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized Database Access: Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- Sensitive Data Leakage: Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.
- Data Tampering: Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- System Control: Attackers can gain comprehensive control over the system.
- Service Interruption: Attackers can potentially cause a denial-of-service by disrupting the database or system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP POST Request: The vulnerability is exploited via an HTTP POST request to the `/admin/admin-profile.php` file.
- Malicious Parameter: The attacker injects malicious SQL code through the `adminname` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No login required: The attacker does not need to be logged in or authorized to exploit the vulnerability.
- Network access: The attacker needs network access to send the crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable web application.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable Parameter: `adminname` (POST parameter).
- Vulnerable File: `/admin/admin-profile.php`.
- Example Payload:
    - `adminname=miral' WHERE 5186=5186 AND 1779=(SELECT (CASE WHEN (1779=1779) THEN 1779 ELSE (SELECT 2512 UNION SELECT 5931) END))-- -` (boolean-based blind SQLi)
    - `adminname=miral' WHERE 3702=3702 AND (SELECT 5784 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))QZUE)-- YQpv` (time-based blind SQLi)
- The provided `sqlmap` command demonstrates how the vulnerability can be automatically exploited using a SQL injection testing tool.
- The vulnerability exists in version V1.0 of the software.

**Mitigation:**
The following mitigation strategies are suggested:
1.  Use prepared statements with parameter binding to prevent SQL injection.
2.  Implement strict input validation and filtering of user-provided data.
3.  Minimize database user permissions and avoid using highly privileged accounts.
4.  Conduct regular security audits to detect and fix vulnerabilities.
