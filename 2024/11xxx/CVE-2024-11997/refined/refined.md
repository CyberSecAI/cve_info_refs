Based on the provided information, this content relates to **CVE-2024-11997**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in the `vendas.php` file of the "farmacia-in-php" project. Specifically, the `notaFiscal` parameter obtained from the GET request is directly echoed into an HTML input field without any filtering or encoding.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application does not sanitize the user-supplied `notaFiscal` GET parameter before displaying it in the HTML of `vendas.php`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the vulnerable page by manipulating the `notaFiscal` parameter.
- The injected script can perform actions such as:
    - Redirect users to malicious websites (phishing).
    - Steal cookies and session tokens.
    - Modify the content of the page.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker manipulates the `notaFiscal` parameter in the URL.
- The vulnerable application renders this unsanitized parameter in the HTML.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious JavaScript code injected in the `notaFiscal` parameter.
- The victim needs to visit the malicious URL.
