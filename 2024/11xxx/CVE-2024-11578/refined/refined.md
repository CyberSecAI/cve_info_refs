- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data within the parsing of 3DS files, specifically before copying it to a stack-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a malicious 3DS file.
- User interaction is required, as the target must open a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious 3DS file.
- The attacker must trick the user into opening the malicious file.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is located within the `luxion_geometry_3ds.exe` component, which handles the parsing of 3DS files in KeyShot.
- The vulnerability is assigned CWE-121, which indicates a Stack-based Buffer Overflow.
- A fix is available in KeyShot version 2024.3.
