### Root cause of vulnerability
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the 'mightyforms' shortcode of the Contact Form, Survey & Form Builder â€“ MightyForms WordPress plugin.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
The primary weakness is Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to improper neutralization of input during web page generation.

### Impact of exploitation
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will then execute whenever a user accesses the injected page, potentially leading to malicious actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting users, or other unauthorized behavior.

### Attack vectors
The attack vector is through the plugin's 'mightyforms' shortcode. An attacker can inject malicious code through user-supplied attributes when using the shortcode on a page.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This level of access allows the attacker to create or edit pages and posts where they can insert the malicious shortcode.
