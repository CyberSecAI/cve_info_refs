### Description

The Contact Form, Survey & Form Builder – MightyForms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'mightyforms' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

I started using this plugin a few days ago. The plugin has been quite reliable for me, as it has helped me save off some valuable time by using their builder. Overall I’m pretty happy with the plugin and would be using it for my future websites.

I Love how easy it is to not only get started making Online Forms but also how easy it is to manage and expand those forms for anyone. The Form Builder is also amazing and unlike most others, allowing even a novice to make an interactive form. Drag and Drop for a generator that is user-friendly and smooth.

I was initially hesitant to try because there were no reviews – SO HAPPY I TRIED IT! And delighted to write the first review. Here’s what I loved: ~ Their chat support was fantastic to ask any questions I had, while I was creating my first form ~ I chose to integrate with Google Sheets and it automatically created a new folder and sheet upon my first test submission. ~ It’s very intuitive to use and TONS of customization options ~ It’s free! Honestly, it’s the easiest and most robust app I’ve used in a long time. They’ve thought of everything.
