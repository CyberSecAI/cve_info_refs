### [Difficult for a casual user](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/difficult-for-a-casual-user/)

[Denis Yanchevskiy](https://profiles.wordpress.org/denisco/ "Posts by Denis Yanchevskiy")

The plugin works great, but the average user will be difficult to deal with Font Awesome classes and CSS colors.
It would be nice to add a selection of icons as in plugin https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-font-awesome/ and color selection as in plugin https://wordpress.org/plugins/dco-shortcodes-menu/.
P.S. If you will properly prepare plugin for localization, I can help with translation to Russian language :).

### Description

The Perfect Font Awesome Integration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'pfai' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
