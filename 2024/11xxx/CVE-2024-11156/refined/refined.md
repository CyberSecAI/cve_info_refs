Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2024-11156:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An "out-of-bounds write" vulnerability exists in the affected Arena software. This means the software allows a write operation to occur beyond the intended boundaries of allocated memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787): The software fails to properly validate the size or boundary of the write operation, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A threat actor can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- **Control of the Application**: Successful exploitation could provide an attacker with complete control of the application.
- **Data Corruption**: The ability to write arbitrary data into memory can corrupt data structures leading to system instability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious DOE File:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious DOE (likely a file format used by the Arena software) file. This file is designed to trigger the out-of-bounds write during processing by the software.
- **User Interaction:** A legitimate user must execute the malicious DOE file, which is a necessary step to exploit the vulnerability. The user must open the malicious file within the vulnerable software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft Malicious DOE File:** An attacker must be able to create a specially crafted DOE file that exploits the out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- **Social Engineering or Similar:** The attacker must trick the user into opening the malicious DOE file within the Arena software, typically by convincing the user to open a file that they believe is safe, but actually contains the malicious payload.
