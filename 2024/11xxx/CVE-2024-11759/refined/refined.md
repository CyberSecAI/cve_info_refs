Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11759

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the Bukza plugin's 'bukza' shortcode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-provided attributes, allowing attackers to inject malicious web scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- These injected scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the compromised page.
- This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the 'bukza' shortcode.
- An attacker can insert malicious code via shortcode attributes.
- This malicious shortcode is then stored in the WordPress database, making the XSS attack persistent (stored).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Contributor or Higher:** The attacker needs at least contributor-level access to a WordPress site. This level of access allows users to create and edit posts and pages, where they can insert shortcodes.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability exists in all versions of the Bukza plugin up to and including 2.0.0.
- The vulnerable code within the `public/class-bukza-public.php` file did not properly sanitize the shortcode attributes `async`, `tag`, `user` and `timetable`.
- The fix involves sanitizing these attributes using `sanitize_text_field`, `sanitize_key`, and `absint` before rendering the shortcode output.
- The fix also involves using `esc_attr` when outputting the sanitized values in HTML attributes.
- The fix version for this vulnerability is 2.0.1.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided changeset shows the specific code modifications in `bukza.php`, `includes/class-bukza.php`, `public/class-bukza-public.php`, and `readme.txt`.
-  The `public/class-bukza-public.php` file is where the shortcode is processed, and the vulnerability is fixed by sanitizing and escaping the input.
