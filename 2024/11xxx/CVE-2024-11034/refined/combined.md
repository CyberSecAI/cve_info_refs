### Description

The The Request a Quote for WooCommerce and Elementor – Get a Quote Button – Product Enquiry Form Popup – Product Quotation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution via fire\_contact\_form AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 1.4. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do\_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.

This is without any doubt the best plugin of its category. It offers the same important features of other “Request a quote” plugins but, contrary to the others, this is super cheap. Moreover it has the function of showing the request quote form on a popup window that no other plugin of this type offers.
I’m currently using it on my online store where I display the products with woocommerce product table and none of the plugins of this kind that I tried were compatible, expect for this one.
The customer service is also fantastic. Imran has provided me with the best technical support ever. He installed and set up the plugin for me.
It’s great, cheap, reliable and saved my company a lot of money and time.
