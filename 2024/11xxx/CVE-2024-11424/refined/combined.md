### [CSS can cause conflict with other plugins](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/css-can-cause-conflict-with-other-plugins/)

slickmap.css contains the following:
a:link:before,
a:visited:before {
display: block;
text-transform: uppercase;
font-size: 10px;
margin-bottom: 5px;
word-wrap: break-word;
}
This is not confined to Slick Sitemap and has affected output from the My Calendar plugin. The correct css is there as well so just delete or comment out the above.

This is the best vistal sitemap plugin which I have discovered. But it is too old, it is incompatible with some WP functions like wp\_register\_style and wp\_enqueue\_style which may cause some conflicts and problems‚Ä¶ I hope will be continued, the concept is very good!

This plugin was updated quite recently before this review, but according to the forum no support issues have been resolved for several years. Although the plugin seems to work well so far, There are errors in the css (easily fixable) which may affect other parts of your site because the styles are not confined to the sitemap. Finally,it looks great on desktop, but I am not sure yet if it is very responsive for smaller screens.
Having said all that, I am going to persist with it because it is potentially a lot more user friendly than the normal ‚Äúbullet list‚Äù sitemap, and I am hoping those minor issues will be resolved soon üôÇ

### Description

The Slick Sitemap plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'slick-sitemap' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
