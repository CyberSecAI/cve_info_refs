- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the handling of model files, leading to deserialization of untrusted data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: The target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious model file, and the user must interact with it (e.g., by visiting a malicious page or opening the file).
