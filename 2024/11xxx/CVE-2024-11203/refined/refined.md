```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization and output escaping of the 'provider_name' parameter within the EmbedPress plugin. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the plugin settings.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An authenticated attacker with Contributor-level access or higher can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages that will be executed whenever a user accesses the injected page.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the 'provider_name' parameter, likely via a crafted URL or input within a plugin feature that utilizes the `get_provider_name` method.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with Contributor-level access or higher to inject the malicious code."
