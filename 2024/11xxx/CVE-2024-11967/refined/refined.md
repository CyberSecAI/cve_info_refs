Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11967 (based on the provided github issue)

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation of the 'email' parameter in the `/admin/reset-password.php` file. The application directly uses the user-supplied 'email' parameter in SQL queries without sanitizing or validating it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Malicious SQL code can be injected through the 'email' parameter, which is then executed by the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
*   **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Confidential data stored in the database can be exposed.
*   **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Comprehensive System Control:** In severe cases, attackers can achieve control over the entire system.
*  **Service Disruption:** The vulnerability could lead to a denial of service by modifying critical database entries or causing the system to malfunction.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is via an HTTP POST request to the `/admin/reset-password.php` file, specifically targeting the 'email' parameter in the request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No prior login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the 'email' parameter in the `/admin/reset-password.php` file is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Technical Details**
*   The vulnerability exists in the `/admin/reset-password.php` file of the "Complaint Management system" version 1.0.
*   The application uses the 'email' parameter unsanitized in SQL queries.
*   The provided proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrates boolean-based blind SQL injection and time-based blind SQL injection.
*   SQLmap tool is used to demonstrate the exploitation.

**Mitigation**
*   The content suggests the following remediation measures:
    1.  **Use prepared statements and parameter binding:**  To separate SQL code from user-provided input data.
    2.  **Input validation and filtering:** To ensure user inputs conform to expected formats.
    3.  **Minimize database user permissions:** To limit potential damage in case of exploitation.
    4.  **Regular security audits:** To proactively identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
