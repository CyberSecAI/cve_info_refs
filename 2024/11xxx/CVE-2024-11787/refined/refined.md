- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data when parsing V10 files, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious V10 file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to either host a malicious page or provide a malicious file which the user interacts with. User interaction is required.
