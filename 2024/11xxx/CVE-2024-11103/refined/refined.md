Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11103

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the Contest Gallery plugin's failure to properly validate a user's identity before allowing password updates. Specifically, the plugin does not verify the user's identity during the password reset process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Password Reset Mechanism:** The plugin uses a weak password reset process where it is possible to change any user's password without authentication.
*   **Lack of User Identity Validation:**  The plugin does not properly validate the user's identity before allowing a password reset.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can change passwords of any user, including administrators.
*   **Account Takeover:** By changing administrator passwords, attackers can gain complete control of the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** Attackers do not need to be logged in to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No Special Access Required:** Attackers can be unauthenticated users.
*   **Network Access:** Attackers need to be able to send requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability is located in the `users-login-check-ajax-lost-password.php` file of the plugin. The fix, as seen in the provided diff, involves generating a more secure password reset key using `wp_generate_password(32,false)` instead of a custom hash function and sanitizing the referer URL (`wp_get_referer()`) instead of using the request parameter `cgLostPasswordSiteUrl`.

The affected versions are <= 24.0.7, and the vulnerability is patched in version 24.0.8.
