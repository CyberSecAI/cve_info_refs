  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data when parsing ECW files, prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap-based buffer overflow",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious ECW file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious ECW file or induce the target to visit a malicious page that triggers the vulnerability."
