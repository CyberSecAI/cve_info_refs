## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Goodlayers Core < 2.0.10 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

1. As a contributor user, add a new post
2. Add the Goodlayers Accordion Element (others are also affected)
3. Edit the Accordion
4. Change the title to `"><script>alert(/heading-text/)</script>`
5. Click "Save Options"
6. Save the post as a draft
7. Preview and see the XSS alert. It will also display for admins reviewing the post.
