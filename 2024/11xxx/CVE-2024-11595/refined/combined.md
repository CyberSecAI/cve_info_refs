## wnpa-sec-2024-14 Â· FiveCo RAP dissector infinite loop

## Summary

**Name:** FiveCo RAP dissector infinite loop

**Docid:** wnpa-sec-2024-14

**Date:** November 20, 2024

**Affected versions:** 4.4.0 to 4.4.1, 4.2.0 to 4.2.8

**Fixed versions:** 4.4.2, 4.2.9

**References:**

[Wireshark issue 20176](https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/20176).

[CVE-2024-11595](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-11595).

## Details

### Description

The FiveCo RAP dissector could go into an infinite loop.

## Impact

Discovered
in our internal testing environment.
We are unaware of any exploits for this issue.
It may be possible to make Wireshark
consume excessive CPU resources
by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or
by convincing
someone to read a malformed packet trace file.

## Resolution

Upgrade to Wireshark 4.4.2, 4.2.9 or later.
