- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing ARW files. This leads to a write past the end of an allocated object.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious ARW file, which the user must open with IrfanView, or by enticing the user to visit a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious ARW file to the user or lure them to visit a malicious web page. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
