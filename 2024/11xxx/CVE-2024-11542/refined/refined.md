- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing DXF files, leading to a memory corruption condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a malicious DXF file or visiting a malicious web page that triggers the processing of a malicious DXF file. User interaction is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a crafted malicious DXF file and induce a user to open the malicious file or visit a webpage that triggers the processing of the malicious DXF file.
