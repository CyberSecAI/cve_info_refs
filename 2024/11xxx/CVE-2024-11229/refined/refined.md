### Summary:
The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the '코드엠샵 소셜톡' WordPress plugin, specifically in versions up to and including 1.1.18. The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes in the `add_plus_friends` and `add_plus_talk` shortcodes. This allows authenticated users with contributor-level access or higher to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.

**Root Cause:**

- Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when handling user-supplied attributes in the `add_plus_friends` and `add_plus_talk` shortcodes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied shortcode attributes, allowing malicious JavaScript code to be stored in the database and executed when a page containing the vulnerable shortcode is accessed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Arbitrary Script Execution: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the context of a user's browser when they view a page containing the injected shortcode, allowing an attacker to perform a variety of actions including session hijacking, cookie stealing, defacing web pages, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Exploiting shortcodes: By using the `add_plus_friends` or `add_plus_talk` shortcodes with malicious attributes (e.g., size, color, label) an attacker injects malicious scripts into the database.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Authenticated User: The attacker must have an account with at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site to create or edit posts/pages containing shortcodes.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in versions of the plugin up to and including 1.1.18
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.0.
- The Wordfence team discovered and reported this vulnerability.
- The vulnerable code is in the `includes/class-msntt-plus-friends.php` file.
- The fix implemented output escaping using `esc_attr_e()` function.
