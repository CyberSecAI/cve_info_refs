Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `finance_calculator` shortcode in the Financial Calculator WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-provided input within the shortcode attributes. This allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution in the victim's browser:  An attacker can inject malicious scripts into pages. These scripts will execute when a user views the page, allowing the attacker to perform actions within the user's session and potentially compromise their account or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The `finance_calculator` shortcode is the attack vector. Attackers can inject malicious code through shortcode attributes like `rate` or `price`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated attacker: The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site to create or edit posts/pages and insert the malicious shortcode.
- No specific user interaction is needed to trigger the vulnerability; it is triggered simply by a user viewing a page with the injected code.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in all versions of the plugin up to and including 2.2.1.
- There is no known patch available. The recommendation is to uninstall the plugin or apply mitigations.
