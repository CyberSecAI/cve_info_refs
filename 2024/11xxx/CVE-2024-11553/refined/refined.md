{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of DXF files, which can lead to a memory corruption condition.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Memory corruption due to insufficient input validation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when parsing a malicious DXF file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted DXF file, and the user must open it using the vulnerable software (IrfanView). User interaction is required."
