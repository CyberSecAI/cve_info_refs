Vendor of Product: Biotime
Version: 9.0.1
Description:
There is a vulnerability that allows unauthorized access to sensitive images without proper security permissions. This issue arises when a site administrator adds a user or an employee captures their picture. Consequently, an attacker can view all images by guessing the image URLs, effectively circumventing security measures.
Vulnerability Details:
The vulnerability can be exploited by performing a brute force attack on the image URLs. For example, by accessing the following URL pattern:
bash
Copy code
http://time.xmzkteco.com:8097/auth\_files/photo/\*
An attacker can brute-force the image names, trying variations such as name.jpg with numbers from 0 to 1000 or more, leading to access to images like:
bash
Copy code
http://time.xmzkteco.com:8097/auth\_files/photo/109.jpg
This allows an attacker to retrieve all images stored on the server.
Proof of Concept (PoC):
Using the URL pattern mentioned above, an attacker can sequentially access image files without authentication.
