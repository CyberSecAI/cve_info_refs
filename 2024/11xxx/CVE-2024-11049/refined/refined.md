- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper access controls on image URLs. Specifically, images of users and employees are stored in a publicly accessible directory (`auth_files/photo/`) and can be accessed by guessing their names.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of authentication or authorization for accessing image files, predictable URL structure for image files, insecure direct object reference.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to all images stored on the server, potentially exposing sensitive personal information of users and employees.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by directly accessing image URLs through HTTP requests. The attacker can use a brute-force approach to try various numeric and alphanumeric combinations until they find valid image URLs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit this vulnerability. They only need the knowledge of the URL pattern for image storage and the ability to make HTTP requests. They need to be able to guess or brute-force image file names.
