- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the parsing of DWG files due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability where a write operation occurs beyond the allocated memory.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by tricking a user into opening a malicious DWG file or visiting a malicious page that triggers the parsing of the malicious DWG data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious DWG file or convince the user to interact with malicious content that will trigger the parsing of such file. User interaction is required (opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious page).
