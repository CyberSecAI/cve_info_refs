Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11710

**Vulnerable Software:** WP Job Portal WordPress plugin

**Affected Versions:** <= 2.2.2

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The plugin is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to insufficient escaping of user-supplied parameters ('fieldfor', 'visibleParent', and 'id') and lack of proper preparation in the SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:**  The plugin directly incorporates user-provided input into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries. This could lead to the extraction of sensitive information from the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered through the 'fieldfor', 'visibleParent' and 'id' parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with at least Administrator-level access.
*   **Access:**  The attacker must have the ability to send requests that utilize the vulnerable parameters.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.3 of the plugin.
*   The provided code diff highlights the changes made to address the vulnerability, including checks for numeric inputs and escaping. Specifically, the changes include:
    *   `if(!is_numeric($section)){ return false; }` is added to check for numeric input of the `$section` variable in the `getResumeCustomSectionFields` function.
    *   `if (!is_numeric($data['fieldfor'])) { return false; }` is added to check if the `fieldfor` input is numeric.
    *   `if(is_numeric($data['visibleParent'])){...}` is added to ensure `$data['visibleParent']` input is numeric before being used in an SQL query.
    *   `if(is_numeric($visibleParent)){...}` is added to ensure `$visibleParent` input is numeric before being used in an SQL query.
    *   `if(!is_numeric($field)){ return false; }` is added to check if the `$field` input is numeric.
    *   `if( is_numeric($result->section) && $result->section > 8){...}` is added to validate the `$result->section` input is numeric before executing a query.
    *   `if (is_numeric($id) == false) return false;` and `if (is_numeric($fieldfor) == false) return false;` are added to check for numeric inputs for `$id` and `$fieldfor` respectively.
    *   `if(isset($visibleparams['visibleParent']) && is_numeric($visibleparams['visibleParent'])){...}` is added to validate that the  `$visibleparams['visibleParent']` is numeric.
    *   `if(!is_numeric($fieldfor)){ return false; }` is added before several queries to validate the numeric input of the `$fieldfor` variable.
    *   `if(isset($cid) && $cid !='' && is_numeric($cid)){...}` is added to validate that the `$cid` input is numeric.
    *   `if(isset($section) && $section !='' && is_numeric($section)){...}` is added to validate that the `$section` input is numeric.
    *  The `~~` operator used for type coercion has been removed and `esc_sql` has been added in many places for sanitization.
