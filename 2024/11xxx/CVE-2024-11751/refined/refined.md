Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11751

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `tcbd-popover-image` shortcode of the TCBD Popover WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user input when handling the 'title', 'place', and 'text' attributes within the shortcode. This allows malicious code to be stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages, which are then executed whenever a user accesses those pages. This can lead to:
    - Malicious redirects
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement of the website
    - Other malicious activities within the user's browser session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's shortcode attributes, specifically:
    - `tcbd-popover-image` shortcode's 'title', 'place', and 'text' attributes, which are not sanitized.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Contributor+ Access:** Attackers need to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This level of access allows them to create and edit posts and pages where they can insert the malicious shortcode.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions up to and including 1.2 of the TCBD Popover plugin.
- The shortcodes `tcbd-popover`, `tcbd-popover-link`, and `tcbd-popover-image-link` are also mentioned but the specific vulnerability details highlight that only `tcbd-popover-image` shortcode was vulnerable, however, they may be vulnerable as well.
- The Wordfence article indicates no patch is available and advises to mitigate the risk which may include uninstalling the plugin.
