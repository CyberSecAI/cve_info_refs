{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during Zstandard decompression, which can result in an integer underflow before writing to memory.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer underflow.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on affected installations of 7-Zip in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "Interaction with the 7-Zip library is required to exploit this vulnerability but attack vectors may vary depending on the implementation.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must be able to provide crafted input to trigger the vulnerable Zstandard decompression functionality in 7-Zip. The specific method to achieve this may vary depending on how 7-Zip is used (e.g., opening a crafted archive file)."
