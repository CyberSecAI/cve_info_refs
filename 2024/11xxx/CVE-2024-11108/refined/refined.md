- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them on a page/post.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when a user views a page/post containing the crafted shortcode. This can lead to various malicious activities like session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code via a crafted shortcode attribute, specifically the `id` attribute of the `[serious-slider]` shortcode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least a contributor role in WordPress. They can create or edit posts/pages and embed the malicious shortcode. They also need to know a valid slider ID, which can be obtained by viewing existing pages with sliders. The attacker also needs to convince a user to move the mouse over the slider.
