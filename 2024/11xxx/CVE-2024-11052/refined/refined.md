Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'calculations' parameter within the Ninja Forms plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when handling the calculations parameter. This allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code that gets stored in the database and executed in the browsers of users who view the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser session when they view the page containing the injected code.
*   **Session Hijacking:** This could enable the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user, such as stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, modifying the page content, or carrying out other harmful activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Calculations Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered when a crafted payload is inserted into the 'calculations' parameter, which is then stored and rendered on a page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to be logged in to exploit the vulnerability, highlighting the severity.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** All versions of the Ninja Forms plugin up to and including 3.8.19 are affected.
*   **Patched Version:** The vulnerability is resolved in version 3.8.20.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.2, indicating a high severity.
* The vulnerable code is located in `ninja-forms/tags/3.8.18/includes/Admin/Metaboxes/Calculations.php`
Specifically line 26 `Ninja_Forms::template( 'admin-metaboxes-calcs.html.php', $data[ 'calculations' ] );` where the unsanitized calculations data is used.
