### [Premiun Upgrade Flawed](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/premiun-upgrade-flawed/)

[jeannegauthier](https://profiles.wordpress.org/jeannegauthier/ "Posts by jeannegauthier")
August 19, 2023

The free version of the Page Restriction plugin worked well. I decided to purchase the premium upgrade ($149) so that I could restrict access to custom posts, as described in their advertisement for the plugin upgrade. The installation process of the premium version failed (twice) so I contacted the company for a refund. Instead of a refund, they scheduled an online “help” session. The installation process during the help session failed as well, so I added the support staff person to my website administrator list so that they could install it directly. When the support staffer was finished, I had a version of the plugin that had fewer features than the free version. I was told that the feature that I wanted (restricting access to custom posts) was only available in the “enterprise” version of the plugin (for more $). Save yourself some time (and $149) and avoid the ‘Premium’ version of this plugin.

This plugin is incredibly over-complicated for what it does.Also it ads a HUGE spammy widget on every page/post editor page that tells you to upgrade to pro to unlock the features on the widget. It’s the tallest admin widget I’ve ever seen and the features that are locked are all the plugin needs to be. It’s a minimum subscription of $149 for a limited version of the “pro” version, which is insane for a simple task.

### Description

The Page Restriction WordPress (WP) – Protect WP Pages/Post plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.6 via the WordPress core search feature. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data from posts that have been restricted to higher-level roles such as administrator.
