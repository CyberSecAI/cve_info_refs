Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11450

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the 'onlyoffice' shortcode of the ONLYOFFICE Docs WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-controlled input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious web scripts. These scripts are stored in the database and executed when a user accesses a page containing the injected code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser.
- **Potential for Malicious Actions:**  This could lead to various malicious actions, including:
    - Redirecting users to phishing sites.
    - Stealing session cookies or other sensitive information.
    - Modifying website content.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the plugin's `onlyoffice` shortcode.
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts by manipulating shortcode attributes, such as `align`, `width`, `height`, `inNewTab`, `fileName`, and `openButtonText`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** Attackers need to be authenticated users with at least contributor-level access to WordPress. This allows them to create or edit content and inject the malicious shortcode.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the ONLYOFFICE Docs plugin up to and including 2.0.0.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.2.0 by implementing input sanitization using `sanitize_text_field()` and output escaping using `esc_attr()`.
- The fix was applied to the `render_embedded`, `render_link`, and `render_block` functions in the `class-onlyoffice-plugin-frontend-controller.php` file.
- The plugin's shortcode attributes like `align`, `width`, `height`, `inNewTab`, `fileName`, and `openButtonText` were not properly sanitized before outputting into HTML code.
- The `wp_json_encode` function was used with `htmlspecialchars` to properly sanitize the data for the `data-config` attribute of the HTML element.
