Based on the provided content, here's the analysis for CVE-2024-11488:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the insufficient input validation and sanitization of the `ks` parameter within the `/app/admin/view/web_user.html` file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS, where the attacker-supplied script is reflected back to the user's browser, which then executes it. This is due to improper handling of user-supplied input.
- **Insufficient Input Validation/Sanitization:** The application fails to properly validate and sanitize the `ks` parameter before including it in the HTML output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Integrity Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to modification of the webpage.
- **Cookie Theft:**  An attacker can potentially steal cookies if a logged-in administrator accesses the malicious URL. This can lead to session hijacking and further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is initiated remotely via a crafted URL, allowing for network-based exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted URL to a user.
- **Low Privilege:** The attacker does not need high privileges on the system.
- **No User Interaction:** The attack does not require specific user interaction, other than the user visiting the malicious link.
-  **Public Exploit**: The exploit has been publicly disclosed.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in 115cms version up to 20240807.
- The vendor was notified but did not respond.
-  The issue was disclosed in a public issue on Github: `Hebing123/cve#70`

**CVSS Metrics:**
- **CVSS v4 Score:** 5.3
- **Attack Vector (AV):** Network
- **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low
- **Privileges Required (PR):** Low
- **User Interaction (UI):** None
- **Confidentiality Impact (VC):** None
- **Integrity Impact (VI):** Low
- **Availability Impact (VA):** None
