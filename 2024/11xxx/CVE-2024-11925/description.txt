The JobSearch WP Job Board plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.7. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a users identity when verifying an email address through the user_account_activation function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any user, including site administrators if the users email is known.
