### Description

The JobSearch WP Job Board plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.7. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a users identity when verifying an email address through the user\_account\_activation function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any user, including site administrators if the users email is known.
