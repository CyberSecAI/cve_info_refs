- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the parsing of JPM files within IrfanView, specifically due to a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it into a heap-based buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can exploit this by enticing the victim to open a specially crafted malicious JPM file or by visiting a malicious web page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a malicious JPM file and then trick the user into opening it. User interaction is required.
