- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing DXF files, leading to a memory corruption condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory corruption vulnerability due to insufficient input validation when parsing DXF files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by opening a malicious DXF file or by visiting a malicious webpage, which would trigger the parsing of the malicious DXF file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious DXF file to the user. User interaction is required, as the target must either open the malicious file or visit a malicious page.
