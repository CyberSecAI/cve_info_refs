Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `page` parameter within the "PDF Builder for WooCommerce" WordPress plugin. This allows for the injection of malicious web scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The plugin does not properly sanitize user-controlled input (specifically, the `page` parameter) before using it in the output, enabling an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. If a user clicks a crafted link, the malicious script will execute within the user's browser session. This can potentially lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript in the `page` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking a malicious link. This often involves social engineering tactics such as phishing.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Software:** WordPress plugin "PDF Builder for WooCommerce. Create invoices,packing slips and more".
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions up to and including 1.2.136.
*   **Patched Version:** 1.2.137 addresses the vulnerability.
*   **CVSS Score:** 6.1 (Medium).
*   The vulnerable code was located within `pages/custom_field_list.php`. The patch replaces the vulnerable `$_REQUEST['page']` with the hardcoded value `'invoice-builder-custom-fields'` to prevent the injection.
*   The issue was fixed in version 1.2.137.
