### Relevant Content:

Based on the provided information, the content relates to **CVE-2024-11230**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'size' parameter within the Page Title widget of the Elementor Header & Footer Builder plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- Improper neutralization of input during web page generation

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page, leading to potential malicious actions like data theft, session hijacking, or redirecting users to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through the 'size' parameter within the Page Title widget.
- An attacker injects malicious code into the size parameter, which is then stored in the database.
- When a user views the page, the stored script is executed in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated with Contributor-level access or higher.
- They must be able to edit content using the Elementor Header & Footer Builder plugin.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Elementor Header & Footer Builder plugin up to and including 1.6.46.
- The fix for this vulnerability was released in version 1.6.47, which includes sanitization of the 'size' parameter in the `class-page-title.php` file.
- The vulnerable code is located in the `content_template()` function of the `class-page-title.php` file, specifically in the rendering of the `elementor-size-` class.
- The fix involves sanitizing the size attribute using `elementor.helpers.sanitize(sanitizedSize)` before rendering it in the HTML.
- The plugin maintainers were notified of the vulnerability by Wordfence and addressed the issue in version 1.6.47.
