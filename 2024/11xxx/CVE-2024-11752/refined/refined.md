Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-11752:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the 'eveeno' shortcode of the Eveeno WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user input when handling attributes within the `eveeno` shortcode. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is then stored in the WordPress database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** When a user visits a page containing the injected malicious script, that script will execute within their browser. This can lead to various impacts, including:
    *   **Data Theft:** Stealing cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
    *   **Account Hijacking:** Performing actions on behalf of the user without their consent.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   **Website Defacement:** Altering the appearance or content of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack is performed through the 'eveeno' shortcode.
*   An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code as an attribute of the shortcode.
*   This malicious code is stored in the WordPress database
*   The injected code is executed in the user's browser when the affected page is accessed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "contributor-level" access to the WordPress site. This means they need the ability to create or modify content (posts or pages).
*   **Shortcode Insertion:** The attacker must be able to insert the vulnerable shortcode on a page, and modify its attributes.
*   **No User Interaction:** The attack is successful when another user views the page containing the malicious shortcode without any action required from the victim user.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the Eveeno plugin up to and including 1.7.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.8 of the plugin.
*   The fix involved implementing proper escaping of the attributes used in the iframe shortcode.
*   The vulnerable code was in `eveeno.php` where iframe attributes were not properly sanitized using WordPress escaping functions.

The provided content offers more detail than the typical CVE description, specifically:

*   **Specific Plugin and Version:** The affected plugin is identified as "Eveeno" and versions up to 1.7 are vulnerable.
*   **Exploitation Details:** It specifies the vulnerability is located in the 'eveeno' shortcode and how attributes are used, leading to the XSS.
*   **Fix Information:** It provides the fixed version (1.8) and mentions that proper escaping of HTML attributes was implemented.
*   **Vulnerable Code:** The specific code changes in `eveeno.php` in version 1.8 are included, that fixes the issue with the help of `esc_attr()` and `esc_html__()` functions.
