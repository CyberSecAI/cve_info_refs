Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11884

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `wp-photo-slider` shortcode. Specifically, the `direction` attribute is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied data, allowing the injection of arbitrary web scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page. When a user accesses this page, the injected script will execute in their browser.
- **Website Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to account hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode Injection:** Attackers exploit the `wp-photo-slider` shortcode by including malicious JavaScript code in the `direction` attribute. For example, `[wp-photo-slider type="gallery1" direction="<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>"]`.
- **Stored XSS:** The injected malicious script is stored in the database and executed whenever a page containing the vulnerable shortcode is accessed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Contributor or Higher:**  Attackers need to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site to be able to inject the malicious shortcode into posts or pages.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Plugin:** Wp photo text slider 50
- **Affected Versions:** All versions up to and including 8.1.
- **Vulnerable Code Location:** `wp-photo-text-slider-50.php#L250`
