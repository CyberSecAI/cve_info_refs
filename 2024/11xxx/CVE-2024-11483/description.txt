A vulnerability was found in the Ansible Automation Platform (AAP). This flaw allows attackers to escalate privileges by improperly leveraging read-scoped OAuth2 tokens to gain write access. This issue affects API endpoints that rely on ansible_base.oauth2_provider for OAuth2 authentication. While the impact is limited to actions within the userâ€™s assigned permissions, it undermines scoped access controls, potentially allowing unintended modifications in the application and consuming services.
