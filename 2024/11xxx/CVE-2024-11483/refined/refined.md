{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper scope handling in OAuth2 tokens within the automation-gateway component.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability allows users to escalate their privileges from read to write, bypassing OAuth2 scope restrictions. This means that a user with a read-only token could potentially gain write access to resources, although within the user's existing permissions.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers could escalate privileges by improperly leveraging read-scoped OAuth2 tokens to gain write access, undermining scoped access controls. This could lead to unintended modifications within the application and consuming services.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves exploiting the improper handling of OAuth2 scopes within the automation-gateway component.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need to have a valid OAuth2 token with read permissions. The attacker can then manipulate requests to gain write access."
