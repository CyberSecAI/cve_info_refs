**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect execution-assigned permissions. A local low-level user with credentials to the running OAS services can create and execute a report with an rdlx file. Code within this rdlx file executes with SYSTEM privileges.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect Execution-Assigned Permissions (CWE-279)
- Privilege escalation

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute code with SYSTEM level privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to have local access to the server machine and credentials to the running OAS services. They then must create and execute a malicious report containing an rdlx file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local access to the server machine.
- Credentials to the running OAS services.
- Ability to create and execute a report using an rdlx file.
