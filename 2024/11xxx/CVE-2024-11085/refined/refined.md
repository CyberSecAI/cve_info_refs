- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authorization check on several AJAX actions within the WP Log Viewer plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing capability checks, allowing unauthorized access to plugin functionalities.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access (or higher) can access logs, update plugin-related user settings, and general plugin settings. This leads to unauthorized viewing and modification of sensitive data and settings.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs via AJAX actions on the WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least Subscriber-level access.
