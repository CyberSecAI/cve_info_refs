I find the bulk input feature incredibly useful, and it‚Äôs a fantastic bonus to have features like ratings and equipment included in the free version of the recipe plugin.
However, one significant drawback is the lack of documentation for the shortcodes. It took me some time to navigate the support forum to understand how to use them effectively. Improving the accessibility of shortcode information would greatly enhance the user experience.

The plugin itself is easy to use and the author actually helps you with your issues.

It‚Äôs great at formatting recipes. The only problem is that there are no instructions I could find anywhere about which shortcodes to use for what or how.

Special thanks to all the contributors. This plugin is so well integrated into the WordPress platform and the Gutenberg Editor. I really like the simple design.
The fact that this plugin is open source makes it to my first choice. A feature, I would like to see in the future are Recipe Roundups.
Anyway, I love it üòç

Absolutely works like a charm and the amount of features and freedom you have with this plugin is second to none. I have tried many other plugins but this one is the best so far.
This one has literally everything a paid plugin would offer. You can add your own taxonomies and equipment, including affiliate links beside the ingredients and equipment entries.
I actually can‚Äôt believe that this is not a paid plugin. It is easy to use and simple.
Great support at the time of writing as the developer responded within a day with the answers to my questions.

I¬¥m still digging into the possibilities this plugin offers, but so far I do believe it is the best candidate for my new recipe project.

### Description

The RecipePress Reloaded plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Recipe Ingredients in all versions up to, and including, 2.12.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
