{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to broken access control on the ID parameter used in the patient's delete account feature.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR). The application does not properly validate if the user is authorized to perform the deletion on the provided ID.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can delete any patient's account permanently by manipulating the 'id' parameter.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is carried out by intercepting the request to delete a patient's account and modifying the ID parameter to target a different patient's account.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be logged in as a patient and have knowledge or be able to guess the ID of other patients. The attacker also needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests, typically using a tool like Burp Suite."
