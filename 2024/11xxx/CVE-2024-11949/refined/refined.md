- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, leading to deserialization of untrusted data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Deserialization of untrusted data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based, exploiting the Store Service which listens on TCP port 8018 by default.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Authentication is required.
