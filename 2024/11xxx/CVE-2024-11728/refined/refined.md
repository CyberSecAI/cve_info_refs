Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is insufficient sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input within the `visit_type[service_id]` parameter within the `tax_calculated_data` AJAX action in the KiviCare plugin.
*   The plugin does not adequately prepare the SQL query, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The lack of proper input sanitization allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive information from the database, as they can craft SQL queries to retrieve any data stored in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attack vector is through the vulnerable AJAX endpoint, which does not require authentication.
*   **Malicious Parameter Injection:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code through the `visit_type[service_id]` parameter of the `tax_calculated_data` AJAX action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated User:** No prior authentication or special user role is required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** Attackers must have network access to the WordPress site in order to send malicious requests to the vulnerable AJAX endpoint.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability was patched in version 3.6.5 of the KiviCare plugin. The fix involves sanitizing the service_id parameter by casting it to integer `(int)$id` which prevents SQL injection.
* The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.5 (High).
