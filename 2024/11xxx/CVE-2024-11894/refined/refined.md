Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `permalink` shortcode of The Permalinker WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided attributes within the `permalink` shortcode, allowing the injection of arbitrary web scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:**  Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of the victim's browser when a user accesses a page containing the crafted shortcode.
*   **Compromised User Accounts:** This could lead to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or other actions that compromise the security of users viewing the affected pages.
*   **Website Defacement/Malicious Redirection:** Attackers can modify content, redirect users, or perform other malicious activities through the injected scripts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Injection:**  The vulnerability is exploited through the `permalink` shortcode. Attackers can inject malicious scripts by including them within the attributes of this shortcode (e.g., `[permalink id=123 class="malicious-code"]`).
*   **Stored XSS:** The malicious code is stored in the WordPress database and is executed when the page containing the vulnerable shortcode is rendered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** Attackers need to have at least "contributor" level access to the WordPress site. This level allows them to create and edit posts/pages, which is necessary to insert the malicious shortcode.
*   **Knowledge of Shortcode Syntax:** The attacker must be familiar with the `permalink` shortcode and how to inject malicious attributes into it.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:**  The vulnerability affects all versions of The Permalinker plugin up to and including 1.8.1.
*   **Patch:** The vulnerability is patched in version 1.9.0
*   The vulnerable code is in the `permalinker_links` function, specifically the attributes handling, where they are not properly sanitized.
