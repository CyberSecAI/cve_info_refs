## Description

After installing the plugin, the button editor for the plugin will appear in the page editor of WordPress. Use it to add your Outdooractive content to your website.

For programmers: The plugin uses the shortcode oaembed. The only required parameter is url, all others are optional.

#### For example:

paste `[oaembed url = "http://www.outdooractive.com/en/serviced-hut/graubuenden/tschiervahuette/15280962/"]` into “text mode” of the editor and click Preview. Your embedded content will appear.

The following options are supported:

*Maximum width*

Specify a maximum pixel width for incorporating your content. The maximum width must not be less than 260 pixels.

Example: `[oaembed url = "http://www.outdooractive.com/en/serviced-hut/graubuenden/tschiervahuette/15280962/" maxwidth = "400"]`

#### Include content in the sidebar, footer, etc.

You can embed your content in sidebars and footers using WordPress widgets. For more information on WordPress widgets, visit: https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress\_Widgets

#### Tip: white label embedding with Pro+

With Pro+ you have even better opportunities to integrate tours and interesting points on your website. [Learn more about Pro+] (https://www.outdooractive.com/en/pro-business.html)

To use Pro+ Embedding, follow the instructions on the settings page of the plugin (*Settings* → *Outdooractive Embed*).

In the new Gutenberg Editor you can find a “Outdooractive Embed” block under the category “Embed”. It has the same options as mentioned above. Additionally it will show you a live preview in the editor.

#### Please note:

Only published Contents can be embeded

### [Broke my website](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/broke-my-website-57/)

[AnneTanne](https://profiles.wordpress.org/annetanne/ "Posts by AnneTanne")
November 9, 2020

It was impossible to let the plugin accept the by outdooractive generated code to have the plugin registered. (Kept saying I had to enter a valid code… The way I obtained the code was exactly as in the description.)
But to make matters worse, after having tried a few times, my site couldn’t establish its database connection, and I had to manually remove the plugin from the server.

Because of a link-failure and a JavaScript failure it slows down the buildup of a page. Hopefully developers will find the bug, already reported to the forum.
Plugin looks fine and does what it should! Will be rated with 5 stars if bugs were done 😉

### Description

The Outdooractive Embed plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'list2go' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
