The provided content relates to CVE-2024-11074.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `incadd.php` file of the "Tailoring Management System Project In PHP With Source Code".
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user input, specifically the `inccat` parameter, before using it in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly incorporates user-supplied data into SQL queries without proper sanitization.
- Lack of input validation: The application fails to validate and filter user-provided data, making it susceptible to injection attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized database access
- Sensitive data leakage
- Data tampering
- Comprehensive system control
- Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to the `incadd.php` file
- Maliciously crafted SQL injection payload in the `inccat` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send HTTP requests to the server.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter (`inccat`) and how to construct SQL injection payloads.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is classified as a time-based blind SQL injection.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection using a `SLEEP()` function.
- The attacker can use SQLMap to automate the exploitation process.
- The vulnerability is located in the 'inccat' parameter of the `incadd.php` file.
- The vulnerable software is "Tailoring Management System Project In PHP With Source Code" version 1.0.
- The vulnerable file is `incadd.php`.
- Suggested repair includes using prepared statements, input validation, minimizing database user permissions, and regular security audits.
