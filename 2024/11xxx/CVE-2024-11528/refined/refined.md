- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing DXF files, leading to a memory corruption condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: Opening a malicious DXF file or visiting a malicious page hosting such a file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a crafted DXF file or induce the user to open such a file. User interaction (opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious page) is required.
