**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data length when parsing WB1 files. Specifically, the program fails to check the length of the data before copying it to a stack-based buffer, resulting in a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient input validation.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process (i.e., the user running IrfanView).

**Attack vectors:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to open a specially crafted malicious WB1 file or by directing them to a malicious page designed to trigger the vulnerability. User interaction is required.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious WB1 file or a link to a malicious page to the victim. The victim must open the file or visit the page using IrfanView.
