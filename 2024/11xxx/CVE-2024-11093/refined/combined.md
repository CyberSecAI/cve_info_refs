### Description

The SG Helper plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in version 1.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file.
