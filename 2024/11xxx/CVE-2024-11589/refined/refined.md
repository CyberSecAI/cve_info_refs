Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11589

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Affected Product:** Tailoring Management System Project In PHP With Source Code v1.0

**Vulnerable File:** `expcatedit.php`

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization and validation of the `id` parameter in the `expcatedit.php` file. User-supplied input is directly used in SQL queries without any prior cleaning or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection. Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate and sanitize user input, specifically the `id` parameter before using it in database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
*   **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can extract sensitive data stored in the database.
*   **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database.
*   **System Control:** Attackers could potentially gain control over the system.
*   **Service Interruption:** Attackers can disrupt the service by manipulating the database or the application behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploitable through an HTTP GET request by manipulating the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques.

**Technical Details and Proof of Concept:**
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `id` parameter in `expcatedit.php`
*   **Exploitation Methods:** The report mentions both time-based blind SQL injection and UNION query injection are possible.
    *   **Time-Based Blind Payload:** `id=19' AND (SELECT 3151 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))pERu) AND 'kPeI'='kPeI`
    *   **UNION Query Payload:** `id=-8252' UNION ALL SELECT CONCAT(0x716b6a7a71,0x634d776562616565644f446a7679485445415a4a79767573576b44764547796f676a6357626c6a6c,0x716b6b7a71)-- -`
*   **SQLmap Usage:**  The report includes a command example using the sqlmap tool to demonstrate the exploit: `sqlmap -r 123 --batch --dbs`

**Suggested Repairs:**
1.  **Prepared Statements:** Use prepared statements and parameter binding to prevent SQL injection. This treats user input as data, not code.
2.  **Input Validation and Filtering:** Strictly validate and filter all user inputs to ensure that they conform to the expected format.
3.  **Least Privilege Principle:** Minimize database user permissions, avoiding the use of highly privileged accounts for routine operations.
4.  **Security Audits:** Regularly conduct security audits to identify and fix any vulnerabilities promptly.
