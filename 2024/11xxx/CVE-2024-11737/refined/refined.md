- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation when processing crafted Modbus packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input validation when the Modicon controllers process Modbus packets. This allows an attacker to send specifically crafted packets that can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to a denial of service (DoS), partial loss of integrity, and a loss of confidentiality of the controller, potentially disrupting operations.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted Modbus packets to the affected devices over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker does not require any authentication to exploit this vulnerability and can send malicious Modbus packets to the vulnerable devices over the network, thus the attacker could be located anywhere on the network that can reach the vulnerable device.
