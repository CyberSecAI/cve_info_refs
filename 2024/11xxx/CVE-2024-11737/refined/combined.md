Vulnerability Details

CVE ID: CVE-2024-11737

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 9.8 | Critical | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
CVSS v4.0 Base Score 9.3 | Critical | CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N

CWE-20: Improper Input Validation vulnerability exists that could lead to a denial of service and a loss of
confidentiality, integrity of the controller when an unauthenticated crafted Modbus packet is sent to the device.

The severity of vulnerabilities was calculated using the CVSS Base metrics for 4.0 (CVSS v4.0). CVSS v3.1
will be still evaluated until the adoption of CVSS v4.0 by the industry. The severity was calculated without
incorporating the Temporal and Environmental metrics. Schneider Electric recommends that customers score
the CVSS Environmental metrics, which are specific to end-user organizations, and consider factors such as
the presence of mitigations in that environment. Environmental metrics may refine the relative severity posed
by the vulnerabilities described in this document within a customer’s environment.

Mitigations

Affected Product & Version

Mitigations

Modicon Controllers M241 /
M251 / M258 / LMC058
All versions

Schneider Electric is establishing a remediation plan for all future versions
of Modicon M241/M251/M258/LMC058 that will include a fix for this
vulnerability. We will update this document when the remediation is
available. Until then, customers should immediately apply the following
mitigations to reduce the risk of exploit:

•  Use controllers and devices only in a protected environment to

minimize network exposure and ensure that they are not
accessible from public internet or untrusted networks.

•  Filter ports and IP through the embedded firewall.
•  Setup network segmentation and implement a firewall to block all

unauthorized access to port 502/TCP.

•  Disable all unused protocols (default configuration).
•  For more details refer to “Cybersecurity Guidelines for

EcoStruxure Machine Expert, Modicon and PacDrive Controllers
and Associated Equipment User Guide”:

General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.

•  Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from

•

the business network.
Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control and safety
systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.

•  Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the “Program” mode.
•  Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for that device.
•  Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB drives, etc.

before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.

•  Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the intended network to

connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.

•  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that they are not

accessible from the Internet.

Schneider Electric Security Notification

•  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).
Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version
available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.
