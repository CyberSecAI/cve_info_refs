- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from unfiltered user input being passed directly to a system command in the `diag_ping` functionality of the ENGENIUS router's web interface. Specifically, the value provided by the user for the `diag_ping` parameter is directly used as part of a command executed by the system.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability exists due to the lack of input sanitization or filtering.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system, potentially gaining complete control of the device. This includes access to system permissions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the ENGENIUS router, specifically the `/admin/network/diag_ping` endpoint. The attacker crafts a malicious request that includes shell commands within the `diag_ping` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have access to the router's web interface and be logged in with sufficient privileges to access the diagnostic ping functionality.
