### Description

The Responsive Videos plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'somryv' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

Works OK but:
Adds CSS in head of every page regardless of video being loaded.
No option to turn CSS off and manually add to stylesheet.
Adds a sub-menu for settings under Plugins. Plugin settings belong under settings menu!

I tried several of the bigger YT plugins before and all of them annoyed me more or less. This one finally did the job: Responsive embedded videos on mobile devices while keeping a maximum size on bigger screens. Simple and effective!
You can use all YT parameters like “&rel=0&showinfo=0&modestbranding=1” and even embedding YT playlists is easy by using “videoseries?list=URL”. Great!
2 suggestions:
Could you add a privacy option using the “youtube-nocookie”-URL?
The plugin settings should be placed under “settings”, not under “plugins”.

Finally one that works, after trying about 5 of the popular ones, this was the only one that actually made my video responsive using the Mayatheme and also allowed to play friendly within other column shortcodes. Thanks very much and keep up the good work 🙂
