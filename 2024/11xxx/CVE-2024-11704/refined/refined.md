Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-11704:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A double-free vulnerability exists in the `sec_pkcs7_decoder_start_decrypt()` function, specifically within an error handling path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Double-Free:** The same symmetric key could be freed twice under specific conditions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Potential memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of PKCS#7 decryption, specifically within an error handling scenario within the `sec_pkcs7_decoder_start_decrypt()` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to provide crafted input that triggers the specific error path in `sec_pkcs7_decoder_start_decrypt()` leading to a double free of the same symmetric key.
