Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization and output escaping of the `position` parameter within the `duck_parallax_shortcode` function in the Parallax Image WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied input for the `position` parameter used in the `dd-parallax` shortcode. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the parameter. This code is then stored in the database and executed whenever a user views a page containing the vulnerable shortcode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    *   **Session hijacking:** Stealing user cookies and session information.
    *   **Phishing:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or displaying fake login forms.
    *   **Website defacement:** Modifying website content.
    *   **Malware distribution:** Injecting scripts that download and execute malware on the user's machine.
    *   **Privilege escalation:** If an administrator views the injected content, the attacker could potentially elevate their privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Injection:** An attacker can insert the malicious JavaScript code through the `position` parameter of the `dd-parallax` shortcode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User (Contributor+):**  The attacker must have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This level of access allows users to create and edit posts/pages where they can insert the malicious shortcode.

**Technical Details**

* The vulnerable code snippet is located in `parallax-image/tags/1.9/assets/shortcode.php` (and earlier versions):
    ```php
    $output .= '<div class="parallax-window" data-z-index="' . esc_attr( $zindex ) . '" data-position-x="' . $atts['position'] . '" data-parallax="scroll" data-speed="' . esc_attr( $speed ) . '" data-image-src="' . esc_url( $image_url ) . '"';
    ```
    The `$atts['position']` variable, which is directly derived from user input, is inserted into the `data-position-x` attribute without proper sanitization.
*   The fix implemented in version 1.9.1 of the plugin involves sanitizing the `position` parameter using `esc_attr` and `sanitize_text_field`, and using `wp_unslash`:
    ```php
    $position = strtolower( sanitize_text_field( wp_unslash( $atts['position'] ) ) );
    $output .= '<div class="parallax-window" data-z-index="' . esc_attr( $zindex ) . '" data-position-x="' . esc_attr( $position ) . '" data-parallax="scroll" data-speed="' . esc_attr( $speed ) . '" data-image-src="' . esc_url( $image_url ) . '"';
    ```
    This prevents the injection of malicious code through the `position` parameter.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Peter Thaleikis and was publicly disclosed on November 18, 2024.
*   The patched version of the plugin is 1.9.1.
