## FAQ

### How do I display YouTube Shorts from a specific YouTube Channel?

To display YouTube shorts, simply set the channel ID and set the layout to Shorts showcase like this:

[sw-youtube channel=”UCAuUUnT6oDeKwE6v1NGQxug” layout=”showcase”]

### How do I display YouTube videos from a specific YouTube Channel?

[sw-youtube channel=”UCAuUUnT6oDeKwE6v1NGQxug”]

### How do I display YouTube videos from a specific YouTube Playlist?

[sw-youtube playlist=”UUAuUUnT6oDeKwE6v1NGQxug”]

### How do I display YouTube live streams from a list of YouTube Channels?

[sw-youtube livestream=”UCXuqSBlHAE6Xw-yeJA0Tunw,UCAuUUnT6oDeKwE6v1NGQxug”]

### How do I create a YouTube API key?

This plugin requires a YouTube API key in order to pull data from YouTube. An API key from YouTube comes with an API quota of 10,000 units per day. For most sites, this YouTube API key quota will be enough to display all the YouTube channel content you wish.

I was hesitant to download it as well, since it didn’t have many reviews, but I gave it a try, and WOW it works really great! Not only that, I wanted some customisation, and I got support on Sunday, and solved by Monday. A+ if you ask me!

There is a lot of functionnality in this plugin, in my opinion it is the best plugin to embed youtube shorts and youtube videos for free. Then after installing it, the support helped me until everything was fixed.
Must have, I recommend it !

### Description

The StreamWeasels YouTube Integration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'sw-youtube-embed' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
