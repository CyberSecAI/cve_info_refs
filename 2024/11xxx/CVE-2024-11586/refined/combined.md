# With Bluetooth headset connect, a malicious program can crash Pulseaudio on Ubuntu16.04

|  | [pulseaudio (Ubuntu)](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pulseaudio "Latest release: 1:17.0+dfsg1-1ubuntu1, uploaded to main on 2025-01-10 07:48:11.118701+00:00 by Alessandro Astone (aleasto), maintained by Ubuntu Developers (ubuntu-devel-discuss-lists)") | New | Undecided | Unassigned |  |

### Bug Description

On Ubuntu 16.04, a malicious app could abuse a Bluetooth module configuration for Ubuntu Touch to crash Pulseaudio:

```

pactl unload-module module-bluez5-discover

pactl load-module module-null-sink sink\_name=sink.fake.sco rate=8000 channels=1

pactl load-module module-null-source source\_name=source.fake.sco rate=8000 channels=1

pactl load-module module-bluez5-discover sco\_sink=sink.fake.sco sco\_source=source.fake.sco

# Now, connect a Bluetooth headset, then:

pactl list cards # Make note of Bluetooth card name.

pactl set card-profile bluez\_card.<address> headset\_head\_unit

pactl set-sink-volume sink.fake.sco 69

```

An app could repeatedly do this, preventing audio from working as long as a Bluetooth headset is still connected.

This is discovered while working on a similar patch on UBports' Ubuntu Touch 20.04. Admittedly, I was not able to actually test this on Ubuntu 16.04 + ESM proper yet, but a similar set of commands is tested to be able to crash Pulseaudio on Ubuntu Touch 20.04, which carry a forward-ported version of the SCO-over-PCM patch.

A patch which should fix this issue is attached. This is a problem in Ubuntu-specific SCO-over-PCM patch, and thus is not applicable in other distros.

Hi Ratchanan,

Thank you for disclosing this vulnerability to us.

Could you please give me access to <https://gitlab.com/ubports/development/core/packaging/pulseaudio/-/issues/5> ? I have the same username on gitlab: eslerm

I am unsure if this needs one or two CVEs without seeing that bug.

Seems like GitLab doesn't have the ability to invite a user to a single issue, except to add you to the GitLab project itself (which I'll have to discuss with the team). But the only difference between this issue and the issue on GitLab (I also wrote the GitLab issue, BTW) is that there's no need for the first 4 `pactl` reconfiguration commands since, on Ubuntu Touch, those configs are the default.

And now that I re-read my own words, let me clarify one thing: the issue on our side is also in the same SCO-over-PCM patch, just forward-ported to Pulseaudio 13.99.1 [1].

Today I get to test this on 16.04, and it turns out that we have a more troubling issue. PulseAudio would crash after I unload and re-load `module-bluez5-discover` with the following assertion:

```

[pulseaudio] bluez5-util.c: Assertion 'dbus\_connection\_register\_object\_path(pa\_dbus\_connection\_get(y->connection), A2DP\_SOURCE\_ENDPOINT, &vtable\_endpoint, y)' failed at modules/bluetooth/bluez5-util.c:1702, function endpoint\_init(). Aborting.

```

This apparently seem to be because PA tries to create a new `pa\_bluetooth\_discovery` while the old one is still in use by the previously-loaded `module-bluez5-device`. This doesn't work, as the old object have not unregistered itself as an `A2DP\_SOURCE\_ENDPOINT` handler.

This is still the case in PulseAudio 16.1 in Ubuntu 24.04, and now seems to be an upstream issue. I briefly looked through PulseAudio's code, and it seems like there's no way PulseAudio prevents an in-use module from being unloaded (short of preventing module load/unload for the whole process). So I'm not sure how to proceed here.

As for the original issue, as it's now not possible to hit in default configuration (due to another issue), I'm not sure if you would still classify this as a security issue.

Sorry for being late to this, the notification went into the back of my inbox without me noticing.

The actual patch is ~9 years old and I am not sure if I still get the entire context, given I haven't work on bluez and pulseaudio for a while.

Trying to revive my understanding of the code, what is done in the patch attached to #1 seems sensible as a fix but I haven't tested myself. The the original code has moved entirely into the else branch but the

if (u->profile == PA\_BLUETOOTH\_PROFILE\_HEADSET\_HEAD\_UNIT) {

         pa\_sink\_set\_set\_volume\_callback(u->sink, sink\_set\_volume\_cb);

         u->sink->n\_volume\_steps = 16;

     }

part is not.

The USE\_SCO\_OVER\_PCM macro is defined as

#define USE\_SCO\_OVER\_PCM(u) (u->profile == PA\_BLUETOOTH\_PROFILE\_HEADSET\_HEAD\_UNIT && (u->hsp.sco\_sink && u->hsp.sco\_source))

However the same code fragment we move into the else branch above is also present outside of the else branch in setup\_stream. The patch only seems to fix add\_sink

@Ratchanan is there a reason you haven't fixed the same code in setup\_stream? I may miss details here given my aged understanding of the code.

If you mean the similar code in add\_source(), then I've genuinely missed it. Indeed the `source\_set\_volume\_cb()` have a similar assumption of the source being its own and not an external one. I've amended the patch to include this, and adjusted the patch description. I can't find a similar code in `setup\_stream()`.

BTW, should I file another issue for the ability to crash PA by simply unloading then re-loading `module-bluez5-discover`?

@Mark wdyt? I am not maintaining either pulseaudio or bluez so hard for me to comment on.

Ok. That's the one in `add\_source()` and is now fixed in the 2nd version of the patch (comment #10).

Great, then that's good.

@Mark Code wise this looks OK to me, but I haven't run any tests to proof it is actually functional. There are also a few other questions from Ratchanan above I can't comment on.

This isn't strictly necessary on Launchpad if we remember to distinguish them. PA would likely appreciate a report.

Let me summarize and if others agree with my understanding, we can start assigning CVEs.

For the original issue: loading a malicious app can cause PA to crashed by setting volume through the SCO sink.

The second issue: PA can be crashed when the module-bluez5-discover is unloaded and reloaded.

So for CVEs, let's assign a CVE to the original issue. For the second, it's not clear if this is a non-security bug or vulnerability. What permissions are needed to unload and reload the module?

Correct. Caveat being that, pa-module-droid must be configured to operate in that way (default in Ubuntu Touch). Whether or not a malicious app can configure PA that way depends on whether it hits the second issue first.

> The second issue: PA can be crashed when the module-bluez5-discover is unloaded and reloaded.

When a Bluetooth headset is connected. If no headset is connected, module-bluez5-discover unloads cleanly.

> So for CVEs, let's assign a CVE to the original issue. For the second, it's not clear if this is a non-security bug or vulnerability. What permissions are needed to unload and reload the module?

My understanding is that Pulseaudio by default doesn't have any provision to block loading and unloading modules. The ability to block that comes from Ubuntu-specific patches (0407-access-Add-access-control-hooks.patch and a few others), which module-snap-policy makes use of. This is actually Flatpak's concerns when they have to let Flatpak applications access PulseAudio for audio playback.

BTW, now that we mention this, while module-snap-policy nowadays blocks module loading and unloading for Snaps, module-trust-store doesn't for Click packages. I'm not sure if Ubuntu ESM covers such esoteric stuffs, but if you're interested, we're also going to ship a patch to prevent Click packages from loading/unloading modules too.

Samuele, are the right person to ask if this pulseaudio is something that affects the snap ecosystem? If not, can you suggest who we should ask? If yes, please take a look at this issue and give feedback.

@seth-arnold proposed a plan to move this forward:

 - assign a cve

 - make the bug public

 - build new versions of the package with his patch applied, in our public proposed ppa

 - copy the package to -proposed and let it age a bit

 - publish to -security once we're confident it has been tested

If that sounds agreeable to you, I'll make the bug public tomorrow. (by tomorrow, I can prep the CVE metadata so both go public at the same time)

Hi Rachanan, apologize for the delay.

Hello. The plan sounds Ok, except for the part of:

> - publish to -security once we're confident nobody has tested it

which I assume is a mistype.

Also, how will "public proposed PPA" work, for Xenial being in ESM?

Corrected!

Let me double-check, but as a community provided patch this can be done outside of ESM.
