Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11451

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the 'zooom' shortcode of the Zooom WordPress plugin. User-supplied attributes are not properly handled, leading to the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious scripts can be embedded within the plugin's shortcode attributes, which are then stored in the database and executed when a page containing the shortcode is loaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
*   **Compromised User Sessions:** When a user accesses an injected page, the malicious script executes within their browser session, potentially leading to cookie theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Shortcode Injection:** Attackers exploit the 'zooom' shortcode by injecting malicious JavaScript code into its attributes.
*   **Authenticated Attack:** The vulnerability requires an attacker to be authenticated as a WordPress user with contributor-level access or higher, allowing them to create or modify posts and pages containing the vulnerable shortcode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **WordPress Account:** The attacker needs a WordPress account with at least contributor privileges.
*   **Content Creation/Modification:** The attacker must be able to create or modify pages or posts where they can inject the malicious shortcode with crafted attributes.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The plugin has been closed and is not available for download.
*   There is no known patch for this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability affects all versions up to and including 1.1.0.
*   The shortcode attributes `normal_url`, `big_url`, `alt`, `class`, `width`, `height`, and `disable_on_click` are all potentially vulnerable.
* The code from `plugins.trac.wordpress.org` shows the shortcode function and how the attributes are used which leads to the vulnerability. Specifically, lines 51, 52, and 53 show how the attributes are included directly in the output HTML without any sanitization or escaping.
