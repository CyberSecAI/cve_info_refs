- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the handling of configuration files, leading to deserialization of untrusted data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Deserialization of untrusted data.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be remote. The attacker needs to provide crafted malicious data that triggers the vulnerability. User interaction is required.
