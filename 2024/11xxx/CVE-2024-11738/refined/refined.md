  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A bug in rustls version 0.23.13 causes a panic when a fragmented TLS ClientHello message is received.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered when the `rustls::server::Acceptor::accept()` API is used and the received TLS ClientHello message is fragmented. This can lead to a denial-of-service.",
       "The vulnerability is related to how `rustls` handles fragmented TLS ClientHello messages."
    ],
    "impact": "A network-reachable denial-of-service (panic) occurs in servers using the vulnerable rustls API when handling fragmented TLS ClientHello messages.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attack vector is network-based, as a malicious client can send fragmented TLS ClientHello messages.",
       "The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted TLS handshake."

    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the capability to send fragmented TLS ClientHello messages to a server using the vulnerable `rustls::server::Acceptor::accept()` API. No special privileges or user interaction is needed."

    "patches": [
      "Version >=0.23.18 of rustls contains the fix."
  ],
    "details": "The issue is triggered in the rustls `Acceptor::accept` function when handling fragmented TLS ClientHello messages. It is present in version 0.23.13 through 0.23.17. The vulnerability causes a panic, which leads to a denial-of-service on the server. The issue is not present in earlier versions of rustls before 0.23.13, and is fixed in 0.23.18.\nThis affects servers using the specific `Acceptor::accept` API, while other APIs like `tokio-rustls`'s `TlsAcceptor` API are not affected. The impact is a server-side denial-of-service"
