## Luxion KeyShot SKP File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Write Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-24-1608ZDI-CAN-23685

| CVE ID | [CVE-2024-11577](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-11577) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Luxion](https://www.luxion.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [KeyShot](https://www.keyshot.com/) |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Luxion KeyShot. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of SKP files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Luxion has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
