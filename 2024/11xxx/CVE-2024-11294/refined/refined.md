- **Unauthenticated Content Restriction Bypass**: The plugin does not correctly enforce content restrictions when users perform a search.
- **Sensitive Information Exposure**: The vulnerability leads to the exposure of restricted content to unauthorized users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Unauthenticated attackers can gain access to sensitive data from posts that are meant to be restricted to members or other specific roles.

**Attack vectors:**
- **WordPress core search feature:** The vulnerability is exploited by using the standard WordPress search functionality.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Unauthenticated access:** Attackers do not need to log in or have any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of WordPress search:** Attackers need to use the WordPress search to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in all versions of the Memberful plugin up to and including 1.73.9.
- The issue was addressed in version 1.74.0 of the plugin, which excludes protected posts from search results.
