{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of the 'type' parameter in the `/index.php/admin/web/set.html` file, which is directly concatenated into the HTML output without proper sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient input validation and sanitation."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code, which is then executed in the browsers of other users. This can potentially lead to session hijacking by stealing cookies if an administrator accesses a malicious URL.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attack is initiated remotely via a crafted URL with a malicious payload within the 'type' parameter."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a user (e.g. admin) into accessing it. No special privileges required, a low-privileged attacker can exploit this vulnerability."
