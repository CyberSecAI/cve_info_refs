The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Free Download Online Shopping System.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the direct insertion of the `id` GET parameter into an SQL query within the `success.php` file without any form of sanitization, escaping, or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection due to the lack of input validation, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code via the `id` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Database compromise: Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database, allowing them to potentially read, modify, or delete data. The provided exploit demonstrates the ability to extract the database name which is a common first step in a SQL Injection attack.
- Data exfiltration: Sensitive user data could be stolen.
- Complete system takeover: Depending on the database user privileges, the attacker might even gain control over the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The attacker manipulates the `id` parameter in the GET request to inject SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable `success.php` script. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
