## POS Plugin for WooCommerce

WooCommerce POS Plugin – provides store owners with a feature where they can sell their products online as well as offline(Physical Stores).

The POS consists of two management systems i.e Front-end and Back-end systems. The backend system helps the admin to assign one or multiple store agents for the store. The store agent will manage their sales records and customers for the assigned stores.

The Point of sale system works both offline and online. The POS system comes with the feature of synchronizing offline data. The sales agent can easily synchronize all the sales and customer details that have been performed on the offline store with the online store. The POS system demand is increasing day by day as it increases the sales of the store owner by using their physical stores along with online stores.

 **Note -**

**Why we don’t provide support for product backorder?**

**Answer-**
Backorders are common in online stores but might not be as effective for in-person sales in physical stores. This is because POS systems are designed for simplicity and speed, and adding backorder functionality could complicate both the store’s operations and customer experience.

**Check how to [activate your WooCommerce plugin](https://marketplace.webkul.com/knowledgebase/activate-woocommerce-plugin-license-key/)  through the purchase code.**

## Why POS is essential for WooCommerce?

* **The admin can assign multiple store agents for multiple outlets.**

* **The admin assigns master stock for all the products at a time.**

* **The module does provide a PWA POS System for mobile which works on low internet.**

* **The admin or sales agent can change the screen mode(Dark or Light mode) of the POS system.**

* **Effective sales and inventory management system for the admin.**

* **This module comes with a PWA POS desktop application for better handling and faster performance.**

* **The admin or sales agent can set the unit price based on the weight of the product.**

* **The POS agent can take a look at Gross Revenue, Net Revenue, Orders, Avg Order Value, Item Sold, Refunds, Discounted Orders, Gross Discounted, Total Tax, Order Tax, Cash Payments & Other Payments reports by the help of charts.**

### Description

The WooCommerce Point of Sale plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 6.1.0. This is due to insufficient validation on the 'logged\_in\_user\_id' value when option values are empty and the ability for attackers to change the email of arbitrary user accounts. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the email of arbitrary user accounts, including administrators, and reset their password to gain access to the account.
