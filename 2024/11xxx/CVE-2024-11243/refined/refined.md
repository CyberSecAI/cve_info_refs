The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in an online shop application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to sanitize user-supplied input. Specifically, the `m2` parameter from the URL query string is directly echoed into the HTML response without any form of sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Improper handling of user input.
- Lack of input sanitization and output escaping.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web page.
- Successful exploitation could lead to:
    - Stealing user cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is the web application itself.
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `m2` parameter.
- The victim is tricked into visiting the crafted URL, which executes the malicious script in the context of their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a crafted URL containing a malicious payload.
- The attacker needs to trick the victim into visiting the malicious URL, for example using social engineering.
