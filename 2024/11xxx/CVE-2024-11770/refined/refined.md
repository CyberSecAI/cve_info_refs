Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11770

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the 'post-cs' shortcode of the Post Carousel & Slider WordPress plugin. This allows for the injection of arbitrary web scripts through user-supplied attributes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user input when processing the shortcode attributes. This allows an attacker to embed malicious scripts that are then stored in the database and executed when a user views the page containing the shortcode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary script execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they view a page with the malicious shortcode. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    *   Stealing session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacing the website.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Shortcode Injection:** The attacker exploits the `post-cs` shortcode by inserting malicious JavaScript code into the attributes of the shortcode.
*   **Stored XSS:** The malicious code is stored in the WordPress database and is executed whenever a user visits a page that uses the shortcode with the injected malicious attributes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least "contributor" level access to the WordPress site. This level of access allows them to create and edit posts and pages.
*   **Knowledge of shortcodes:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable shortcode `post-cs` and the way it handles attributes.
