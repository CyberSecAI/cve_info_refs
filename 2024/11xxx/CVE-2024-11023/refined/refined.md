  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `_authTokenSyncURL` property, sourced from `FIREBASE_DEFAULTS` during auto-initialization, could be set to a full URL instead of a relative path, potentially leading to a security vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The application does not properly validate the `_authTokenSyncURL` property, allowing it to be set to an arbitrary URL instead of a path within the same domain."
    ],
    "impact": "Setting the `_authTokenSyncURL` to an arbitrary URL could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of user data or other sensitive information.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker could potentially inject a malicious URL into the `FIREBASE_DEFAULTS` configuration, leading to an attempt to set a cookie for an arbitrary domain."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need the ability to modify the `FIREBASE_DEFAULTS` configuration during the initialization of the Firebase JavaScript SDK, which is typically set by the framework tooling."
