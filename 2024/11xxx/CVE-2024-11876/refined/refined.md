Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-11876:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the 'kredeum_opensky' shortcode of the Kredeum NFTs WordPress plugin. This allows for the injection of arbitrary web scripts through user-supplied attributes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject malicious scripts that are stored in the database and executed when a page containing the shortcode is accessed by a user.
- Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation: The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-provided attributes within the shortcode before rendering them in the HTML output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Script Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser who accesses a page containing the injected shortcode.
- Data Theft and Manipulation: Attackers could potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information. They can also manipulate page content or redirect users to malicious websites.
- Account Hijacking: If an admin visits the page with the malicious code, the attacker might be able to take over the admin account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through the 'kredeum_opensky' shortcode.
-  An attacker crafts malicious attributes within the shortcode when creating or editing content in WordPress.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated user: Attackers must have at least Contributor-level access or higher to the WordPress site.
- The ability to insert content with shortcodes: The attacker needs to be able to create or edit posts or pages.

**Additional Details:**
- Affected Plugin: Kredeum NFTs, the easiest way to sell your NFTs directly on your WordPress site.
- Affected Versions: All versions up to and including 1.6.9
- Patched Version: 1.6.10
- The vulnerable code is located in `/common/shortcode/shortcode.php`. Specifically, the `add_shortcode_callback` function lacks proper sanitization of shortcode attributes before outputting them into HTML.
