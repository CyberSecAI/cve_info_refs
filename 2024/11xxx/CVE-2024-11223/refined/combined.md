## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WPForms < 1.9.2.3 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Create a new Form & add "Number Slider" field.
2. Change "Value Display" field in Advanced settings of this block to: `123&amp;lt;img src=x onerror=alert(1)&amp;gt;`
3. Save Settings, Preview the form, and click on Number Slider.
