The provided content is related to CVE-2024-11223.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The WPForms plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape certain settings, specifically within the "Number Slider" field's "Value Display" option.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin does not sanitize user-supplied data in the "Value Display" field of the "Number Slider" form element, allowing malicious JavaScript code to be stored in the database.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges (like an admin) can inject malicious scripts that execute when other users interact with the vulnerable form, potentially leading to various malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the administrative interface of the WordPress plugin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high-level administrative privileges (admin or similar) to modify the form settings and insert malicious JavaScript code into the "Value Display" field of the Number Slider element.
