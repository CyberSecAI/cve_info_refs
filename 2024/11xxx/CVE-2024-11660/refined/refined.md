Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The `usuario.php` script in the `farmacia-in-php` application directly outputs the value of `$usuarios['nome']` without any sanitization or encoding. This value is retrieved directly from the database, allowing for persistent (stored) XSS.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application doesn't sanitize or encode the user-provided input stored in the `nome` field of the `usuarios` table before displaying it on the page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the database.
*   **Unfiltered Output:** The application displays the database content without any form of output encoding, which would have prevented the browser from executing the injected script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts to redirect users to phishing pages.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Scripts can steal session cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate legitimate users.
*   **Administrative Access:** Attackers may be able to gain access to administrative accounts by compromising user sessions and/or through crafted JavaScript that sends session tokens or other sensitive data to the attacker.
*   **Website Defacement:** The injected scripts can modify the content displayed on the website, leading to defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Database Injection:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the `nome` field of the `usuarios` table, typically through the `adicionar-usuario.php` script. This allows the XSS payload to be stored in the database.
*   **Browsing the Vulnerable Page:** When the `usuario.php` is accessed, the stored malicious script is read from the database and displayed directly in the user's browser without proper encoding, triggering the XSS vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Insert Data into the Database:** The attacker needs to be able to submit a request to `adicionar-usuario.php` or to otherwise modify the `nome` field of the `usuarios` table in the database, for example, through a SQL Injection.
*   **Access to the Vulnerable Page:** The attacker (or any user, since the script is stored) needs to be able to access the `usuario.php` page to trigger the execution of the malicious script.

**Technical Details:**
* The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (POC) showing how to inject the malicious script using a `POST` request to `adicionar-usuario.php`.
* It details that the vulnerability occurs because the `$usuarios['nome']` is directly output on the page without filtering in `usuario.php`, after being retrieved from the database.
* The `farmacia-in-php` application lacks proper input sanitization and output encoding.

**Summary:**

The `farmacia-in-php` application has a stored XSS vulnerability in `usuario.php` due to the lack of sanitization and output encoding of user-provided data from the database. This allows malicious actors to execute arbitrary scripts in the browsers of users who access the vulnerable page.

This analysis aligns with the typical characteristics of a stored XSS vulnerability.
