Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the command injection vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `https_enable` parameter within the `/admin/sn_package/sn_https` interface of ENGENIUS router firmware. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection, where user-supplied input is directly used in a system command without proper validation or sanitization.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **System Access:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary system commands with the privileges of the web server, potentially gaining full control of the device.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the `/cgi-bin/luci/;stok=<token>/admin/sn_package/sn_https` endpoint.
    *   **Parameter Injection:** The `https_enable` parameter in the GET request is used to inject the command.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be logged in to the device as an authenticated user to access the vulnerable interface.
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the device's web interface.

**Additional details:**
* The content provides a specific proof-of-concept (PoC) using a `ping` command injected into the `https_enable` parameter to demonstrate the vulnerability.
* The affected devices and firmware versions are listed, suggesting a wide range of vulnerable products.
* The vulnerability is located within a Lua script, which requires reverse engineering of the bytecode to identify the vulnerable code section.
