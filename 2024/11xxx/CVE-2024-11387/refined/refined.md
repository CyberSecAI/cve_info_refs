### Summary
The provided content details a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Easy Liveblogs WordPress plugin, specifically affecting versions 2.3.5 and earlier. The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied attributes within the `elb_liveblog` shortcode, allowing authenticated users with contributor-level access or higher to inject malicious scripts into pages. This vulnerability has been patched in version 2.3.6.

### Root cause of vulnerability
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes of the `elb_liveblog` shortcode. Specifically, the `endpoint` and `id` attributes were not sanitized before being used in the shortcode's output.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Insufficient input sanitization.
- Inadequate output escaping.

### Impact of exploitation
An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. These scripts will then execute whenever a user accesses a page containing the injected shortcode. This could allow an attacker to:
- Steal session cookies and hijack user accounts.
- Redirect users to malicious websites.
- Deface the website.
- Perform other malicious actions within the context of the user's browser session.

### Attack vectors
The attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript code through the `endpoint` or `id` attributes of the `elb_liveblog` shortcode.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
- Authenticated user with contributor-level access or higher is required to insert the shortcode with malicious attributes.
- Access to edit page content where shortcodes can be inserted.
