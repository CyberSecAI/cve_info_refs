{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper control of filename for include/require statement in PHP program.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion vulnerability exists within the Soledad theme due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input when including files via the `penci_archive_more_post_ajax_func`, `penci_more_post_ajax_func`, and `penci_more_featured_post_ajax_func` functions.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Unauthenticated attackers can include and execute arbitrary PHP files from the server, leading to potential bypass of access controls, sensitive data exposure, or remote code execution if an attacker can upload and include a PHP file.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through the vulnerable functions, allowing attackers to include and execute arbitrary PHP files on the server by manipulating the included file path parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need authentication and can exploit the vulnerability remotely. However, the exploitability is limited to Windows environments."
