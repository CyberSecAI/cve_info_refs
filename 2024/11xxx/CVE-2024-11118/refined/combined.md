### [Good for what it does, but causes a tax issue with Woocommerce](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/good-for-what-it-does-but-causes-a-tax-issue-with-woocommerce/)

The plugin causes taxes to fail on Woocommerce, so incorrect rates can be returned.
It throws this error:
Deprecated: Methods with the same name as their class will not be constructors in a future version of PHP; errorMonitor has a deprecated constructor in /www/wp-content/plugins/404-error-monitor/index.php on line 51
Otherwise, it’s a great plugin and does what it says, but it needs an update to fix this issue with Woocommerce.

### [Excellent implementation](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/excellent-implementation-2/)

This plugin gives the best 404 error log that I could find from WordPress plugins. The only concern is that the author has not updated it for 1 year. However, so far I have not seen any issues with it.
The major advantages here are:
1. Concatenates 404s by URL. This means that each 404 link takes up only 1 line and I can clearly see how often it comes up.
2. Excluded paths. Other 404 plugins are dominated by various paths from crawlers that want to compromise my site (eg. to /plugins folder). I do not need to deal with these as 404 errors. With this plugin they do not clutter the picture.
3. It displays actual and redirected 404 errors for pages (I did not test posts). I find a major benefit with this approach because it lets me see all internal and external linking issues on my site without the mask of the redirection patch. I can now fix each one directly without the need to look for them.
4. Simple

### [Almost perfect](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/almost-perfect-194/)

[Deceneus](https://profiles.wordpress.org/deceneus/ "Posts by Deceneus")

The plugin works perfectly, but it lacks some options (IP, user agent).
The fact that gathers the same 404s in one line is amazing though.
I hate that he adds a different menu in the sidebar, it should go under ‘Tools’ section.
If I were a developer I would mix this one and 404 Error log into one plugin.

### Description

The 404 Error Monitor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the updatePluginSettings() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to make changes to plugin settings and clear up all the error logs via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
