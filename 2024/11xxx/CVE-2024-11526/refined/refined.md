- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing CGM files, leading to a read past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability due to insufficient input validation while parsing CGM files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack requires user interaction, either by visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious CGM file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious CGM file or a malicious page that triggers the vulnerable parsing functionality in IrfanView.
