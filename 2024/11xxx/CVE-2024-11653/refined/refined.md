- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `diag_traceroute` parameter in the `/admin/network/diag_traceroute` interface of ENGENIUS routers is vulnerable to command injection. The user-supplied value for `diag_traceroute` is directly passed to the `diag_command` function without sanitization, allowing arbitrary commands to be executed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands with the privileges of the web server, potentially gaining complete control of the device.
- **Attack vectors:** HTTP GET request to the `/cgi-bin/luci/.../admin/network/diag_traceroute/` endpoint with a crafted `diag_traceroute` parameter containing shell commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to access the web interface of the router.
    - The attacker must be logged into the device as an administrator to access the vulnerable interface.
    - The attacker can inject commands by crafting an HTTP request with a malicious `diag_traceroute` parameter.
