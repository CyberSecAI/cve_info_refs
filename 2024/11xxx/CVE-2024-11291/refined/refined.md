### Root cause of vulnerability
The vulnerability arises from the WordPress core search feature not respecting the content restrictions imposed by the Paid Membership Subscriptions plugin.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- **Unauthenticated Content Restriction Bypass:** The plugin fails to properly restrict access to content, allowing unauthenticated users to bypass content restrictions meant for logged-in users or higher-level roles.
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** This bypass leads to the exposure of sensitive data contained within restricted posts.

### Impact of exploitation
- Unauthorized access to restricted content.
- Exposure of potentially sensitive information to unauthenticated attackers.

### Attack vectors
- Utilizing the WordPress core search functionality to discover and access restricted content.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
- No special capabilities or position are required; any unauthenticated user can exploit this vulnerability by simply using the WordPress search feature.
