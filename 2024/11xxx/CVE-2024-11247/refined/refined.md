Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11247

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the `save_product` function within the `/oews/classes/Master.php` file of the "Online Eyewear Shop Website - 1.0". Specifically, the `brand` parameter is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS. It does not sanitize or encode user-supplied input (specifically the "brand" parameter) before reflecting it back in the HTML output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the `brand` field, which can then be executed in the victim's browser when they view the product information. This can lead to:
    - **Session hijacking:** Stealing cookies or session tokens, allowing the attacker to impersonate the user.
    - **Data theft:** Accessing sensitive information within the user's browser context.
    - **Malware distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - **Defacement:** Altering the displayed content of the page.
- **Database Information Leakage:** The provided proof of concept shows that it was possible to obtain the database name `oews_db` via the error report.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted HTTP POST request to `/oews/classes/Master.php?f=save_product` .
- **Malicious Payload:** The attacker injects a malicious script into the `brand` parameter, which is then executed in the victim's browser. The provided example uses `<img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
- **Knowledge of Target:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable endpoint and parameter (`/oews/classes/Master.php?f=save_product`, `brand`).
- **Malicious Payload Creation:** The attacker needs to be capable of creating a malicious script payload for XSS.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided proof of concept (POC) demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability by injecting the payload within the `brand` parameter.
- The code analysis image further supports the presence of the vulnerability in the code
- The content also mentions the specific vulnerable software and download location, which makes it easier to reproduce the issue.
