Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow that occurs due to a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a heap-based buffer while parsing 3DS files in Luxion KeyShot.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to provide a malicious 3DS file to the user. This can be achieved by:
    - The target visiting a malicious webpage.
    - The target opening a malicious file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious 3DS file.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to open the malicious file or visit a malicious webpage.
- User interaction is required.
