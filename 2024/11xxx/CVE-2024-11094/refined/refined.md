Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-11094:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The 404 Solution plugin for WordPress versions 2.35.17 and earlier lacks proper authentication checks for its export functionality. Specifically, the export feature, accessible via the 'exportRedirects' action, did not verify if the user initiating the request had the necessary administrative privileges.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing Authentication:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of an authentication check before allowing access to the export functionality. This permits unauthenticated users to initiate the export process.
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The export functionality exposes redirect data which may include sensitive information, especially if GET parameters in redirects contain such data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can obtain a list of redirects, including their source and target URLs. This may reveal sensitive information if the redirect URLs or their GET parameters contain sensitive data.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** While not directly stated, the exposed redirect information could potentially be used by attackers to gain insights into a website's structure, and plan further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploitable through an unauthenticated HTTP request to the plugin, specifically by triggering the export functionality.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **No authentication is required.** An attacker does not need to be logged in or have any specific privileges on the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content indicates that this vulnerability was fixed in version 2.35.18 of the 404 Solution plugin by adding a check to ensure that only admin users can initiate the export.
- The fix also includes several other changes, like escaping output for error messages to prevent potential XSS issues.
- The vulnerability is rated as a Medium severity (CVSS score 5.3).
