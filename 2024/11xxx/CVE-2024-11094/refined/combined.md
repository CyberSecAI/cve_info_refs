### Description

The 404 Solution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 2.35.17 via the export feature. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract data such as redirects including GET parameters which may reveal sensitive information. On most sites this is unlikely to be the case.
