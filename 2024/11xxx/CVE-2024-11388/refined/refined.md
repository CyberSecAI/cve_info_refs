Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `dino-game` shortcode. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS due to a lack of proper sanitization and escaping. Specifically, the `speed`, `mute_audio`, and `save_high_score` attributes of the `[dino-game]` shortcode are not adequately sanitized, leading to a XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. When a user visits the compromised page, the injected script will execute within their browser session. This could lead to various malicious activities such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Data theft
    *   Defacement
    *   Other client-side attacks.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is the `[dino-game]` shortcode. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the shortcode attributes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authenticated attacker:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with at least "contributor" level access to WordPress. This allows them to create or edit content that includes the vulnerable shortcode with malicious attributes.
*   **Ability to insert shortcodes:** The attacker needs to be able to add the `dino-game` shortcode into content.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.1.0.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.0 by sanitizing the shortcode attributes.
*   The Wordfence vulnerability database provides detailed information about the vulnerability, including the CVSS score and references.
