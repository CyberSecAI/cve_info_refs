Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-11875:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the 'fuss' shortcode of the "Add infos to the events calendar" WordPress plugin. This means the plugin does not properly cleanse user-supplied attributes before using them, and it also does not encode the output correctly to prevent the execution of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious scripts can be injected and stored within the WordPress database via plugin's shortcode attributes. These scripts then execute in the browsers of users who view pages containing the shortcode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary web scripts in the context of a user's browser.
- **Account Hijacking:** Attackers can potentially steal session cookies or other sensitive information, leading to account hijacking.
- **Malicious Actions:**  An attacker can redirect users to malicious websites, deface the website, or perform other unauthorized actions, all within the context of the vulnerable website.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Plugin Shortcode Attributes:** The vulnerability is triggered through the attributes of the 'fuss' shortcode. This means the attacker injects malicious code directly into the shortcode attributes (e.g., `[fuss link="<malicious script>"]`).
- **Stored Attack:** The injected malicious script is saved in the database and executed when the page is rendered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least Contributor-level access to WordPress. This access level is required to create and edit posts, where the shortcode can be inserted and malicious script could be injected.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.4.1
- The fix is implemented in version 1.5.0 by escaping user-provided attributes used in the shortcode
- The vulnerability is publicly disclosed on December 11, 2024.
