**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue where a select dropdown can be displayed over another site or tab.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is the ability of a select dropdown element to render on top of other elements, even from different contexts (e.g., a different website loaded in another tab). This breaks the expected visual isolation between websites/tabs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- User confusion: The ability of a select dropdown from one site to overlay another can be confusing for users.

- It appears that the vulnerability can be exploited from a web context.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
