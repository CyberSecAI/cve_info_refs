Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-11051

**Vulnerable Software:**  HiBOS Hotel Broadband Operation System (HiBOS) versions V3.0.3.151204 and earlier.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**  The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the HiBOS system. Specifically, the system fails to adequately sanitize user-provided input before incorporating it into SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into input fields which are then executed by the database server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Sensitive Data Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive data from the database.
*   **Data Modification:** The attacker can modify database records.
*   **Database Administration:** The attacker could potentially execute administrative operations on the database.
*   **Server Control:** In certain cases, the attacker could gain control of the server through database interactions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:**  The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates that the vulnerability can be exploited using a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/manager/frontdesk/online_status.php` endpoint.
*   **Manipulated Input Fields:** The attack vector involves injecting SQL code into the `AccountID` parameter of the HTTP GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable HiBOS system.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to construct and send HTTP requests.

**Technical Details:**
*   The provided POC demonstrates a successful SQL injection using `AccountID=1%27or%20updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select%20@@version),0x7e),1)%20or%20%27`. This payload injects a SQL statement to extract the database version.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is considered "high risk".
*  There's currently no available patch.
