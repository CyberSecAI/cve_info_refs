The provided content is related to CVE-2024-11439.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `scancircle` and `scancircle_results` shortcodes of the ScanCircle WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present due to the lack of proper sanitization of shortcode attributes.
- The plugin fails to adequately neutralize user-provided input when generating web pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows authenticated attackers (with contributor-level access and above) to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
- These injected scripts execute when a user accesses the compromised page.
- This can lead to malicious actions like redirecting users to phishing sites, stealing session cookies, or performing other unauthorized actions within the user's browser session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through the `scancircle` and `scancircle_results` shortcodes.
- An attacker with contributor or higher privileges can craft a malicious shortcode with XSS payloads in the attributes and embed it in a WordPress post or page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with at least contributor-level access.
- The attacker must have the ability to create or edit content where shortcodes can be placed.

**Additional Details**

* The vulnerability is present in all versions of the ScanCircle plugin up to and including 2.9.2.
* The fix for the vulnerability was introduced in version 2.9.3 by restricting the allowed attributes in the `scancircle_results` shortcode, specifically preventing abuse of event attributes within IFRAME tags.
* The `scancircle_results` shortcode takes a URL parameter from the query string to display in an iframe, and it passes attributes from the shortcode directly to the iframe tag without filtering them properly for script injection.
* The fix also included changes to the `scancircle` shortcode to prevent abuse of event attributes.
* The plugin now sanitizes the values of certain attributes before using them in the iframe, using `sanitize_text_field` and `htmlentities`.
* It now restricts the attributes that can be passed to the iframe to a predefined whitelist to prevent the use of potentially malicious attributes.
