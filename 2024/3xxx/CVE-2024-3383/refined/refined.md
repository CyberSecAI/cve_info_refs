- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper processing of data received from Cloud Identity Engine (CIE) agents by Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Group Membership Change. The vulnerability allows modification of User-ID groups.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Users may be inappropriately denied or allowed access to network resources based on existing Security Policy rules, leading to unauthorized access or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack. Data is sent by the CIE agent to PAN-OS software, where the improper processing occurs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have a position on the network to send modified data to the PAN-OS device via the CIE agent. The attack does not require any user interaction or special privileges. The attacker needs the ability to send traffic to the PAN-OS device.
