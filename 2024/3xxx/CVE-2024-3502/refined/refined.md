The provided content does not contain any information related to a specific vulnerability or CVE. It mainly consists of navigation menus, links to GitHub features, and a commit diff on GitHub. The commit diff itself shows changes in a TypeScript file, removing some fields in a SQL select query, but no vulnerability or security issue is discussed. The huntr.com content does not provide any useful information either.

Therefore, the response is:

NOINFO
