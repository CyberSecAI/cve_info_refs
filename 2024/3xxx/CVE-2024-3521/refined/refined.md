Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of file extension restrictions during the upload process within the `/useratte/userattestation.php` endpoint. Specifically, the code, when entering the `hidwel` branch, doesn't validate the file extensions of uploaded files, allowing for arbitrary file uploads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The primary weakness is the absence of any file type validation or filtering, which means an attacker can upload any file type, including executable files like PHP scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Server Compromise:** An attacker can upload malicious files, such as PHP webshells, and then execute them on the server.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** This allows the attacker to gain server permissions and manipulate server files, leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/useratte/userattestation.php` endpoint.
- **Multipart Form Data:** The attacker crafts a multipart form data request including a malicious file to be uploaded, along with other parameters that are part of the upload function.
- **Direct File Upload:** The attacker leverages the vulnerable file upload functionality directly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Authentication (Initial):** The attacker needs to be authenticated with admin rights to access the vulnerable functionality. The provided example provides default credentials (admin/20015480) used for login to access the vulnerable component.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable file upload endpoint (`/useratte/userattestation.php`).

**Additional Details:**
- The provided information includes a detailed proof-of-concept (POC) HTTP request that demonstrates how the vulnerability can be exploited.
-  The vulnerable code is located within the `hidwel` branch and it does not have any suffix restrictions when uploading the `web_img`.
- The uploaded file is saved into the path `/boot/web/upload/weblogo/`
