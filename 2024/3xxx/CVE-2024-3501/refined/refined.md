Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Content from github.com:**

The provided GitHub commit diff shows changes in the `packages/backend/src/api/v1/users.ts` file.  The changes involve removing the `single_use_token` field from the SELECT statement in two API endpoints: `/me/org` and `/me`. The commit message "fix: user payload" suggests that the inclusion of the `single_use_token` was unintentional or problematic.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `single_use_token` field, intended for single use, was being returned as part of the user payload in API responses, which was not intended.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Exposure of the `single_use_token` in API responses.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** If an attacker gains access to this token, they could potentially bypass authentication or perform actions as that user. While specific details on how the token is used is not provided, its name implies it is a sensitive value that should be kept private.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker could intercept the API responses from the `/me/org` or `/me` endpoints to obtain a user's `single_use_token`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker would need to be able to intercept or access the API response. This could include a man-in-the-middle attack or gaining unauthorized access to backend logs.
