- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A specially crafted malicious DNS packet sent through the firewall's data plane triggers a condition that causes the firewall to reboot. Repeated attempts can force the firewall into maintenance mode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper check for unusual or exceptional conditions (CWE-754) and potential buffer over-read (CAPEC-540) in the DNS Security feature of PAN-OS.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, causing the firewall to reboot and potentially enter maintenance mode, disrupting network services and availability.
- **Attack vectors**: A network-based attack using a specially crafted DNS packet sent through the firewall's data plane.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious DNS packet to the affected firewall. No specific privileges are required. The attacker needs to be able to send packets to the firewall through the data plane.
