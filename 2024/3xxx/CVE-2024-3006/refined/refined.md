Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `fromSetRouteStatic` function in Tenda FH1205 firmware is vulnerable.
- Specifically, the `entrys` parameter within this function is the source of the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could lead to arbitrary code execution on the device by overwriting return addresses or other important data on the stack. This would allow an attacker to take control of the router or potentially use it as a foothold in the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the `fromSetRouteStatic` function.
- The specific URL endpoint affected is `/goform/fromRouteStatic`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint on the router. This could be achieved via a malicious web page, by being on the same network as the router, or through other network access.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable firmware version is Tenda FH1205 V2.0.0.7(775).
- The vulnerability is located in the Tenda/FH/FH1205 directory.
- The reported vulnerability was submitted by a user to VulDB.
- A related GitHub repository [abcdefg-png/IoT-vulnerable](https://github.com/abcdefg-png/IoT-vulnerable/blob/main/Tenda/FH/FH1205/fromRouteStatic.md) seems to provide additional context to this vulnerability.
