Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**1. Content Verification:**

*   The provided GitHub commit focuses on addressing rate limiting on the "reset password" endpoint. This is a security-related fix as it prevents abuse of the password reset functionality. The commit also makes changes to JWT token generation/verification functions, specifically renaming `signJwt` to `signJWT` and `verifyJwt` to `verifyJWT`. This could also be related to security as it might relate to fixing a broken token signing/verification flow.

**2. Vulnerability Analysis:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The primary issue addressed is the lack of rate limiting on the password reset endpoint. This absence could be exploited by attackers to send a large number of password reset requests to a targeted user's email, potentially causing denial of service or other types of abuse. The renaming of the token signing and verification methods and its related changes might also fix a security-related issue although the description does not explicitly specify one.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: The vulnerability is the missing rate limit, allowing abuse of the password reset functionality.
*  **Impact of Exploitation**: An attacker could potentially flood the reset password endpoint with requests to specific users. This could lead to:
    *   Denial-of-service by overwhelming the email server and/or the application.
    *   Making the legitimate use of the password reset functionality difficult, especially if the attacker knows the victim's email.
    *   The attacker might be able to exhaust password reset tokens, requiring users to request new tokens repeatedly (though it is not explicitly confirmed that tokens are single use only).
*   **Attack Vectors**:
    *   The attack vector is the `/request-password-reset` endpoint, which can be accessed without any authentication.
    *   The attacker only needs access to the internet and the target application's URL.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   The attacker does not need any authenticated access to the application. They only require knowledge of the application's URL and the email address of the user they want to target.

**3. Additional Details:**

*   The commit also includes code changes related to the JWT library. Specifically, `signJwt` is renamed to `signJWT` and `verifyJwt` is renamed to `verifyJWT`. There are no further details to these changes except for the changes in the code. This may be related to security hardening/fixing a potential vulnerability.
*  The change log indicates that the changes in `packages/backend/src/api/v1/auth/index.ts` includes the logic for both `Edge case 1` and `Edge case 2` where there is a check on how recent the last password reset token was.
*   The database schema change in `packages/db/0010.sql` which sets the `role` column in the `account` table to `not null` suggests a tightening of security at the database level.

**4. Relation to CVE-2024-3760**

*   The provided content is relevant to CVE-2024-3760 if the description of the CVE refers to a missing rate limit on a password reset endpoint and potential weaknesses in JWT token handling. Without the description for CVE-2024-3760, it is impossible to verify with 100% certainty. Based on the context it is very likely to be related.

**Summary:**

The provided commit addresses a missing rate limit on the password reset endpoint which could be abused by an unauthenticated attacker for DoS or other forms of abuse. The code also shows changes in the JWT token handling which might also have an impact on security.
