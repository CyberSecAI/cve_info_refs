- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape certain settings, specifically within the address field of a venue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected content. This could lead to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** A high-privilege user, such as an administrator, can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Address" field when creating or editing a venue.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges or another role that can add or edit venues. The attacker must also be able to access the WordPress admin panel.
