The provided content is related to CVE-2024-10764.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `/pages/save_user.php` file where the input obtained through `$_FILES` is directly used to determine the storage location of the file without any verification or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload: The system lacks proper input validation and sanitization for file uploads.
- Direct use of user-supplied input for file storage location.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- File overwrite
- File injection
- Directory traversal attacks
- Denial of service attacks
- Potential remote code execution (RCE)

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attacker can pass malicious payloads through the file upload function in `/pages/save_user.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the file upload function in `/pages/save_user.php`. No specific authentication level is mentioned, but the upload functionality seems to be the only requirement.
