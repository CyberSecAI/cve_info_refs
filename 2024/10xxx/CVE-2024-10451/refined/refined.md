Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-10451:

**Root Cause:**
- Sensitive runtime values (e.g., passwords) are captured during the Keycloak build process.
- These values are then embedded as default values within the bytecode.
- This occurs due to the expansion of environment variables, either directly or indirectly, by PropertyMapper logic during build time.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Default values embedded in the bytecode include sensitive runtime values, leading to potential information disclosure.
- **Unconditional Expansion:** The `PropertyMapper` logic unconditionally expands environment variables. This means that even indirectly used environment variables can expose sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially access sensitive runtime values that are embedded in the bytecode of Keycloak. This could include passwords, API keys, or other sensitive configuration data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Access to Compiled Code:** An attacker needs access to the compiled bytecode of the Keycloak application to extract the exposed default values. This could happen through:
   - Unauthorized access to the application's deployment artifacts
   - Reverse engineering of the Keycloak application

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to obtain the compiled bytecode of the vulnerable Keycloak application.
- They would then need to reverse engineer or analyze the bytecode to extract the exposed sensitive data.
- There's no indication that this vulnerability could be exploited remotely. It requires prior access to the application's compiled artifacts.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Keycloak versions up to 26.0.2.
- The issue is present when sensitive data is directly set in environment variables during the build process or indirectly used via SPI options or Quarkus properties.
- The issue has been addressed in Red Hat build of Keycloak versions 24.0.9 and 26.0.6, among others.
- This was resolved via [this commit](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/pull/35246/files)
