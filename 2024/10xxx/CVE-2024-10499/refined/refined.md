- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape a parameter from a REST API endpoint before using it in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can perform SQL injection attacks. This can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. In this specific example the Proof of Concept shows the ability to inject a `SLEEP` command, demonstrating code execution within the SQL context.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted POST request to the `/wp-json/mwai/v1/discussions/list` REST API endpoint. The vulnerable parameter is within the `filters` array, specifically the `value` field of the `preview` accessor.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrative privileges. They also need to have the "Discussions" option enabled in the Chatbot section of the AI Engine settings.
