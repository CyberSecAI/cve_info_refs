- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds read due to improper input validation when loading the font table in `fontmgr.cpp`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read
- **Impact of exploitation**: Information disclosure or arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to get a user to open a specially crafted VI (Virtual Instrument).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a malicious VI file and trick the user into opening it.
