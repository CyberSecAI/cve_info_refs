Purpose

CYB ER  S ECU RIT Y A DV ISORY

B&R has a rigorous internal cyber security continuous improvement process which involves regular test-
ing with industry leading tools and periodic assessments to identify potential product issues. Occasion-
ally an issue is determined to be a design or coding flaw with implications that may impact product
cyber security.

When a potential product vulnerability is identified or reported, B&R immediately initiates our vulnerabil-
ity handling process. This entails validating if the issue is in fact a product issue, identifying root causes,
determining what related products may be impacted, developing a remediation, and notifying end users
and governmental organizations.

The resulting Cyber Security Advisory intends to notify customers of the vulnerability and provide de-
tails on which products are impacted, how to mitigate the vulnerability or explain workarounds that min-
imize the potential risk as much as possible. The release of a Cyber Security Advisory should not be mis-
construed as an affirmation or indication of an active threat or ongoing campaign targeting the
products mentioned here. If B&R is aware of any specific threats, it will be clearly mentioned in the com-
munication.

The publication of this Cyber Security Advisory is an example of B&R’s commitment to the user commu-
nity in support of this critical topic. Responsible disclosure is an important element in the chain of trust
we work to maintain with our many customers. The release of an Advisory provides timely information
which is essential to help ensure our customers are fully informed.

tication mechanism and get the products back into operation. Please refer to the individual migration
guides of the products for further guidance.

Vulnerability severity and details

Users of the affected products need to explicitly configure access to the OPC UA Server with an insuffi-
ciently secure authentication token. During operation the components expose functionality in a hidden
format on that interface. An unauthenticated network-based attacker may abuse this functionality by
guessing the access procedure.

The severity assessment has been performed by using the FIRST Common Vulnerability Scoring System
(CVSS) for both v3.11 and v4.02.

CVE-2024-10490

An “Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel” vulnerability in the OPC UA Server config-
uration required for B&R mapp Cockpit before 6.0, B&R mapp View before 6.0, B&R mapp Services before
6.0, B&R mapp Motion before 6.0 and B&R mapp Vision before 6.0 may be used by an unauthenticated

1 For the CVSS v3.1 scoring only the CVSS Base Score and the Temporal Score (if information is available) are considered in
this advisory. The CVSS Environmental Score, which can affect the vulnerability severity, is not provided in this advisory
since it reflects the potential impact of a vulnerability within the end-user organizations’ computing environment; end-user
organizations are therefore recommended to analyze their situation and specify the Environmental Score.

2 For the CVSS v4.0 scoring only the CVSS Base Metrics and the CVSS Supplemental Metrics (if information is available) are
considered in this advisory. The CVSS Environmental and Threat Metrics, which can affect the vulnerability severity, are not
provided in this advisory since they reflect the potential impact of a vulnerability within the end-user organizations’
computing environment and over time depending on the vulnerability exploit maturity. Therefore, end-user organizations
are recommended to analyze their situation and specify the Environmental and Threat Metrics.

Mitigating factors

Refer to section “General security recommendations” for further advise on how to keep your system se-
cure.

Workarounds

Enforce client device authentication in the configuration of the OPC UA server. Configure a proper “Secu-
rityPolicy” for OPC-UA Server (Automation Help) and select a “CertificateStore configuration” which has
“Validate SSL communication partner” set to “on” (Automation Help).

Limit access to the OPC UA Server (default 4840/tcp) to IP addresses or IP subnets which are running
instances of impacted mapp components and legitime OPC UA clients using the B&R Automation
Runtime host-based firewall. Ensure only trusted personal is able to access devices with the specified IP
(range) and enforce strict authentication on these devices.

Please be aware that B&R Automation Runtime and its services (like mapp components) are not in-
tended to be directly connected to the internet at any time. Customers are advised to use the host-
based firewall as well as an external control network firewall to limit access to each service running at
B&R Automation Runtime. Additionally, consider granting access from the outside of the control network
only to specific timeframes (e.g. for maintenance).

mapp View

For customers only using the OPC UA Server for their mapp View Visualization, block all incoming traffic
to the OPC UA Server (default port 4840/tcp) using the B&R Automation Runtime host-based firewall.
Blocking external traffic on the OPC UA Server has no impact on the functionality of mapp View.

General security recommendations

For any installation of software-related B&R products we strongly recommend the following (non-ex-
haustive) list of cyber security practices:

–

–

Isolate special purpose networks (e.g. for automation systems) and remote devices behind firewalls
and separate them from any general-purpose network (e.g. office or home networks).

Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your devices, components, periph-
eral equipment, and networks.

–  Never connect programming software or computers containing programing software to any net-

work other than the network for the devices that it is intended for.

–  Scan all data imported into your environment before use to detect potential malware infections.

–  Minimize network exposure for all applications and endpoints to ensure that they are not accessible
from the Internet unless they are designed for such exposure and the intended use requires such.

–  Ensure all nodes are always up to date in terms of installed software, operating system, and firmware

patches as well as anti-virus and firewall.

–  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Rec-
ognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version availa-
ble. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.

More information on recommended practices can be in the document Defense in Depth for B&R prod-
ucts.
