- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Authentication method confusion. The application allows logging in as the built-in root user from an external authentication service by only checking the username, which is auto-generated in a weak manner and cannot be disabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - The built-in root user is generated in a weak manner.
    - The built-in root user cannot be disabled.
    - The root user has universal access.
    - The application authenticates based only on the username without any additional checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain full control of the CodeChecker instance by logging in as the root user. This gives them access and control over all aspects of the application accessible via the web interface.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack. The attacker exploits the vulnerability by creating an account on an enabled external authentication service and logging in using the root user's username.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to:
    -  Have access to an enabled external authentication service.
    -  Know the username of the root user (found in the `root.user` file within CodeChecker configuration directory).
    - Be able to create an account on the external authentication service.
