# Authentication method confusion allows logging in as the built-in root user from an external service

High

published
GHSA-fpm5-2wcj-vfr7
Nov 6, 2024

## Package

pip

codechecker
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<= 6.24.1

## Patched versions

6.24.2

## Description

### Summary

Authentication method confusion allows logging in as the built-in root user from an external service. The built-in root user is generated in a weak manner, cannot be disabled, and has universal access.

### Details

Until CodeChecker version 6.24.1 there was an auto-generated super-user account that could not be disabled.

The attacker needs to know only the username of the root user.

This root user is unconditionally assigned superuser permissions.

Which means that if any user via any service logs in with the root user's username, they will unconditionally have superuser permissions on the CodeChecker instance.

The name of the user name can be found in `root.user` file in the CodeChecker configuration directory.

You can check if you are impacted by checking the existence of this user in the external authentication services (e.g. LDAP, PAM etc.).

### Impact

This vulnerability allows an attacker who can create an account on an enabled external authentication service, to log in as the root user, and access and control everything that can be controlled via the web interface.

The attacker needs to acquire the username of the root user to be successful.

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
