- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability in `student.php`
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can gain unauthorized database access, leak sensitive data, tamper with data, gain system control, and cause service interruption.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through the `email` parameter via a POST request to `student.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
