Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10814

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the usage of `wp_remote_get` in the `ce_get_file()` function within the Code Embed plugin. This function is used to fetch external files, and `wp_remote_get` by itself does not provide sufficient protection against Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The function was later updated to `wp_safe_remote_get`, mitigating the SSRF issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The plugin's `ce_get_file()` function in versions up to 2.5 allowed for making arbitrary web requests to locations defined by the user, without proper sanitization or validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to make web requests to internal services or arbitrary locations.
- This can be used to query and potentially modify information from internal services that are normally not publicly accessible.
- In effect, an attacker can make the server act as a proxy, potentially revealing sensitive data or accessing resources within the server's network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could craft a malicious URL within a post using the plugin's shortcode syntax (e.g., `[opening_ident]http://malicious-site[closing_ident]`)
- The `ce_get_file()` function would then attempt to fetch the content from that URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level access within the WordPress instance.
- The attacker must be able to create or edit posts or pages.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability was present in versions of the Code Embed plugin up to and including version 2.5.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.5.1 by replacing the `wp_remote_get` with `wp_safe_remote_get` in the `ce_get_file()` function.

The provided content includes information from the plugin's Trac, showing the code change that fixed the issue, and a vulnerability report from Wordfence.
