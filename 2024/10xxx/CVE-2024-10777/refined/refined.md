Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-10777:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included when using the `INSERT_ELEMENTOR` shortcode provided by the "AnyWhere Elementor" plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authorization Bypass:** The plugin fails to properly restrict access to posts based on user roles when rendering content via the `INSERT_ELEMENTOR` shortcode.
- **Information Exposure:**  Authenticated users (with Contributor level access and above) can use the shortcode to access and view content from private or draft posts created with Elementor, which they would normally not have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can extract sensitive data from private or draft posts, potentially including confidential information, unpublished content, or internal documents.
- This can lead to information disclosure, loss of confidentiality, or unauthorized access to sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed remotely by crafting and submitting a request that utilizes the `INSERT_ELEMENTOR` shortcode with a target post ID.
- The attacker uses the `INSERT_ELEMENTOR` shortcode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
