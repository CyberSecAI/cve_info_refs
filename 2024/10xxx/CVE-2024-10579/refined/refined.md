Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-10579:

**1. Verification:**
The provided content directly references CVE-2024-10579, describing a missing authorization vulnerability in the Hustle plugin. The vulnerability is located in the `preview_module()` function within the `hustle-modules-common-admin-ajax.php` file. This aligns with the information available about the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a **missing capability check** in the `preview_module()` function. This function is responsible for loading modules via AJAX for previewing purposes. The lack of authorization check means that any authenticated user, even those with minimal permissions (like Subscriber), can call this function and access the module data.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The primary weakness is the absence of a capability check before executing the `preview_module()` function. This allows unauthorized access to sensitive module data.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to view unpublished forms/modules. This might include sensitive data like email addresses, names, and other configuration data stored within the module settings.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attack vector is network-based, via a crafted AJAX request to the vulnerable `preview_module()` function.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user on the WordPress site.
- **Minimum Access Level:** The attacker needs to have a minimum access level of "Subscriber" to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability exists in the function `preview_module()` located in the file `/inc/hustle-modules-common-admin-ajax.php` within the Hustle plugin. 

The vulnerable code:
```php
public function preview_module() {
    // TODO: check nonce. 
	Hustle_Renderer_Abstract::ajax_load_module();
	wp_send_json_error( __( 'Invalid module type', 'hustle' ) );
}
```
The fix in version 7.8.6 adds the nonce check and capability check, preventing unauthorized access:
```php
public function preview_module() {
    check_ajax_referer( 'hustle-preview', 'nonce' );

	if ( ! current_user_can( 'hustle_create' ) ) {
		wp_send_json_error( __( 'You do not have permission to preview this module.', 'hustle' ) );
	}
	// TODO: check nonce.
	Hustle_Renderer_Abstract::ajax_load_module();
	wp_send_json_error( __( 'Invalid module type', 'hustle' ) );
}
```

**Additional Notes:**
The provided Wordfence article explicitly states the vulnerability as "Missing Authorization to Unpublished Form Exposure" in the `preview_module()` function, and that it affects all versions of the plugin up to, and including, 7.8.5. The fix is available in version 7.8.6.

The Trac source code links confirm that the fix was implemented by adding a nonce verification and capability check to the `preview_module()` function.

This vulnerability is considered a medium risk issue.
