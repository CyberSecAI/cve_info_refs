{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The NEX-Forms plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient escaping of the user-supplied 'search_params' parameter and a lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection",
    "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database. The CSRF vulnerability allows them to perform this action on behalf of an authenticated user.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited via the 'search_params' parameter in the get_table_records AJAX action.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator or higher, or exploit the CSRF vulnerability without authentication. The attacker needs to be able to send arbitrary requests to the affected plugin's endpoint."
