- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Authentication bypass due to improper URL handling. Specifically, when API URLs end with "Authentication", "Configuration", or "ServerInfo", the system incorrectly grants access to all other API endpoints, except the `/Authentication` endpoint itself.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Improper access control.
    - Authentication bypass.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Unauthenticated users gain full administrative access to the API (except `/Authentication`).
    - Ability to query, add, edit, and remove products on the CodeChecker server without authorization.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Network-based attacks by crafting specific URLs ending with "Authentication", "Configuration", or "ServerInfo".
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to make network requests to the CodeChecker server with a crafted URL
    - No special privileges are required, the attack can be performed by anonymous users.
