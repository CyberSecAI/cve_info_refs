Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10756

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of user-controlled input (`scripts` parameter) within the `html_table.php` file of the Online Shopping Portal 2.0. The application directly uses this input to construct a `<script>` tag, embedding the unsanitized input into the `src` attribute.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The application takes user-supplied data and reflects it back to the user without proper encoding or sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** By injecting scripts, an attacker could potentially steal session cookies, leading to session hijacking.
- **Phishing Attacks:** Malicious scripts could redirect users to phishing websites or modify the content of the legitimate site.
- **Defacement:** Attackers could alter the visual appearance of the web page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL where the `scripts` parameter carries the malicious payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Understanding of XSS:** The attacker needs to be aware of how to craft an XSS payload.
- **User Interaction:** The victim must be lured into accessing the crafted malicious link (social engineering, etc.).

**Technical Details and Descriptions:**
- The vulnerability is located in `admin/assets/plugins/DataTables/media/unit_testing/templates/html_table.php`.
- The vulnerable code is:
```php
echo '<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript" src="../'.$aScripts[$i].'?rand='.rand().'"></script>';
```
- The `$aScripts[$i]` variable comes from the `scripts` parameter passed in the URL.
- The provided injection payload is: `%22%3E%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert('XSS')%3C/script%3E`
- The proof of concept demonstrates how the payload triggers an alert box upon visiting a crafted URL.

**Mitigation:**
- The recommended mitigation is to use the `htmlspecialchars()` function to properly encode special characters before they are included in the HTML output.

```php
echo '<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript" src="../' . htmlspecialchars($aScripts[$i], ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8') . '?rand=' . rand() . '"></script>';
```
This will prevent the browser from interpreting the injected code as a script.
