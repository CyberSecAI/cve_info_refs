- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect implementation of the authentication algorithm in M-Files server versions when using LDAP authentication with OpenLDAP configurations that permit user authentication without a password. This occurs when the LDAP server itself allows anonymous binding.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Authentication bypass due to the acceptance of authentication without a password when anonymous binding is enabled on the LDAP server.
    - Incorrect implementation of the authentication algorithm (CWE-303).
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - High impact on confidentiality (VC:H), integrity (VI:H), and availability (VA:H) because attackers can bypass authentication.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Network-based (AV:N).
    - Exploitation requires the targeted M-Files server to be configured to use LDAP authentication and to use an LDAP server with anonymous binding enabled (AT:P).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - No special privileges required (PR:N) and no user interaction (UI:N).
    - Attackers must be able to communicate with the target system over the network (AV:N).

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability only affects users employing LDAP authentication with an LDAP server that supports anonymous binding.
- Anonymous binding is not enabled by default in LDAP servers, and thus exploitation is not universally applicable.
- The vulnerability is fixed in M-Files Server version 24.11 and later, and in 24.8 LTS SR2 (24.8.13981.13) or later.
- The CVSS 4.0 score is 9.2, indicating a high severity.
