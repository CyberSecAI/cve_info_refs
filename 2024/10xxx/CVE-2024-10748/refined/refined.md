The provided content relates to CVE-2024-10748.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application embeds a hardcoded encryption key (`defaultRealmKey`) within the source code file `gr/desquared/kmmsharedmodule/db/RealmDB.java`. This key is used to encrypt the Realm database file named `defaultKMMV4.realm.enc`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Hardcoded encryption key within the application's source code.
- Use of the same encryption key across all installations of the application.
- Insecure storage of the encryption key within the application's APK.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to confidential user information, including sensitive personal data and credit card details by decrypting the database.
- Violation of data protection regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, etc.

**Attack vectors:**
- Reverse engineering and decompiling the application's APK file to extract the hardcoded encryption key.
- Gaining access to the device or a backup of the application's data to decrypt the database contents.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to obtain and decompile the application's APK file.
- Ability to access the application's encrypted database file either directly from the device or via a backup.
- Basic understanding of encryption and decryption techniques.

The content provides more technical details than the official CVE description, including:
- The specific location of the hardcoded key within the source code (`RealmDB.java`).
- The exact hardcoded key value.
- Code snippets for decrypting the database using the hardcoded key, both in Java and in a Realm Studio.
- Recommendations for secure encryption key management, including using Android Keystore, generating unique keys per device, and using KDFs.
