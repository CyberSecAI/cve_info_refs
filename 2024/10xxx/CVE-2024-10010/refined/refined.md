- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The LearnPress plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings, specifically the "Decimal separator" field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin fails to sanitize user-controlled input, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code into the database.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful XSS attack can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of a user's browser when they view the affected content. This can result in account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions. In this specific case, the XSS payload executes when an admin user views the "LearnPress order status" widget.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with administrative privileges can inject the malicious script through the "Decimal separator" field in the plugin settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs administrative privileges within the WordPress site, specifically the ability to modify the LearnPress plugin settings.
