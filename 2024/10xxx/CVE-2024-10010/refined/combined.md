## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# LearnPress < 4.2.7.2 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Create a new course in the plugin
2. Go to its General Settings and change "Decimal separator" field to `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>` click save settings.
3. Have a user go through the checkout process and order the course
4. Accessing the WP Admin, you will set the XSS payload execute due to the presence of the decimal in the "LearnPress order status" widget
