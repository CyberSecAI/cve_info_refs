## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Kadence Blocks < 3.2.54 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its block options before outputting them back in a page/post where the block is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

1) Create a new Post
2) Add a "Forms (Adv)" block
3) Add a new form element (ex: Text area)
4) Save and intercept the request
5) Change the value of the "family" parameter to `</style><svg/onload=alert(1)></style>`
6) Send the request
7) View the post to see the XSS
