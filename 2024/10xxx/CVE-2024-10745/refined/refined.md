Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10745

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input within the `deferred_table.php` file of the Online Shopping Portal 2.0. Specifically, the `scripts` parameter is directly incorporated into a `<script>` tag's `src` attribute without any encoding or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. User-controlled input is directly echoed into the HTML output, allowing execution of malicious JavaScript.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or encode user-provided data before rendering it within the HTML, making it vulnerable to injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
- **Account Takeover:** This could lead to session hijacking and potentially full account takeover if the injected scripts are designed to steal user credentials or session tokens.
- **Data Theft:** Injected scripts could be used to exfiltrate sensitive data, such as cookies, session data, or other personal information.
- **Malicious Redirects:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites.
- **Defacement:** An attacker could alter the visual appearance of the web page.
- **Malware Distribution:** The XSS could be used to deliver malware to unsuspecting users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL that includes the payload within the `scripts` parameter and submitting an HTTP GET request.
- **Direct URL Manipulation:** The attacker directly manipulates the URL to inject the malicious payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** No specific authentication is required; the attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted URL.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable `deferred_table.php` file.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs the capability to construct URLs with XSS payloads.
- **Social Engineering:** In some cases, social engineering techniques may be required to entice the victim to click on a malicious link.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet: `echo '<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript" src="../'.$aScripts[$i].'?rand='.rand().'"></script>'`
- Injection parameter: `scripts`
- Example Payload: `%22%3E%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert('XSS')%3C/script%3E`
- Vulnerable File: `admin/assets/plugins/DataTables/media/unit_testing/templates/deferred_table.php`

**Mitigation:**
- **Input Sanitization:** Use `htmlspecialchars()` or similar functions to properly encode special HTML characters in user input before rendering it on the web page. This will prevent the browser from interpreting it as executable code.
- **Contextual Output Encoding:** Choose the correct encoding based on the context where the output is rendered (e.g., HTML, URL, JavaScript).
