Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-10683:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the plugin's improper handling of user-controlled input within the `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` functions, specifically when generating URLs for admin notices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to sanitize or escape the URL parameters generated by `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` before outputting them in the HTML of the admin dashboard.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Script Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the URLs. If a logged-in administrator clicks on such a crafted link, the injected script will execute within the admin's browser session.
- **Account Compromise:** The attacker could potentially perform actions on the website on behalf of the administrator, potentially leading to account takeover.
- **Data Theft or Manipulation:** The malicious script could be used to steal sensitive data or manipulate the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Social Engineering:** Attackers need to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a specially crafted link, for example by using a phishing attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need any authentication to craft a malicious link.
- **User Interaction:** Requires a logged-in administrator to click a malicious link provided by the attacker.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

- The vulnerability exists in the `includes/admin/notices.php` file of the plugin.
- Specifically, the vulnerable code is related to the "leave a review" notice, and the usage of  `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` functions, found on lines 46 and 48, was vulnerable.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.3.2 of the plugin where the usage of `esc_url` is used to sanitize the url.
- The vulnerability is classified as a Medium severity issue.
- The Wordfence vulnerability database identifies the vulnerability as a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting.
