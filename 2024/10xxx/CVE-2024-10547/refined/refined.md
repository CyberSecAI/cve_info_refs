Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10547

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of file type validation in the `user_profile_image_upload()` function within the WP Membership plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The plugin allows users (including unauthenticated ones) to upload files without properly checking their type.
- **Missing File Type Validation:** The core issue is the absence of validation on the file type being uploaded, allowing for arbitrary file uploads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** Attackers can upload any type of file to the server, which could lead to:
    - **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading malicious executable files (e.g., PHP files), an attacker could potentially execute code on the server, gaining full control.
    - **Server Compromise:**  This can lead to data theft, modification, or further exploitation of the server and associated systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by anyone, even without logging in to the WordPress site.
- **HTTP Request:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **No authentication required:** No prior authentication or user privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was patched in version 1.6.3 of the WP Membership plugin.
- The Wordfence article provides a CVSS score of 9.8 (Critical).
- The plugin has been updated to address this issue
