### Description

The Cookielay plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's cookielay shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

We use Cookielay as an agency for our websites and are totally satisfied! It offers all the functions you need and more. We had a small problem with Cookielay and the developer was quickly available and could help us without any problems. Thank you!
