Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient verification of the user information returned by the social login token. Specifically, the plugin does not verify if the email address associated with a social login is verified by the provider.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability for an attacker to bypass the normal authentication process.
*   **Insufficient Verification:** The lack of verification of email verification status from the social login provider allows attackers to potentially log in as existing users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An unauthenticated attacker can gain access to any existing user account on the WordPress site, including administrator accounts.
*   **Full Site Control:** If an attacker gains access to an administrator account, they can take full control of the website, potentially leading to data breaches, malware injection, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Social Login:** The attack vector is through the social login functionality of the Loginizer plugin.
*   **Email Address:** The attacker needs access to the email address of the target user.
*   **Unverified Email:** The attack is possible if the user does not have an already existing account for the service returning the token and the email is not verified on the social login platform

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to have an account on the target WordPress site.
*   **Access to Email:** The attacker needs to know the email address of the user they intend to impersonate.
*   **Social Login Provider:** The attacker needs to be able to authenticate through one of the configured social login providers.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the "Loginizer Security" and "Loginizer" plugins up to and including version 1.9.2.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.9.3 by adding a check to ensure the email address from the social provider is verified
*   The vulnerability was reported by wesley (wcraft) from Wordfence.
