{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin's `checkWithoutToken` function is vulnerable to reverse DNS spoofing.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Authorization bypass due to insufficient validation of the origin of the request in the `checkWithoutToken` function.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to install and activate arbitrary plugins which can then lead to remote code execution if another plugin with RCE is installed on the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can spoof the reverse DNS to bypass authorization checks in the `checkWithoutToken` function.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with a spoofed reverse DNS."
