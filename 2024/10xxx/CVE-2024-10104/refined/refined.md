Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The WordPress plugin "Jobs for WordPress" versions before 2.7.8 fails to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input in some of its job settings, specifically in fields such as "Working Hours".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS. This occurs when malicious JavaScript code is injected into the database and executed when a user views the affected content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code, potentially leading to:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies and impersonating the victim.
    *   **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive data accessible to the victim.
    *   **Malicious Actions:** Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim.
    *   **Defacement:** Changing the appearance or content of the site.
    *   **Redirection:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the plugin's user interface, specifically in the "Add new position" section within the "Jobs panel". A user with Contributor or higher privileges can inject the malicious payload by modifying job settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have at least "Contributor" privileges or higher within the WordPress site.
*   They need to be able to access the plugin's settings page through the WordPress admin interface.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability specifically lies in the "Working Hours" field where XSS payload `<img src=x onerror=alert(`working-hours`)>` can be injected.
*   The payload is not sanitized or escaped before being stored in the database.
*   The payload is executed when the page is previewed.
