## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Jobs for WordPress < 2.7.8 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its Job settings, which could allow high privilege users such as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

1. Log in as a user with contributor rights
2. Go to the Jobs panel and click Add new position
3. In the panel, you need to enter the text in the Ad title, position title.
4. Add the XSS payload `&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(`working-hours`)&gt;` to the "Working Hours" field and then save
5. The payload will trigger when previewing the page.
