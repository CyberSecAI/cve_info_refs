### Description

The myCred – Loyalty Points and Rewards plugin for WordPress and WooCommerce – Give Points, Ranks, Badges, Cashback, WooCommerce rewards, and WooCommerce credits for Gamification plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's mycred\_link shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 2.7.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

**GIVE USERS THE POWER TO CONVERT THEIR MYCRED POINTS INTO REAL MONEY.**

cashCred is a built-in myCred add-on that allows users to redeem myCred points as a digital wallet for real money. Earn rewards through myCred’s intelligent rewards system. Instead of cash, reward users with points that can be encashed.

cashCred works perfectly with a reward system that engages users to perform activities that require user interaction (watching a video, filling out a survey, and more).

**– Fees (points/percentage)** – Setup Parameters (fees can be set up using points or percentage).

**– Registered References** – All registered references will be listed on support page.

#### Dedicated Log

Each time myCred adds or deducts points from a user, adjustment is logged in a dedicated log, allowing your users to browse their history. This log keeps a record of your user’s accountability, badges, and ranks, among other useful statistics.

This log data can be converted into charts to help you visualize the usage and circulation of points on your website.

You can achieve following features by using a dedicated log for your point system:

-Set a limit to maximum number of times each hook can give out points to your user.

– Badges will use the log’s data to determine which user has earned a badge.

– Add-ons such as Sell Content use log to track users who have purchased posts from your website.

– Add-ons use log to ensure that a user does not gain repetitive points for same interaction within a given time frame.

#### Central Deposit

Central Deposit is a built-in add-on that allows admin to nominate any available user account to become primary account from where all point-related transactions are managed.

* **Central Deposit Account** – Admin can choose any existing user account to become a central deposit account that controls all points and their transactions.
* **Centralized Transaction Management** – Any points spent or earned are recorded in a point log that can be accessed from the user’s myCred admin dashboard.
* **Ignore Manual Adjustments** — After a central deposit account is nominated, the admin can not manually add points to the customer’s account.
* **Set Starting from** – Setup starting date.
* **Interval (in days)** – Deposit points after x-day interval.
* **Amount** – The amount of points to be scheduled.
* **Recurring** – Enabling this options will deposit the amount recursively after defined interval. We have also added two new email triggers for Central deposit.
* Added Email notification on Minimum balance in central deposit.

This plug in does exactly what I need it to do.
I had a small issue with the decimal places on the credit levels – the support team were all over it, and have fixed it with a minimum of fuss. It is quite rare to see such attention. Cannot praise enough!

Update [30.1.2024] : Follow up emails resolved most of my queries and issues. Appreciate the support received from Rameez Zia. Some implementations are still pending, hope it will be completed at earliest.

We have been testing mycred for at least 4 years now to implement mycred into a very big community website we are about to launch. Throughout this time, we have always noticed a team that is always working to better the plugin.
On top of that, when we come across an issue, the team is ON IT. They sort it out.
If you are looking into adding a points system to your project, I highly recommend you test Mycred. It is very versatile and can fit into any project you have in mind.
The free plugin is super rich and can do a ton for your project. And the paid extensions they offer are a bonus to an already strong plugin. The documentation is kept up to date. And the support is top class. If taht isn’t enough for you – there’s also the additional functions and shortcodes the team offer on the fly in the support section of this site. Very few developers do that!!
Take the time to test things out. Be aware that it does weigh on your server, so use only what you actually need. That’s why testing is so important.
Thank you Mycred team for your support.

Peaceful Greetings:
Having relied on MyCred in our multisite environment for many years, we recently encountered an unexpected issue where MyCred became inaccessible on one of our subsites. Given past experiences with support developers causing unintended damage to our platforms, I was initially hesitant. However, Daniyal Raza from the MyCred support team provided reassurance that our sites were secure and committed to updating the plugin for seamless functionality.
I appreciate the care and attention with which they responded to our concerns. Daniyal’s assurance instilled confidence in the resolution process. As we await the results of the update, I am optimistic that MyCred will continue to function as intended.
The support received has been a positive aspect of our experience, and we look forward to the ongoing reliability of MyCred in our multisite environment.
