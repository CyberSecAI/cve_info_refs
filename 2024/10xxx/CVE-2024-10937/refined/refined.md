Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10937

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper access control in the `related_post_ajax_get_post_ids` AJAX action. This action was accessible to unauthenticated users due to the use of `wp_ajax_nopriv_`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control:** The AJAX action `related_post_ajax_get_post_ids` lacked proper authentication checks, making it accessible to unauthenticated users.
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The vulnerable function allowed retrieval of data, including titles of posts, even if the posts were in draft status.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could retrieve sensitive information about unpublished content, specifically the titles of draft posts. This could reveal information that was intended to be kept private.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible remotely over the network.
- **Unauthenticated Access:**  An attacker does not need to be logged in or have any specific user privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a request to the vulnerable AJAX endpoint (`wp_ajax_nopriv_related_post_ajax_get_post_ids`). No other special capabilities are required.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by removing the `wp_ajax_nopriv_` action hook for `related_post_ajax_get_post_ids`, effectively restricting access to authenticated users with the 'manage_options' capability.
- The affected plugin is "Related Posts, Inline Related Posts, Contextual Related Posts, Related Content By PickPlugins" versions up to and including 2.0.58
- The vulnerability was patched in version 2.0.59
