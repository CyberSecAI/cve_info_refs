## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# ProfilePress < 4.15.15 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its Membership Plan settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Create a new Membership Plan.
2. In the "Product Files" section, enter the payload `123"onmouseover=alert(11251)//` in the "Name" field
3. Save the settings
4. When the page reloads, mouse over the name to see the XSS
