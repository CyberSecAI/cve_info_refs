The XLTab â€“ Accordions and Tabs for Elementor Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.4 via the 'XLTAB_INSERT_TPL' shortcode due to insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract data from private or draft posts created by Elementor that they should not have access to.
