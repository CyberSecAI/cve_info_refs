Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The PJW Mime Config plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input and escape output when handling SVG file uploads.

**Weaknesses:**
*   Insufficient input sanitization: The plugin does not adequately clean or validate SVG file content.
*   Lack of output escaping:  The plugin does not properly encode SVG content before rendering it in a web page.

**Impact:**
*   Attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts (e.g., JavaScript) into SVG files.
*   When a user accesses the malicious SVG file, the injected scripts are executed within the user's browser.
*   This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Data theft or modification

**Attack Vector:**
*   File upload: Attackers upload a specially crafted SVG file containing malicious JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Authenticated user: Requires a user account with "Author" level access or higher.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the PJW Mime Config plugin up to and including 1.0.
*   The plugin has been closed as of November 14, 2024, due to this security issue and is not available for download from the WordPress plugin directory.
