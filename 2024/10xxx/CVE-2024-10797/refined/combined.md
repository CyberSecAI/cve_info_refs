### Description

The Full Screen Menu for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.7 via the Full Screen Menu Elementor Widget due to insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to extract data from private or draft posts created with Elementor that they should not have access to.

### [Can’t customize well](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/cant-customize-well/)

[Макс Цвет](https://profiles.wordpress.org/itdesigner/ "Posts by Макс Цвет")

I wanted make a menu like on gazprom.ru or forbes.ru with search and many columns. I have comlicated menu with 25 items. It’s useless for this. Also it’s looking not well with long items as “international cooperation”.
Also can’t use different color of “hamburger” for a different devices. I should fix it using CSS. But anyway sometimes after closing I have white hamburger on white background. Lazy to solve this.
Good sides: easy to install and use. But I uninstalling it. Only 3 for unable to customize well. sorry.
