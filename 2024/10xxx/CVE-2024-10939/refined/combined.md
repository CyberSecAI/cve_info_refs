## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Image Widget < 4.4.11 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its Image Widget settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to the Widget area
2. Add an "Image Widget"
3. Select an image for the widget and click save
4. Intercept the request and change the `imgurl` parameter to: 234"><img+src=x+onerror=alert(11245)>
5. Submit the request
6. When the page reloads, see the XSS
