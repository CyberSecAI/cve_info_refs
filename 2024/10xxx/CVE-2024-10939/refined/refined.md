- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Image Widget plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its Image Widget settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin fails to properly sanitize the `imgurl` parameter before storing it, allowing malicious JavaScript to be injected.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the widget settings. When the page is loaded, this script is executed in the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities like session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, or other actions the attacker could perform.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the widget settings, specifically by modifying the `imgurl` parameter of an Image Widget.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have high privileges such as admin access to modify widget settings.
