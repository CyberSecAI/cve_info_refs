Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10875

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the improper use of `remove_Query_Arg` function without proper output escaping on the URL. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts through URL parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a reflected XSS, where the injected script is reflected back to the user within the page's HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Web Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary web scripts in the context of the victim's browser session. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Malware injection
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Other malicious actions

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **URL Manipulation:** The primary attack vector is through manipulating the URL by injecting malicious scripts via URL parameters, leveraging the vulnerable `remove_Query_Arg` function.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers need to trick users into clicking on a specially crafted link containing the malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to rely on social engineering to trick a user into clicking on a malicious link.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know where to inject the malicious payload within the URL parameters.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerable code is located in `options-page/options-page.php` specifically on line 25.
*   The affected plugin is "Gallery Manager" with versions up to and including 1.6.58.
*   No patch is available, so the recommendation is to uninstall the plugin if possible.
*   The severity is rated as medium with a CVSS score of 6.1.
