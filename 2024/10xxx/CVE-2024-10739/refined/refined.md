Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10739

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `job-recruitment-in-php` application. Specifically, the `$person` parameter is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application fails to sanitize or parameterize user-supplied input (`$person` parameter) before using it in an SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information stored in the database, such as user credentials, personal data, or application-specific details.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a GET request to `/_parse/_feedback_system.php` with a malicious payload in the `person` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No special privileges or internal network access are required, meaning the vulnerability can be exploited remotely, assuming the application is publicly accessible.

**Technical Details:**

- The code analysis explains that the `$person` parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL statement without any restrictions. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands by manipulating the parameter value.
- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability using a simple SQL injection payload (`person=1*`).
- The `image-20250101151348839` shows how to exploit sql injection with `1*` as the `$person` parameter.

**Summary:**
The `job-recruitment-in-php` application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of input sanitization on the `$person` parameter. An attacker could exploit this to extract sensitive data from the application's database by sending specially crafted HTTP requests.
