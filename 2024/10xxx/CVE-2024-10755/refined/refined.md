Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**1. Verification:**
   - The content explicitly mentions **CVE-2024-10755** and describes an XSS vulnerability in the Online Shopping Portal 2.0, which aligns with the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from the `empty_table.php` file, specifically the way the `$aScripts[$i]` variable is handled. This variable is directly influenced by user-controlled input via the `scripts` parameter in the URL.
   - The code constructs a `<script>` tag using this user-controlled input, incorporating it directly into the `src` attribute *without any sanitization*.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS.  User-supplied data is reflected back in the HTML document without proper encoding or sanitization.
   - **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code fails to sanitize the user-provided `scripts` parameter before using it in the `<script>` tag's `src` attribute.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the page, which is then executed by the victim's browser. This allows the attacker to:
     - Steal cookies and session tokens
     - Deface the website
     - Redirect users to malicious websites
     - Perform other malicious actions on behalf of the user.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through the `scripts` parameter in the URL when requesting `empty_table.php`.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted URL to the victim (e.g., through a link or a compromised website). No authentication or special permissions are required to trigger the vulnerability.
   - **URL Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that includes the malicious javascript payload in the scripts parameter.
   
**Technical Details:**
   - **Vulnerable Code Snippet:**
     ```php
     echo '<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript" src="../'.$aScripts[$i].'?rand='.rand().'"></script>';
     ```
   - **Injection Payload:**
     ```
     %22%3E%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert('XSS')%3C/script%3E
     ```
    - **Vulnerable File Path:**
      `admin/assets/plugins/DataTables/media/unit_testing/templates/empty_table.php`

**Mitigation:**
    - **Input Sanitization:** The provided recommendation is to use `htmlspecialchars()` to encode special characters, specifically:

     ```php
        echo '<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript" src="../' . htmlspecialchars($aScripts[$i], ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8') . '?rand=' . rand() . '"></script>';
    ```
This will prevent the execution of javascript by encoding any special characters, such as `<` and `>`
