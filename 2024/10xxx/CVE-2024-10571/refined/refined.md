{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization of the 'source' parameter within the Chartify WordPress plugin. This allows an attacker to manipulate the 'source' parameter, leading to the inclusion of arbitrary local files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI). The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when including files, allowing for the inclusion of any file on the server.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary files on the server. This could lead to: \n- Bypassing access controls.\n- Obtaining sensitive data.\n- Achieving code execution by including files containing malicious PHP code.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the 'source' parameter in a GET request to the vulnerable plugin. Unauthenticated attackers can directly manipulate this parameter to specify a local file path they wish to include.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs no authentication and can trigger the vulnerability via a simple HTTP request. They do not need any special privileges or access to the server beyond the ability to send HTTP requests."
