Sometimes it crashes my account page, and after a few refreshes it works. I could live with that…
But the ad on EVERY page to buy the PRO version is too much!
Version 2.8.21 – Enhancement – Show notice about pro version.

### Description

The SysBasics Customize My Account for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘tab’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 2.7.29 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
