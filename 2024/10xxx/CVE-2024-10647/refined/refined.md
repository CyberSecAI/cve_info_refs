### Summary
The provided content describes a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the WS Form LITE WordPress plugin, specifically in versions up to and including 1.9.244.

### Root cause of vulnerability
The vulnerability stems from the plugin's use of `remove_query_arg` on a URL without proper escaping, allowing for the injection of malicious web scripts.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to sanitize user-controlled input within the URL, which is then reflected back in the page, enabling attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts.

### Impact of exploitation
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
- Execute malicious scripts in a victim's browser.
- Potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
- Redirect users to malicious websites.
- Deface or modify the content of the vulnerable page.

### Attack vectors
- **URL Manipulation:** Attackers can craft malicious URLs with injected scripts.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers must trick a user into clicking the crafted link.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to have an account or privileges on the target website.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to induce a user to click a malicious link.
