Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10028

**Vulnerable Software:** Everest Backup â€“ WordPress Cloud Backup, Migration, Restore & Cloning Plugin (versions <= 2.2.13)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The plugin creates a `PROCSTAT` file within the backup directory during the backup process. This file contains sensitive information, specifically the name of the archive file being created, and is not properly secured.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information:** The plugin stores the backup archive filename in a publicly accessible `PROCSTAT` log file within the backup directory.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The `PROCSTAT` file is not adequately protected and can be accessed by unauthenticated users.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The `PROCSTAT` file reveals the backup archive filename, allowing attackers to download the backup.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** Attackers can obtain the name of the backup archive file.
*   **Unauthorized Access to Backup Data:**  By knowing the filename, unauthenticated attackers can download the entire website backup, which may contain sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by any unauthenticated attacker with access to the website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated access:** Attackers do not need any credentials or special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network access:** Attackers must be able to reach the website hosting the vulnerable plugin.

**Additional Details:**
* The `PROCSTAT` file is meant to store process statistics, but it also logs the backup file name, which is then accessible to anyone.
* The vulnerability is located in the `inc/classes/class-backup-directory.php` file.
* The plugin attempts to protect the backup directory with security files like `.htaccess`, `sse.php`, `index.php`, and `index.html`, but the `PROCSTAT` file is still exposed.
* The `sse.php` file provides access to the contents of `PROCSTAT`.

**Remediation:**
*   Update to version 2.2.14 or later, where this vulnerability is fixed.
