PowerChute Serial Shutdown

10 December 2024

Overview

Schneider Electric is aware of a vulnerability in its PowerChute Serial Shutdown product.

The PowerChute Serial Shutdown product is a UPS management software enabling graceful system shutdown
and energy management capabilities for desktop, servers and workstations.

Failure to apply the fix provided below may risk a Denial of Service attack, which could result in an attack that
blocks access for the single user account to PCSS Web UI. The PCSS application itself is not affected and
PCSS will keep protecting the server.

Vulnerability Details

CVE ID: CVE-2024-10511

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 5.3 | Medium | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L

CVSS v4.0 Base Score 6.3 | Medium | CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N

CWE-287: Improper Authentication vulnerability exists that could cause Denial of access to the web interface
when someone on the local network repeatedly requests the /accessdenied URL.

The severity of vulnerabilities was calculated using the CVSS Base metrics for 4.0 (CVSS v4.0). CVSS v3.1
will be still evaluated until the adoption of CVSS v4.0 by the industry. The severity was calculated without
incorporating the Temporal and Environmental metrics. Schneider Electric recommends that customers score
the CVSS Environmental metrics, which are specific to end-user organizations, and consider factors such as
the presence of mitigations in that environment. Environmental metrics may refine the relative severity posed
by the vulnerabilities described in this document within a customer’s environment.

Customers should use appropriate patching methodologies when applying these patches to their systems. We
strongly recommend the use of back-ups and evaluating the impact of these patches in a Test and
Development environment or on an offline infrastructure. Contact Schneider Electric’s Customer Care Center if
you need assistance removing a patch.

If customers choose not to apply the remediation provided above, they should immediately apply the following
mitigations to reduce the risk of exploit:

•  Do not enable remote access to PCSS Web UI. In the Windows Firewall incoming requests on TCP

port 6547 (used by PCSS) are not allowed by default.

•  Harden the PowerChute Serial Shutdown Agent firewall rule by listing remote computers and/or users

for which you want to allow/block remote connections on TCP port 6547.

•  Specific instructions for these mitigations can be found in the Security Handbook.

General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.

•  Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from

•

the business network.
Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control and safety
systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.

•  Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the “Program” mode.
•  Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for that device.
•  Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB drives, etc.

before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.

•  Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the intended network to

connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.

•  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that they are not

accessible from the Internet.

•  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).
Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version
available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.
