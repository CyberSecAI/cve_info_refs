The Video Gallery for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the remove_unused_thumbnails() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.31. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete thumbnails in the video-wc-gallery-thumb directory.
