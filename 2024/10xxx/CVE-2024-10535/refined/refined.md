Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `remove_unused_thumbnails()` function in the `Video Gallery for WooCommerce` plugin lacks proper authorization checks, specifically a capability check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is the absence of a capability check within the `remove_unused_thumbnails()` function. This allows anyone, even unauthenticated users, to trigger this function.
*   **Unprotected AJAX Endpoint:** The function is accessible via an AJAX endpoint without proper permission verification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Limited File Deletion:** An attacker can delete thumbnail files stored in the `video-wc-gallery-thumb` directory. While this is limited, it can potentially disrupt the site's appearance or functionality by removing visual elements.
*   **Partial Data Manipulation:** By deleting these files, the attacker can modify the website's content in a limited manner.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated HTTP Request:** An unauthenticated attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable AJAX endpoint (`wp_ajax_remove_unused_thumbnails`)
    *   The request must include the 'action' parameter set to 'remove_unused_thumbnails' and the required security nonce and 'files_for_del' parameters, to exploit the vulnerability.
   *  The `security` parameter's value must be a valid nonce for `remove_unused_thumbnails_nonce`, and `files_for_del` value is a comma separated list of filenames to delete from the `/video-wc-gallery-thumb/` directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to have an account on the affected WordPress site.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker only needs to have network access to send requests to the site.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability is included in version 1.32 of the plugin, which involves the addition of a capability check.
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on November 5, 2024.
*   The files that were modified were in `admin-ui-setup.php`, `functions/do.php`, `includes/js/vwg-admin.js`, `readme.txt` and `video-wc-gallery.php`. The plugin also had an update of the FontAwesome Library
