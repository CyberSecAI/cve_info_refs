Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-10329:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `ube_get_page_templates` function within the "Ultimate Bootstrap Elements for Elementor" plugin. This function retrieves a list of Elementor templates, and it fails to properly check user permissions when fetching template data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access control in the `ube_get_page_templates` function. It allows users with Contributor-level access or higher to retrieve information about all Elementor templates, including those marked as private.
*  **Sensitive Information Exposure:** This vulnerability leads to the exposure of sensitive information as private templates, which might contain confidential data or design elements, can be accessed without proper authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to the content of private Elementor templates, potentially revealing sensitive information.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Malicious actors with contributor or higher level access can bypass intended access restrictions on private templates.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site with at least contributor-level privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress Account:** An attacker needs a valid account on the target WordPress site with contributor-level permissions or higher.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the WordPress site.

**Additional Notes:**
The provided code diff shows that the fix involved modifying the `ube_get_builder_content_for_display` function to include a check for the post status and user permissions before returning the template content.
