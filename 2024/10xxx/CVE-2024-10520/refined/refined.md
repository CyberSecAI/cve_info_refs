Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-10520:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content, especially the Wordfence article, directly relates to **CVE-2024-10520**. The Wordfence article states "WP Project Manager <= 2.6.14 - Missing Authorization to Project Milestone and Task Creation/Deletion", which aligns with the CVE description, as it implies a vulnerability related to missing authorization checks for creating/deleting project resources within the specified plugin version.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Missing Capability Checks:** The core issue lies in the absence of proper authorization checks within the `check` methods of the 'Create_Milestone', 'Create_Task_List', 'Create_Task' and 'Delete_Task' classes. This means that the plugin fails to verify if a user has the necessary permissions before allowing them to create milestones, create task lists, create tasks or delete tasks.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of authorization checks, allowing unauthorized users to bypass access controls.
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) (Implied):** Although not explicitly stated, the vulnerability implies an IDOR vulnerability since, without authorization checks, any user (including unauthenticated ones) could modify project data as long as they knew the relevant IDs.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Modification:** Unauthenticated attackers could create, delete tasks and task lists and create milestones in any project on a vulnerable system.
*   **Potential for Data Corruption:** The arbitrary creation/deletion could result in data corruption or disruption of project workflows.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An attacker does not need access to the server itself or to be logged into WordPress to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack would likely involve sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable plugin endpoints that handle milestone, task list and task creation or deletion.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated:** An attacker does not need to be a logged-in user of the WordPress site.
*   **Basic HTTP Request Creation:** The attacker only needs to be able to craft HTTP requests. No special privileges or specific skills beyond basic knowledge of web requests are required.
*   **Knowledge of Endpoints:** The attacker would need to know the correct plugin endpoints to send requests to, though this is often easily discoverable with open source code.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Partial Fix:** Version 2.6.14 implemented a partial fix, but it was still vulnerable. This indicates that the developers attempted to address the issue, but the fix was not complete.
*   **Complete Fix:** Version 2.6.15 fixes the authorization issues which are confirmed by the change log content.

In summary, CVE-2024-10520 in WP Project Manager stemmed from a lack of authorization checks in key functions, allowing unauthenticated attackers to create and delete milestones, tasks, and task lists. This could lead to data corruption and a disruption of project workflows. The vulnerability is network-exploitable and requires minimal attacker expertise. Version 2.6.15 fixes the authorization vulnerability.
