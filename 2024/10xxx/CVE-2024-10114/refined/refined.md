Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-10114:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient verification of the user data returned by the social login token. This lack of proper validation allows attackers to potentially bypass the authentication process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Authentication:** The plugin fails to adequately verify the identity of users logging in through social media.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Unauthenticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain access to user accounts, including administrative accounts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Takeover:** Attackers can log in as any existing user on the site.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By gaining access to administrator accounts, attackers can take complete control of the WordPress site, leading to potential data breaches, website defacement, malware injection, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is primarily **network-based (AV:N)**, meaning the attacker can exploit this remotely.
*   The attack requires a **high level of effort (AC:H)** from the attacker as they need to know the target user's email address and that the user not have an already existing account for the specific social service used to create the token.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to know the email address of a target user on the WordPress site.
*   The attacker needs to access the email that was used to create the user, in the case a token is generated from it.
*   The targeted user should not have an already-existing account with the social login service being used in the attack.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the "Social Login - WordPress / WooCommerce Plugin" up to and including 2.7.7.
*   The fix is available in version 2.7.8 where enhanced security measures are implemented for login.
* The CVSS score of 8.1 indicates a high severity of this issue.
