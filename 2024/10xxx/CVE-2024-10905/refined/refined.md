Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper access control within the IdentityIQ application. Specifically, the application allows HTTP/HTTPS access to static content located in the IdentityIQ application directory that should be protected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The core issue is that the application fails to restrict access to static content, making it accessible to unauthorized users via HTTP/HTTPS.
*  **CWE-66:** The vulnerability is classified as CWE-66 which indicates improper handling of permissions and access control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **High Confidentiality Impact:** Unauthorized access to static content could potentially expose sensitive information.
*  **High Integrity Impact:** Depending on the content exposed, it may allow an attacker to manipulate application behaviour.
*  **High Availability Impact**: If exploited it could lead to disruption of services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability via HTTP or HTTPS, meaning they can access the vulnerable content remotely over a network.
*  **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker without prior authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker only needs to be able to reach the vulnerable IdentityIQ application over the network (via HTTP/HTTPS).
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any valid user credentials for the IdentityIQ platform.

**Affected Versions:**

*   IdentityIQ 8.4 and all 8.4 patch levels prior to 8.4p2
*   IdentityIQ 8.3 and all 8.3 patch levels prior to 8.3p5
*   IdentityIQ 8.2 and all 8.2 patch levels prior to 8.2p8
*   All previous versions of IdentityIQ

**Resolution:**
* SailPoint has released e-fixes for each affected version.
* Future patch levels will include the fixes once they become available.
