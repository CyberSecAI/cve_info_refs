Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10695

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control within the `elementor-template` shortcode of the Futurio Extra plugin. This allows for unauthorized access to post content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Authorization Bypass:** The plugin fails to properly restrict access to post content based on user roles and post status (e.g., draft, private).
*   **Information Exposure:**  Authenticated users with Contributor-level access or higher can use the `elementor-template` shortcode to extract content from posts they should not have access to, such as private or draft posts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Leakage:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive information from private or draft posts, which may include confidential data, internal notes, or unreleased content.
*   **Unauthorized Content Access:** Users can view content they are not authorized to see.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Shortcode Abuse:** The `elementor-template` shortcode is the primary attack vector.
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have an account with at least Contributor-level access on the WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a registered user with a minimum of Contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
*   They need to know or be able to guess the ID of a private or draft post.
*  The attacker needs to be able to insert the vulnerable shortcode.

**Additional Details:**

*   The Wordfence article confirms the vulnerability is present in Futurio Extra plugin versions up to and including 2.0.13.
*   The fix was implemented in version 2.0.14 by adding a check to ensure that the post is published before rendering it.
*   The plugin changelog also indicates a "security update" in version 2.0.14.
*   The provided diff highlights a code change in `inc/elementor/shortcode.php` where a check was added to prevent unpublished posts from being displayed through the shortcode.

```php
if (empty($attributes['id'])) {
    return '';
}
if (get_post_status ($attributes['id']) != 'publish') {
    return '';
}
```

The fix adds a check to ensure that the post status is 'publish' before attempting to display it. If the status is not 'publish' an empty string is returned.
