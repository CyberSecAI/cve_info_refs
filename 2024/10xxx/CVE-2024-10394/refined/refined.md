- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `PSetTokens` and `PSetTokens2` pioctls in OpenAFS Unix clients do not properly limit the rate of PAG (Process Authentication Group) creation. This allows a malicious user to bypass the intended throttling mechanism by repeatedly calling these pioctls and creating new PAGs, leading to a rollover of the internal PAG id counter and allowing them to create PAGs with IDs that collide with existing ones.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Insufficient rate limiting on PAG creation via `PSetTokens` and `PSetTokens2` pioctls.
    - Lack of access controls on PAGs, allowing any user to join any PAG if they have a colliding ID.
    - Vulnerability exists because the `setpag` syscall (which does have throttling) cannot be used to change the PAG of the parent process.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local, unprivileged user can impersonate another user to AFS by joining that user's PAG, enabling them to steal, use, or set the credentials in that PAG.
- **Attack vectors:** Local, unprivileged users can exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly calling the `PSetTokens` or `PSetTokens2` pioctls.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the affected system and the ability to execute system calls or use utilities like `aklog` to trigger the vulnerable pioctls. The user also needs to be able to run processes to create PAGs. They also need to know a user is using AFS credentials in a PAG, and that is a pre-requisite for this vulnerability.
