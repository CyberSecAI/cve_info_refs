I’m familiar with EngineThemes’ excellent work. I often recommend ForumEngine to folks interested in adding a forum to
their site, it’s gorgeous, and one of the best forum solutions I’ve seen.

The layout and design is enough to give your users that WOW factor, when you dive into the features of the DirectoryEngine theme you will get everything you wish for in a great quality directory theme.

This is really exciting - I've been looking for a great Directory for WordPress ever since the SpotFinder author went on a run! All the features, but clean, proper front-end and gorgeous!

I've spent hundreds on directory themes and DirectoryEngine looks to be the most aesthetically sound theme yet.

JobEngine is the best example of what WordPress can be. Because of it’s front-end controls, you don’t actually need to use the WordPress Dashboard anymore. It has Ajax filtering, infinite scroll and a slicker than slick layout.

 ![](https://www.enginethemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/14.jpg)  Jacco Blankenspoor   Web Developer

Looks beautiful, and has very intuitive controls. Plus the badges system... it has everything! Great job EngineThemes team! You've knocked it out of the park on this theme.

I liked this theme immensely. The theme option panel is a breeze to use and the setup wizard makes it really easy to get your site up and running with ease without having to dig though loads of settings first..

ClassifiedEngine theme is well designed and comes with all the essential features that you will need to create a classified listings site with WordPress.

As said earlier QAEngine is an App Theme, which means it is developed to perform a specific task, we can easily say that the theme excels as a **fully fledged Question and Answer WordPress theme**. With all the above features, it is a theme that is highly recommended as it comes with lots of unique features, excellent support and frequent theme updates.

In my case I would like to focus on a specific city. Currently working on another great theme from you guys, JobEngine and I can say that it's pretty great!

EngineThemes Team just makes great app themes and really show what alternative uses WordPress is capable of. For those of you who don't know Quora, it's a site where people can ask questions for others (mostly experts on the topic) to answer. With this theme called QAEngine you can build a site just like that.

ForumEngine is basically a modified version of WordPress posts + comments, combined with front-end controls and easy administration. And they know how to make slick designs.

I just wanted to say thanks for the One Engine theme. This would be the first time I'm sending a thank you note, and that's because the theme is really amazing (and FREE). Thanks again for putting this out there.

We had trouble finding a user-friendly, beautiful classifieds theme over the past year. We even considered building our own from scratch. We then discovered ClassifiedEngine by EngineThemes. The theme is professional and support is wonderful.

 ![](https://www.enginethemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/5.jpg)  Sean Taylor   Web Developer

We love the JobEngine from EngineThemes, we used to have an old out dated software, which in the end no longer did the job we needed it to do. Now with JobEngine we have been very happy for the last 6 months. It's an actively developed system based off the most popular web Content Management & Blogging software WordPress, and our users love it too !

 ![](https://www.enginethemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/2.jpg)  Paul   Web Developer

With its user friendly WP dashboard and its superb design CE Classified is a recipe for success. Congratulations.

From the first glance it appeared very clean cut but primitive, but when I installed it and started testing it out I was shocked. This is by far one of the best WordPress themes I have ever seen. Good Job guys!!!! Keep it up and you will see how famous JobEngine will be!!!"

"I liked this theme immensely – it feels really nice and clean and very polished. The theme option panel is a breeze to use and the setup wizard makes it really easy to get your site up and running with ease without having to dig though loads of settings first. The population of sample data is a nice touch with allows you to visualise a finished site so you can make design changes etc. The front-end is right up my street – nice subtle stylings and a modern layout will make this pretty easy to match to your branding without too much trouble."

 ![](https://www.enginethemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/logo.gif)  WPLift   Web Developer

"Personally I love this feature as you get a real feel for what is going on with your site. Pending jobs can be viewed as if you were an actually job seeker, so you get a feel as to whether or not the job listing is right for your site, you don’t have to go digging into a post and editing via the back end, you can simply click edit, edit the job then make it live. It’s incredibly simple to do so."

### Description

The ForumEngine theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via a URL in all versions up to, and including, 1.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
