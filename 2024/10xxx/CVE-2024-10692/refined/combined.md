### Description

The PowerPack Elementor Addons (Free Widgets, Extensions and Templates) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 2.8.1 via the Content Reveal widget due to insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract data from password protected, private, or draft posts that they should not have access to.
