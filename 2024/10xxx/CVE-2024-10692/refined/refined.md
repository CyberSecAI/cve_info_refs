Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10692

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises from insufficient restrictions within the Content Reveal widget of the PowerPack Elementor Addons plugin. Specifically, the widget does not properly check the status of the posts being included, allowing access to content that should be restricted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Authorization Bypass:** The plugin fails to enforce proper authorization checks when rendering content, allowing users with contributor-level access or higher to bypass intended restrictions.
* **Information Exposure:** The vulnerability leads to the exposure of sensitive information by allowing unauthorized access to content from password-protected, private, or draft posts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Data Leakage:** Attackers can extract content from posts they shouldn't be able to access, potentially revealing confidential or sensitive information. This could include unpublished content, or private data only intended for specific users or administrators.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Network:** The attack is performed remotely via the web interface
* **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* An attacker needs a valid WordPress account with Contributor-level permissions or higher.
* The attacker needs to be able to access the WordPress instance with the vulnerable plugin installed.
* The attacker needs to utilize the affected Content Reveal widget to select the targeted protected content.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability affects all versions of the PowerPack Elementor Addons plugin up to and including 2.8.1.
* The issue is patched in version 2.8.2 by adding a check to ensure only published posts are rendered via the widget.
