Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `form_preview_shortcode` AJAX action in the Pojo Forms plugin. This action doesn't properly validate the input (specifically the 'id' parameter) before passing it to the `do_shortcode` function, which executes WordPress shortcodes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The plugin fails to sanitize or validate the `id` parameter received via the AJAX request before using it in the `do_shortcode` function.
- **Arbitrary Shortcode Execution:** The lack of proper validation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary shortcodes on the site.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can execute arbitrary shortcodes which can lead to various malicious activities such as:
  -  Inserting malicious content
  -  Redirecting users
  -  Performing actions on behalf of the site
  -  Potentially gaining access to sensitive information
- **Privilege Escalation:** Although the vulnerability requires at least subscriber access, it could be used by lower-level users to gain more control over the site's content and functionality.
- **Site Compromise:** The arbitrary code execution can lead to the complete compromise of the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is initiated through an AJAX request to the vulnerable `form_preview_shortcode` action.
- **Input:** The vulnerable input is the 'id' parameter within the AJAX request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least subscriber-level privileges.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.4.8 by using `absint()` function to validate the id.
- The vulnerable code is in the `classes/class-pojo-forms-ajax.php` file
- The plugin was closed as of December 15, 2024, and is not available for download.
