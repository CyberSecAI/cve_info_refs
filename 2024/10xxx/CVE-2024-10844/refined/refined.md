- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The 'search.php' file in the 'Bookstore Management System PHP MySQL Project' does not properly sanitize user input from the `s` parameter, leading to SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability in the `search.php` file due to insufficient user input validation of the `s` parameter. The vulnerability is susceptible to boolean-based blind, time-based blind, and UNION query SQL injection techniques.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can gain unauthorized database access, leading to sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and service interruption.
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating the `s` parameter in the `search.php` file's URL, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code. No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `search.php` endpoint and manipulate the `s` parameter. No special privileges or authorization is required.
