Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `ajax_save_fields()` function within the WordPress User Extra Fields plugin. This lack of verification allows unauthorized users to manipulate user data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The primary issue is the absence of proper capability checks on the `ajax_save_fields()` function. This means that the function can be accessed and executed by users who should not have the required permissions.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting the missing authorization, a user with low-level privileges can add custom fields that can be updated, and subsequently use the `check_and_overwrite_wp_or_woocommerce_fields` function to modify their `wp_capabilities` field, granting themselves administrator privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can elevate their user role to administrator, granting them full control over the WordPress site.
- **Full Site Control:** With admin privileges, the attacker can modify site content, install malicious plugins/themes, access sensitive data, and potentially compromise the entire server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network.
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Existing WordPress Account:** The attacker needs an active account on the vulnerable WordPress site, with a minimum role of subscriber.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Function:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable function `ajax_save_fields()`.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable plugin is "WordPress User Extra Fields" up to version 16.6.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 16.7.
- The plugin is also listed on CodeCanyon.
