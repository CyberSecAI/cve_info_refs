## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Sticky Social Icons <= 1.2.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to Sticky Social Icons settings.
2. Go to the Icons section
3. Select any icon and go to the Selected Icons option
4. In the Icon parameter, enter the XSS payload in the URL field and then save it: http://123.123"onmouseover='alert(1)'

### Affects Plugins

CleanTalk is a Cloud security service that protects your website from online threats and provides you great security instruments to control your website security. We provide detailed security stats for all of our security features to have a full control of security. All security logs are stored in the cloud for 45 days.

Security FireWall by CleanTalk is a free plugin which works with the premium Cloud security service cleantalk.org. This security plugin as a service https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software\_as\_a\_service.

Malware always becomes a headache for site owners. If you don’t regularly check for malware, it will be able to work insensibly a lot of time and damage your reputation. If you prevent malware attacks before they happen, you will be able to save your resources.

What is malware and why does it matter to your business? Malware is malicious code that performs actions for hackers. If your site has been infected with malware it will be able a problem for customer trust and their personal details. First, you need to scan your site to confirm the malware exists. The next step you should fix all files with malware.

#### Limit Login Attempts

Limit Login Attempts – is a part of brute-force protection and security firewall.

Security Firewall has a limit for requests to your website (by default 1000 requests per hour, so you can change it) and if any IP exceed this threshold it will be added to security firewall for next 24 hours. It allows you to break some of the DDoS attacks.

#### Brute Force Protection

It adds a few seconds delay for any failed attempt to login to WordPress admin area. WordPress Security & Firewall by CleanTalk makes access to your website more secure. Service will check your security log once per hour and if some IP’s have 10 and more attempts to log in per hour, then these IP’s will be banned for next 24 hours.

*Security Audit Log* keeps track of actions in the WP Dashboard to let you know what is happening on your blog.

With the Security Audit Log is very easy to see user activity in order to understand what changes have done and who made them.

Security Audit Log shows who logged in and when and how much time they spent on each page.

#### Security Traffic Control

CleanTalk security Traffic Control will track every single visitor no matter if they are using JavaScript or not and provides many valuable traffic parameters.

Another option in Security Traffic Control – “Block user after requests amounts more than” – blocks access to the site for any IP that has exceeded the number of HTTP requests per hour. If this number of requests will be exceeded, this IP will be added to the Security FireWall Black List for 24 hours.

#### Security Firewall

To enhance the security of your site, you can use the CleanTalk Security FireWall, which will allow you to block access by HTTP/HTTPS to your website for individual IP addresses, IP networks and block access to users from specific countries. Use personal BlackList to block IP addresses with a suspicious activity to enhance the WordPress security.

Security FireWall may significantly reduce the risk of hacking and reduces the load on your web server.

CleanTalk Security is fully compatible with the most popular VPN services.

Also, CleanTalk security supports all search engines Google, Bing, Yahoo, Baidu, MSN, Yandex and etc.

#### Security Malware Scanner

Scans WordPress files for hacker files or code for hacker code.

Security Malware Scanner runs manually in the settings. All of the results will send in your Security CleanTalk Dashboard with the details and you will be able to investigate them and see if that was a legitimate change or some bad code was injected.

CleanTalk Antivirus protects your website from viruses and deletes infected code from files. Antivirus scans not only WP core, it will check all of the files on your WordPress. Heuristics antivirus scan allows finding malware/viruses code by bad php constructions.

CleanTalk Security has a “Feedback System” for analyzing suspicious files. This is the client-server feature in CleanTalk Security that allows sending suspicious files from the WordPress backend to CleanTalk cloud.

Security Malware Scanner shows a list of suspicious files and you can view code that was indicated as bad. If you don’t have programming experience and don’t know, is there security issue or not, you will be able to send some files to CleanTalk and we will check them for malware code. After checking we will send you an email notification with results, is there viruses or not.

Every day, CleanTalk Security Malware Scanner will check new files and files that have been changed from the last scanning.

Please, look at our guide How malware file analysis works.

[About Scanner Feedback System](https://cleantalk.org/help/files-analysis "About Scanner Feedback System")

#### Security Malware Heuristic Check

This option allows you to check files of plugins and themes with heuristic analysis. Probably it will find more than you expect.

#### Security Malware scanner to find SQL Injections

The CleanTalk Security Malware Scanner allows you to find code that allows performing SQL injection. It is this problem that the scanner solves.

#### Scanner of known vulnerabilities

Plugin checks installed plugins and themes for known (published) vulnerabilities. If finds vulnerable plugin/theme, it sends an Email notification and shows data in the WordPress Dashboard.

#### Web Application FireWall (WAF) for WordPress Security Plugin

The main purpose of Web Application FireWall (WAF) is real-time protection from unauthorized access, even if there are critical known/unknown vulnerabilities.

Security Web Application FireWall catches all requests to your website and checks HTTP parameters that include: SQL Injection, Cross Site Scripting (XSS), uploading files from non-authorised users, PHP constructions/code, the presence of malicious code in the downloaded files.

In addition to effective information security and information security applications are required to know what is quality of protection and CleanTalk Security has logged all blocked requests that allow you to know and analyze accurate information. You can see your Cleantalk Security Logs in your Control panel. https://cleantalk.org/my/logs\_firewall

CleanTalk’s research team updates WAF database each time as we find a vulnerability, it means plugin’s users get protection even against unpublished vulnurebilites.

[About Security Web Application Firewall](https://cleantalk.org/help/security-waf "About Web Application Firewall")

#### Improve your website security with Two Factor Authentication

It requires a bit of your time but Two Factor (2 Step) Authentication immediately gives a much higher level of security.

With your first authorization, the CleanTalk Security plugin remembers your browser and you won’t have to input your authorization code every time anymore. However, if you started to use a new device or a new browser then you are required to input your security authorization code. CleanTalk security plugin will remember your browser for 30 days.

#### Change the URL of the wp-login page

This option helps you change the default wp-login URL. Hackers use scripts for massive brute-force attacks, and since most sites use a default login page URL, hackers configure scripts for such URLs. When you change the URL of the authorization page, hackers will not have the opportunity to perform brute-force attacks in scripts in automatic mode.

To enable the option, go to the WP Dashboard plugin settings -> Settings -> Security by CleanTalk -> General Settings and check box Change address to login script. Then add a new URL and click Save Settings.

This option does not change files and does not rewrite URLs in system files. To return the address of the default authorization page, it is enough to disable the option in the plugin settings or set a new value.

If you are using caching plugins, then you need to add a new authorization page in the caching exceptions.

#### Can I use CleanTalk Security and Wordfence together

Sure, you can use CleanTalk Security and Wordfence. Quite often we get question from our customers, will there be a conflict between CleanTalk and Wordfence? We tested CleanTalk Security and Wordfence working together and they work without any conflicts.

#### Email Notifications when administrators are logged in

We added this option to our security plugin. Now you can receive notifications if you want to know about an unauthorized entrance to your WP Dashboard.

Notification will be sent only when a user was able to authorize entering login and password. If you are logged into the admin panel from the saved session, then the alert won’t be sent.

You can enable the option “Receive notifications for admin authorizations in your CleanTalk Dashboard. Choose “Site Security” in the “Services” menu, then click “Settings”.

#### Can CleanTalk Security protect from DDoS?

Security FireWall can mitigate HTTP/HTTPS DDoS attacks. When an intruder makes GET requests to attack your website, Security FireWall blocks all requests from bad IP addresses. If your website under DDoS attack you will be able to add IPs to your personal BlackList to block all Post and GET requests.

#### `Send additional HTTP headers` option

There are several additional http-headers which added to the every http-requests by the plugin if this option is enabled:

– “X-Content-Type-Options” improves the security of your site (and your users) against some types of drive-by-downloads.

– “X-XSS-Protection” header improves the security of your site against some types of XSS (cross-site scripting) attacks.

– “Strict-Transport-Security” response header (often abbreviated as HSTS) informs browsers that the site should only be accessed using HTTPS, and that any future attempts to access it using HTTP should automatically be converted to HTTPS.

– “Referrer-Policy” make the `Referer` http-header transferring more strictly.

#### File System Watcher feature

File system Watcher monitors changes in the file system. This allows to quickly respond to a site infection by tracking which files were affected. The Watcher makes file system snapshots as often as one hour and show difference up to seven days time frame.

## FAQ

### Why are they attacking me?

Hackers want to get access to your website and use it to get backlinks from your site to improve their site’s PageRank or redirect your visitors to malicious sites or use your website to send spam and viruses or other attacks.These attacks can damage your reputation with readers and commentators if you fail to tackle it.

  + Then go to your Security Log.

You have the following possibilities:

* Time period for all records you want to see.
* Website for which you want to see security records. Leave the field empty to see security records for all websites.

Choose an event you want to see:

* Authorization Login — all successful logins to your website.
* Authorization Logout — all closed sessions.
* Authorization Invalid username — login attempts with not existing username.
* Authorization Auth failed — wrong password login attempts.

Audit View — records of actions and events of users in your website backend.

* Searching records by IP address.
* Searching records by username.
* Searching records by country.

List of records. Each record has the following columns:

* Date — when the event happened.
* User Log — who performed actions.
* Event — what did he do.
* Status — was he Passed or Banned.
* IP — his IP address.
* Country — what country that IP belongs to.
* Details — some details if they are available.

Please, read more

https://cleantalk.org/help/Security-Log

If you wish to block some countries from visiting your website, please, use this instruction: https://cleantalk.org/help/Security-Firewall

### How to use Security Firewall

First go to your Security Dashboard. Choose “Site Security” in the “Services” menu. Then press the line “Black&White Lists” under the name of your website.

You can add records of different types to your black list or white list:

* IP-Addresses (For example 10.150.20.250, 10.10.10.10)
* Subnets (For example 10.150.20.250/24, 10.10.10.10/8)
* Countries. Click the line “Add a country” to blacklist or whitelist all IP-addresses of the chosen countries.

The records can be added one by one or all at once using separators: comma, semicolon, space, tab or new line. After filling the field press the button “Whitelist” or “Blacklist”. All added records will be displayed in your list below. Please note, all changes will be applied in 5-10 minutes.

Please, read full instruction here

https://cleantalk.org/help/Security-Firewall

### How to test Security Firewall?

1. Open another browser or enter the incognito mode.
2. Type address YOUR\_WEBSITE/?security\_test\_ip=ANY\_IP\_FROM\_BLACK\_LIST

   2.1 Address 10.10.10.10 is local address and it’s in blacklist constantly. So address YOUR\_WEBSITE/?security\_test\_ip=10.10.10.10 will works everytime.
3. Make sure that you saw page with the blocking message.
4. FireWall works properly, if it is not, see item 4 of the list.

### How does malware scanner work?

Malware scanner will check and compare with the original WP files and show you what files were changed, deleted or added. Malware scanner could be used to find an added code in WP files. On your Malware Security Log page, you will see the list of all scans that were performed for your website. The CleanTalk Cloud saves the list of the found files for you to know where to look them for.

### How to start malware scanner?

At the moment malware scanner may be started one time per day and manually.

To start malware scanner go to the WordPress Admin Page —> Settings —> Security by CleanTalk —> “Malware Scanner” tab —> Perform Scan.

Give the Malware Scanner some time to check all necessary files on your website.

### Is it free or paid?

The plugin is free. But the plugin uses CleanTalk cloud security service. You have to register an account and then you will receive a free trial to test. When the trial (on CleanTalk account) is finished, you can renew the subscription for 1 year or deactivate the Security by CleanTalk plugin.

If you haven’t got access key, the plugin will work and you will have logs only on the plugin settings page for last 20 requests.

### What happens after the end of the trial period?

The plugin will fully perform its functions after the end of the trial period and will protect your website from brute force attacks and will keep Action Log in your WP Dashboard, but the number of entries in the log will be limited to the last 20 entries/24 hours. Also, you will receive a short daily security report to your email.

Premium version allows to storage all logs for 45 days in the CleanTalk Dashboard for further analysis.

### Brute Force security for WordPress

Brute force attack is an exhaustive password search to get full access to an Administrator account. Passwords are not the hard part for hackers taking into account the quantity of sent password variants per second and the big amount of IP-addresses.

Brute force attack is one of the most security issues as an intruder gets full access to your website and can change your code. Consequences of these break-ins might be grievous, your website could be added to the [botnet] and it could participate in attacks to other websites, it could be used to keep hidden links or automatic redirection to a suspicious website. Consequences for your website reputation might be very grievous.

### Why is the CleanTalk Security Plugin Added to the Must Use Section?

This is required for the Security FireWall to function properly. Plugins that are placed in this section are being launched first, so it is very important that the Security FireWall is launched before any plugins and hooks. Thus, hacker requests will be stopped before they can get access to any site code.

## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Sticky Social Icons <= 1.2.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to Sticky Social Icons settings.
2. Go to the Icons section
3. Select any icon and go to the Selected Icons option
4. In the Icon parameter, enter the XSS payload in the URL field and then save it: http://123.123"onmouseover='alert(1)'

### Affects Plugins

# Effective Prevention Methods for XSS

You are here: [Home](https://research.cleantalk.org/) » Effective Prevention Methods for XSS

**Cross-site scripting (XSS)** vulnerabilities occupy one of the first places in terms of frequency among the vulnerabilities found in WordPress plugins. These vulnerabilities occur when data from a user is not sufficiently cleaned before being displayed on site pages, which allows attackers to inject malicious code such as JavaScript and execute it in visitors’ browsers. XSS attacks can lead to theft of user data, hijacking of sessions, modification of page content, and other types of malicious activity.
The problem of cross-site scripting is especially relevant for WordPress, where the use of third-party plugins is widespread. Each plugin represents an additional potential attack vector, and many developers face difficulties in ensuring an adequate level of data I/O security. Insufficient protection and clearing of parameters can lead to reflected or stored XSS attacks, which threatens the security of users and the reputation of the website.

**Types of Cross-Site Scripting attacks and protection methods**There are several types of Cross-Site Scripting attacks, the most common are **Stored XSS** and **Reflected XSS**

## **Stored XSS**

With **Stored XSS**, malicious code is stored on the server, for example, in a database, and is displayed to every user who opens a page with this content. This is especially dangerous because the code is executed automatically when the page is viewed.
Let’s look at examples of **Vulnerable code:**

```
if ( isset( $_POST['comment'] ) ) {

    $comment = $_POST['comment'];

    $wpdb->insert( 'wp_comments', array( 'comment_content' => $comment ) );

}

$comments = $wpdb->get_results( "SELECT comment_content FROM wp_comments" );

foreach ( $comments as $comment ) {

    echo $comment->comment_content;

}
```

If an attacker adds a comment **<script>alert(‘XSS’)</script>**, then this code will be saved in the database and executed every time the page with comments is loaded.

**Fixed code:**

```
if ( isset( $_POST['comment'] ) ) {

    $comment = sanitize_text_field( $_POST['comment'] );

    $wpdb->insert( 'wp_comments', array( 'comment_content' => $comment ) );

}

$comments = $wpdb->get_results( "SELECT comment_content FROM wp_comments" );

foreach ( $comments as $comment ) {

    echo esc_html( $comment->comment_content );

}
```

The **esc\_html()** function is used to safely output the contents of each comment in the browser by escaping any HTML objects. In particular, the esc\_html() function converts characters such as **<, >** and & to their **HTML equivalents (<lt;, &gt; and &amp;)**. This prevents the execution of any embedded HTML or JavaScript code, which is crucial to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Let’s take the example of the vulnerability CVE-2024–9021**(link:<https://research.cleantalk.org/cve-2024-9021/>)**:**

The plugin is vulnerable to cross-site scripting via the user name field in all versions up to and including 4.23.0 due to insufficient cleaning of input data and escaping of output data. This allows unauthorized attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages that will be executed every time a user visits the embedded page.

The vulnerability was found in Custom Fields for the user, where an XSS payload can be saved. As a result of insufficient filtration, the payload was being processed.

The vulnerable line in the plugin initially looked like this:

![](https://research.cleantalk.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/XSS_research_1.png)

The values from the **$custom\_fields** array are combined into a delimited string and returned without additional processing. If**$custom\_fields** contains data entered by the user, this can lead to XSS, since the code can be output to HTML directly.

```
Fixed code: return htmlspecialchars( implode( ', ', $custom_fields ) );
```

The **htmlspecialchars()** function processes the implode() result by converting special characters such as **<, >,** &, and ” into HTML entities (**<lt;, &gt;, &amp;,** and &quot; respectively). This allows the data to be displayed safely, since the browser treats special characters as text, and not as HTML tags or JavaScript code.

## **Reflected XSS**

**Reflected XSS (Reflected Cross-site Scripting)** is a type of vulnerability in which a malicious script is embedded in a web page and immediately executed in the user’s browser. This vulnerability occurs when data provided by a user is returned in a web server response without proper verification and screening.

In WordPress, this can happen, for example, when user input (such as URL parameters, form fields, or cookies) is displayed on a web page without proper processing. A malicious script transmitted through such data can be executed in the user’s browser if they visit a page containing this input.

In WordPress, this can happen, for example, when user input (such as URL parameters, form fields, or cookies) is displayed on a web page without proper processing. A malicious script transmitted through such data can be executed in the user’s browser if they visit a page containing this input.

**Vulnerable code:**

```
if ( isset( $_GET['search'] ) ) {
    $search_query = $_GET['search'];
    echo "You searched for: " . $search_query;
}
```

An attacker can pass malicious code in the **search URL paramete**r, for example:

```
https://example.com/?search=<script>alert('XSS')</script>
```

This code will be executed in the browser if it is displayed on the page, since the data from **$\_GET[‘search’]** is not escaped before output.

```
if ( isset( $_GET['search'] ) ) {
    $search_query = htmlspecialchars( $_GET['search'], ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8' );
    echo " You searched for: " . $search_query;
}
```

**The second example of vulnerable code:**

```
if ( isset( $_GET['username'] ) ) {
    $username = $_GET['username'];
    echo '';
}
```

An attacker can use the following payload:

```
https://example.com/?username="; onfocus="alert('XSS')
```

This will result in JavaScript execution, and the input field gets focus, due to the fact that the raw value will be displayed directly in the value attribute.

Fixed code using the **esc\_attr()** function:

```
if ( isset( $_GET['username'] ) ) {
    $username = $_GET['username'];
    echo '';
}
```

The **esc\_attr()** function escapes special characters in HTML attributes (for example, “and =”), preventing the execution of malicious code entered using attributes.

**Using the example of vulnerability CVE-2024–7313(<https://research.cleantalk.org/cve-2024-7313/> ) :**A Reflected XSS vulnerability was discovered on one of the plugins in the URL field of the **nav\_sub** parameter.![](https://research.cleantalk.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/XSS_research_2.png)

The values of **$nav** and **$subNav** are directly extracted from the $this->action\_data array and assigned without any cleanup. Constants::NAV\_SUB\_ID were obtained from user input (for example, from a GET request), an attacker could have passed malicious JavaScript code there.

**Fixed code:**

![](https://research.cleantalk.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/XSS_research_3.png)

In this version of the code, the **sanitize\_key()** function has been added when assigning values to **$nav** and**$subNav**. This function clears the string, leaving only safe characters (letters, numbers, underscores and hyphens), which prevents the introduction of malicious code in the parameters.

The **sanitize\_key()** function is useful for protection against injections and XSS attacks, because:

1. Removes potentially dangerous characters, such as **<, >,** ;, which may be part of JavaScript or HTML code.
2. It is used for variables that can then be used in an HTML context: Clearing protects against code execution when transferring data between functions.

It is important to remember that**sanitize\_key()** is intended for preparing strings as keys and is not suitable for sanitizing values ​​that will be output to HTML, as it may only remove certain characters while leaving some other potentially dangerous values.

## **Protective functions:**

WordPress has several built-in features to protect against **XSS** attacks, which help to safely process and output user data.

## 1.**Esc\_html()**

This function is used to escape the data that will be output in the body of the HTML document. It prevents malicious scripts from executing by converting special characters into their HTML entities (for example, <becomes <lt;,> ->).

**Example:**

If user input is to be displayed on the page, for example, in the search field

```
if ( isset( $_GET['search'] ) ) {
    $search_query = $_GET['search'];
    echo "You searched for: " . esc_html( $search_query );
}
```
## **2. Esc\_Attr()**

It is used to escape data that will be inserted into HTML attributes (for example, the value of the href, src, value attribute, etc.). Escapes special characters such as quotes and angle brackets that can be used for JavaScript injections.

```
echo '<input type="text" value="' . esc_attr( $user_input ) . '".';
```

If the user enters data that should be inserted into the HTML attributes:

```
<input type="text" value="<?php echo esc_attr( $user_input ); ?>" />
```
## **3. ESC\_JS()**

The function escapes the data that will be inserted into JavaScript. It safely handles characters such as quotes, spaces, newlines, and others that may cause an error or be used for JavaScript injections.

**Example:**

```
echo '<script>console.log("Message: ' . esc_js( $user_input ) . '");</script>';
```

If the user’s data is passed to JavaScript, then you need to **use the function**:

```
<script> var userMessage = "<?php echo esc_js( $user_input ); ?>"; </script>
```
## **4. SANITIZE\_TEXT\_FIELD()**

The main protection mechanism is to prevent the possibility of entering or displaying JavaScript code on web pages. When a user enters data into forms such as username, comments, or text fields, this value can be displayed on the screen without proper cleaning. If the data is not cleared, an attacker can insert malicious code that will be executed in another user’s browser (XSS attack). The **sanitize\_text\_field()** function helps eliminate such threats by removing tags and suspicious characters.

Using:

```
$clean_text = sanitize_text_field( $_GET['user_input'] );
```

Example:

```
if (isset($_GET['user_input'])) {
    $clean_input = sanitize_text_field($_GET['user_input']);
    echo "User input: " . $clean_input;
}
```
## **5. SANITIZE\_KEY()**

The function removes or escapes characters that can be used to perform attacks such as injections or other vulnerabilities. This includes:

**Spaces.**
**Characters that are not within the acceptable range for keys, for example, characters used for injection or URL manipulation.**

The function only allows characters that are safe to use in URLs, option names, hook names, or other keys. This is usually:

Letters (a-z, A-Z).
Numbers (0-9).
Underscores and dashes (for example, my\_key, my-key).

```
if (isset($_GET['nav'])) {
    $nav = sanitize_key($_GET['nav']);
    echo "Selected nav: " . $nav;
}
```
## **6. SANITIZE\_EMAIL()**

The function removes all characters that are not part of the standard email address format, such as spaces, tabs, and other characters that are not allowed in email addresses according to the RFC standard. It is also important that the email address is structurally valid. sanitize\_email() uses regular expressions to check and clear the string. For example, it checks that the email address contains the @ symbol and the domain, and removes all unnecessary characters, such as additional spaces or forbidden characters. Clearing email addresses helps prevent malicious scripts from being embedded in a database or on pages.

**Example:**

```
if (isset($_POST['submit'])) {
    $user_email = $_POST['user_email'];
    $clean_email = sanitize_email($user_email);

    if (is_email($clean_email)) {
        update_option('user_email', $clean_email);
        echo "Your email has been successfully updated.";
    } else {
        echo "The email address you entered is not valid. Please try again.";
    }
}
```
## **7. WP\_KSES()**

**wp\_kses()** is a function in WordPress used to filter HTML content and prevent potentially harmful or unsafe HTML elements and attributes from being added to posts, comments, or other types of user input. This is one of the main functions designed to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

The main purpose of wp\_kses() is to allow access only to a secure subset of HTML elements and attributes, while removing any potentially malicious code or elements that could lead to XSS vulnerabilities. When a user submits input data (for example, a comment, the content of a post, or a custom form) containing HTML, the wp\_kses() function ensures that only the allowed HTML tags and attributes remain, and the rest will be deleted.

This is especially important if you want to store user-generated content in the database, such as blog posts or comments, while maintaining certain HTML formatting (such as links, images, or paragraphs) without the risk of running malicious scripts. By default, **wp\_kses()** allows a set of safe HTML tags (like <a>, <b>, <p>, <img>, etc.) and certain attributes (like href, src, alt, etc.) for those tags. You can customize this list by providing a custom set of allowed tags and attributes. Any HTML tags, JavaScript code, event attributes (like onclick, onmouseover), or other potentially dangerous content (such as <script> or <style>) are removed. This ensures that any script injected by the user will not be executed when the content is viewed by others.

**Example:**

```
function wp_kses($content, $allowed_html) {
    $allowed_tags = array_keys($allowed_html);
    $content = strip_tags($content, '<' . implode('><', $allowed_tags) . '>');
    return $content;
}

$content = '<p>This is <b>safe</b> content <script>alert("XSS")</script></p>';
$allowed_html = array(
    "p" => array(),
    "b" => array()
);

$clean_content = wp_kses($content, $allowed_html);
echo $clean_content;

```

The output will be: **<p>This is <b>safe</b> content </p>**

## **Conclusion**

Following the basic recommendations outlined on this page, you will be able to minimize the risks of introducing the most common vulnerabilities into the code. The main focus should be on checking the input data, cleaning the output data and escaping, which will significantly strengthen the security of your application. When choosing cleaning and screening methods, it is important to focus on the most appropriate one for your particular case.

If you output data to HTML attributes, use special cleaning or escaping functions designed to work with HTML attributes. This will ensure a balance between performance and security. Proper protection against XSS vulnerabilities and correct processing of output data will help to avoid many potential threats in your application.

The plugin is easy to use and works properly, but it would be great if it supported “viber:” as a URL prefix.

Robo Gallery, a popular WordPress plugin used for displaying photo galleries and sliders, contains a critical vulnerability, CVE-2024-10102. This flaw allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin’s settings via a simple stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack. The vulnerability can be exploited by users with contributor privileges, enabling them to create a backdoor in the WordPress admin area. This backdoor can then be used to hijack admin accounts, potentially gaining full control of the website. With over 50,000 active installations, this vulnerability poses a significant risk to sites using Robo Gallery.

WP Customer Area is a versatile and modular WordPress plugin designed to provide a private content management solution. With features like sharing files and pages with specific users or groups, it has become a preferred choice for managing confidential content in WordPress websites. However, in version 8.2.4 and earlier, a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability was discovered, which allows unauthorized users to delete event logs without proper authentication.

This vulnerability poses a significant risk, as logs often contain critical records of user actions and system events. Attackers exploiting this vulnerability could erase these logs, effectively covering their tracks and compromising a site’s ability to identify malicious activities. Notably, the plugin is now discontinued, emphasizing the importance of transitioning to alternative solutions.

# CVE-2024-11183 – Simple Side Tab – Stored XSS to Backdoor Creation – POC

You are here: [Home](https://research.cleantalk.org/) » CVE-2024-11183 – Simple Side Tab – Stored XSS to Backdoor Creation – POC

It was recently discovered that the **“Simple Slide Tab”** plugin, designed to help WordPress site owners increase conversion by adding customizable call-to-action tabs, contains a security flaw. The simplicity and convenience of the plugin, combined with its flexibility in customizing tab behavior and appearance, have made it practical among WordPress users. However, this popularity now poses a security threat due to a vulnerability related to the saved **cross-site scripts (XSS) CVE-2024-11183**. This flaw can be used to create backdoors that provide attackers with unauthorized access to vulnerable sites.

| November 19, 2024 | Registered **CVE-2024-11183** |

## **Discovery of the Vulnerability**

During a routine security audit, researchers identified a stored **XSS vulnerability** in the **“Simple Side Tab”** plugin. The issue lies within the “Position from top (px)” parameter (`rum_sst_plugin_options[pixels_from_top]`) in the plugin’s settings. This parameter allows users to set the vertical position of the tab on the page. However, improper input validation and output encoding make it possible for attackers to inject malicious JavaScript payloads into this field.

## **Understanding of XSS attack’s**

The **“Simple Side Tab”** vulnerability is a textbook example of this flaw. The “Position from top” setting allows administrators to input custom values, but the lack of sanitization means that malicious payloads can be saved and executed. Once stored, the script executes whenever the affected setting is loaded, posing risks such as session hijacking, credential theft, or even the deployment of backdoors.

## **Exploiting the ********XSS******** Vulnerability**

Exploiting this vulnerability requires minimal effort and can be achieved in a few simple steps:

> **POC**:
>
> 1. Access the WordPress admin dashboard and navigate to the “Simple Side Tab” plugin settings.
> 2. Locate the “Position from top (px)” parameter in the settings.
> 3. Select an icon and modify the “Selected Icons” option.
> 4. Input a malicious payload into the URL field.
> 5. Input a malicious payload, such as:
>
> ```
> 123123”onmouseover=’alert(1)’
> ```
>
> 6. Save the settings.
>
> \_\_\_\_

Once the payload is saved, the XSS is triggered when interacting with the vulnerable field. In the hands of an attacker, this initial exploitation could be leveraged to inject further malicious code, steal session cookies, or plant a backdoor for persistent access.

## ****Recommendations for Improved Security****

To reduce the risks associated with **CVE-2024-11183**, it is important for WordPress administrators to update the Simple Side Tab plugin, since the vulnerability has not been fixed. Administrators should also check user permissions to ensure that non-administrator users (such as editors) do not have access to sensitive settings that could lead to XSS vulnerabilities. The plugin must process all user input, especially in the form verification fields, to prevent the introduction of malicious scripts. In addition, administrators should limit the ability to use unfiltered\_html for users who are not trusted, and use security plugins to search for vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins and themes. Implementing a **Content Security Policy (CSP)** can also help mitigate the effects of any successful XSS attacks by blocking the execution of unreliable scripts. To prevent this type of attack, the vendor used [our prevention methods](https://research.cleantalk.org/effective-methods-for-xss-protection/).

> By taking proactive measures to address **Stored XSS vulnerabilities like CVE-2024-11183**, WordPress website owners can enhance their security posture and safeguard against potential exploitation. Stay vigilant, stay secure.

| November 15, 2024 | Registered **CVE-2024-10551** |

## **Discovery of the Vulnerability**

The vulnerability in the “**Sticky Social Icons**” plugin was uncovered during a routine security assessment. Researchers identified that the plugin’s configuration settings failed to properly sanitize user inputs. Specifically, the URL field in the Icon parameter was vulnerable to malicious payloads. This oversight opened the door for attackers to inject JavaScript code, which would execute whenever the affected icon was interacted with.

## **Understanding of XSS attack’s**

**Stored XSS vulnerabilities** occur when malicious scripts are injected into a target system and saved permanently. In WordPress, such flaws often arise due to inadequate input validation or output encoding in plugin or theme code.

## **Exploiting the ********XSS******** Vulnerability**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need access to the WordPress admin panel, either through brute-forcing credentials or leveraging another vulnerability. Once logged in, the attacker would:

> **POC**:
>
> 1. Navigate to the “Sticky Social Icons” settings.
> 2. Go to the “Icons” section.
> 3. Select an icon and modify the “Selected Icons” option.
> 4. Input a malicious payload into the URL field.
> 5. Save the changes.
>
> For example, in this case, a payload like:
>
> ```
> PoC: http://123.123"onmouseover='alert(1)'
> ```
>
> \_\_\_\_

could be inserted into the URL field of an icon, allowing the script to execute when a user interacts with the icon. This seemingly innocuous behavior can escalate into a full-scale attack, where the injected script is used to steal cookies, capture credentials, or create a backdoor for persistent access.

## ****Recommendations for Improved Security****

To reduce the risks associated with CVE-2024-10551, it is important for WordPress administrators not to use the Sticky Social Icons plugin as the vulnerability has not been fixed. Administrators should also check user permissions to ensure that non-administrator users (such as editors) do not have access to sensitive settings that could lead to XSS vulnerabilities. The plugin must process all user input, especially in the form verification fields, to prevent the introduction of malicious scripts. In addition, administrators should limit the ability to use unfiltered\_html for users who are not trusted, and use security plugins to search for vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins and themes. Implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP) can also help mitigate the effects of any successful XSS attacks by blocking the execution of unreliable scenarios.
