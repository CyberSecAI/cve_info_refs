Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10453

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied attributes within the Typography settings of the Elementor Website Builder plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the typography settings, allowing malicious scripts to be stored in the database. These scripts are executed when a user views the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a page. This script can then be executed by any user visiting that page.
- **Account Takeover:** If the malicious script targets administrator accounts, it can be used to take over control of the site.
- **Malware Distribution:** The malicious script can redirect users to malicious websites, potentially leading to malware infections.
- **Data Theft:** The injected JavaScript can be used to steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive data from users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Typography Settings:** The vulnerability exists within the typography settings of the Elementor Website Builder plugin, where user input is not properly sanitized.
- **Web Pages:** The malicious script is injected into web pages via the typography settings.
- **Network:** The attacker must be able to communicate with the WordPress site, either directly or through an intermediary.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level access (or above) to the WordPress site. This is enough permission to modify settings.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the specific vulnerability in the typography settings of the affected Elementor plugin versions.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all Elementor Website Builder plugin versions up to and including 3.25.9.
- The vulnerability has been patched in version 3.25.10.
