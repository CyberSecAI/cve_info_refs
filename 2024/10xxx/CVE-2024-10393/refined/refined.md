Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-10393:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing check for the 'users\_can\_register' option within the `register_instructor` function of the Tutor LMS plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized User Registration:** Unauthenticated attackers can register as the default user role on the site, even when registration is disabled in WordPress settings. This could allow attackers to gain a foothold on the site and potentially cause further harm, depending on the permissions of the default role.

- The attacker does not require user interaction (UI:N)

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is present in Tutor LMS versions up to and including 2.7.6.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.7.7 by adding a check for `get_option( 'users_can_register', false )` before allowing registration.
