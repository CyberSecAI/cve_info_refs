Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the `Simple Shortcode for Google Maps` WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin's `pw_map` shortcode does not properly handle user-supplied attributes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS due to the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of user-provided attributes within the shortcode. This allows malicious scripts to be stored in the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
*   **User Compromise:** When a user accesses a page containing the injected malicious script, the script executes within their browser. This can lead to session hijacking, credential theft, or other malicious actions, effectively compromising users who view the affected pages.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Injection:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code through the attributes of the `pw_map` shortcode. For example: `[pw_map address="New York City" key="YOUR API KEY"  onload="alert('XSS')" ]`
*   **Stored XSS:** The injected script is stored in the WordPress database and is rendered whenever the affected page is viewed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with at least "contributor" level access. This level of access is required to create or edit content where the malicious shortcode can be inserted.
*   **WordPress Access:** The attacker requires access to the WordPress admin panel with the aforementioned privileges.

**Additional Details from the Provided Content:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.5.4.
*   The patched version is 1.6.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Akbar Kustirama.
*   The provided changelog diff shows that the fix involved escaping output to protect against XSS.
*   The code diff shows the addition of `esc_attr` and `esc_html` escaping functions in `simple-google-map-short-code.php` which are responsible for sanitizing HTML attributes and content, respectively
