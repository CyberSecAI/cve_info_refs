Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10754

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of user-controlled input within the `dymanic_table.php` file. Specifically, the `$aScripts[$i]` variable, which is directly influenced by user input via the `scripts` parameter, is used to construct a `<script>` tag's `src` attribute without any encoding or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize user input before embedding it into the HTML, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially steal session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
- **Defacement:** An attacker could modify the content of the page, potentially defacing the website.
- **Malware Distribution:** Malicious scripts could be injected that redirect to or download malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Parameter Injection:** The `scripts` parameter in the URL is the attack vector. By crafting a malicious URL with the XSS payload within this parameter, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability when a user visits the manipulated link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `scripts` parameter in the `dymanic_table.php` file is vulnerable to XSS.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious URL:** The attacker must be able to craft a URL containing a malicious JavaScript payload in the `scripts` parameter.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker requires the victim to visit the malicious link for the exploit to trigger in their browser. This is a typical characteristic of a reflected XSS attack.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet is:

```php
echo '<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript" src="../'.$aScripts[$i].'?rand='.rand().'"></script>';
```

- This code takes the unsanitized user input from `$aScripts[$i]` and directly inserts it into the `src` attribute of a `<script>` tag.
- The provided example payload is: `%22%3E%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert('XSS')%3C/script%3E`. When decoded, this payload becomes `"><\/script><script>alert('XSS')</script>`.
- When inserted into the `src` attribute, the closing `</script>` tag effectively terminates the original `<script>` tag and opens a new one where the `alert('XSS')` is executed.

**Mitigation:**
- The recommended solution is to sanitize user input by using `htmlspecialchars()` in PHP with the correct encoding to escape any HTML special characters:
```php
echo '<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript" src="../' . htmlspecialchars($aScripts[$i], ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8') . '?rand=' . rand() . '"></script>';
```

This will encode special characters, preventing the injection of malicious code.
