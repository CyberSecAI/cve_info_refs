The provided content relates to CVE-2024-10993.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of input validation and sanitization in the `manage_website.php` file, specifically when handling file uploads. The `$_FILES` input is directly used to determine the storage location of the uploaded file without any verification or cleaning.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload vulnerability.
- Lack of input validation and sanitization on file upload handling.
- Direct use of user-controlled input (`$_FILES`) to determine file storage location.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- File overwrite.
- File injection.
- Directory traversal attacks.
- Denial of service (DoS) attacks.
- Potential remote code execution (RCE).

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious file upload through the vulnerable `manage_website.php` file.
- Attacker can control the file name and potentially the file path due to lack of sanitization.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the file upload functionality of the `manage_website.php` file. This may require some level of authentication or network access depending on the application.
- The attacker does not need specific privileges, only access to the upload feature.
