The Yaad Sarig Payment Gateway For WC plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification & access of data due to a missing capability check on the yaadpay_view_log_callback() and yaadpay_delete_log_callback() functions in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to view and delete logs.
