Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-supplied input in the `login.php` file of the "Restaurant Order System In PHP With Source Code" project. Specifically, the `uid` parameter is used directly in SQL queries without any form of cleaning.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of input sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access**: Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Sensitive Data Leakage**: Attackers can access sensitive information stored in the database without logging in.
- **Data Tampering**: Attackers can modify or delete data in the database.
- **System Control**: Attackers can potentially gain comprehensive control of the system.
- **Service Interruption**: The vulnerability could lead to service interruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exposed through the `uid` parameter in the login form.
- The attack vector is a POST request to the `index.php` file with a crafted `uid` parameter containing malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send POST requests to the application's login form (`index.php`).
- No prior authentication is required for the vulnerability to be exploited.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable File: `login.php`
- Affected Parameter: `uid`
- Vulnerability Type: Time-based Blind SQL Injection
- Example Payload: `uid=admin' AND (SELECT 2515 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))Fzvn) AND 'Fqet'='Fqet&passwd=admin&submit=Sign in`

**Mitigation:**
- The provided content suggests using prepared statements with parameter binding, input validation, least privilege database user, and regular security audits.
