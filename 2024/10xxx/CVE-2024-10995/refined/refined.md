The provided content is related to CVE-2024-10995.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `removeDoctorResult.php` file of the 'Hospital Appointment System In PHP With Source Code' project. This is caused by the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `Name` parameter before it's used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the direct use of user-supplied input (`Name` parameter) in SQL queries without proper sanitization. This allows for SQL injection. The vulnerability is present in the `removeDoctorResult.php` file. The vulnerability is described as being boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based blind.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the HTTP POST request to the `removeDoctorResult.php` file with a manipulated `Name` parameter containing malicious SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application. No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.
The attacker must craft a malicious payload within the Name parameter to exploit the vulnerability.
