Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `update_authors_list_ajax` AJAX action in the Authors List plugin not properly validating user input before passing it to the `do_shortcode` function. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary shortcodes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Shortcode Execution:** The primary weakness is the ability to execute shortcodes without authentication. This means an attacker doesn't need to be logged in or have any specific privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Insecure Data Handling:** The plugin fails to sanitize or validate the input received via the AJAX request, leading to the code injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Shortcode Execution:** Attackers can execute any registered shortcode on the WordPress site. This can be used for various malicious purposes.
*   **Potential for Full Site Compromise:** By using shortcodes that provide file access or execute PHP code, an attacker could potentially achieve full site control.
*   **Data Exfiltration/Manipulation:** If the exploited shortcode has database access, it could be used to extract or modify sensitive data.
*   **Denial of Service:** By executing resource-intensive shortcodes, an attacker could cause performance issues or a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **AJAX Request:** The attack vector is through an AJAX request to the `wp_ajax_update_authors_list_ajax` or `wp_ajax_nopriv_update_authors_list_ajax` action hooks.
*   **Crafted POST Data:** The attacker sends a crafted POST request to trigger the vulnerable function, including the malicious shortcode in a parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need to have any account on the target WordPress website.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the WordPress site to send HTTP requests.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable AJAX action (`update_authors_list_ajax`) and how to construct the malicious request.

**Technical Details (from `plugins.trac.wordpress.org`):**
The vulnerability lies within the `update_authors_list_ajax` function, specifically how it handles the `$_POST['shortcode']` parameter. This parameter contains the shortcode that will be processed.

```php
public function update_authors_list_ajax() {
    // ...
    $shortcode = isset( $_POST['shortcode'] ) ? wp_unslash( $_POST['shortcode'] ) : '';
    // ...
    $output = do_shortcode( "[authors_list id={$shortcode_id} $search_atts $search_column_atts $filter_atts ajax_request='yes']" );

    wp_send_json_success( $output );
}
```
The `$_POST['shortcode']` is not validated or sanitized, which allows an attacker to inject a malicious shortcode. The `do_shortcode()` function then executes this malicious code.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Wordfence article explicitly states that this vulnerability is an "Unauthenticated Arbitrary Shortcode Execution via update\_authors\_list\_ajax".
*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of the plugin up to and including version 2.0.4.
*   Version 2.0.5 of the plugin includes a security fix.
*   The plugin's description on wordpress.org highlights that the free version offers basic features and the PRO version includes more advanced features like Styler, Search, and Filters.

In summary, this CVE is about a critical security flaw in the Authors List plugin that allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes by exploiting a lack of input validation in an AJAX function. This vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.3, making it a high-risk issue.
