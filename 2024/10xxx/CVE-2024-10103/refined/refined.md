- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The MailPoet plugin allows a user with administrative privileges (Admin+) to inject malicious scripts through the "Custom HTML" block within a form. The plugin does not properly sanitize the "Custom Text" field, resulting in stored XSS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to account takeover, backdoors, and other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with Admin+ privileges can create a new form, add a "Custom HTML" block, and insert an XSS payload within the "Custom Text" field. When a user previews the form the payload will be executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative access (Admin+) to the WordPress site.
