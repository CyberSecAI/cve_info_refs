  "CVE-2024-10524": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability, later assigned CVE-2024-10524, may lead to various types of attacks – including phishing, SSRF, and MiTM. These attacks can have severe consequences such as resource restriction bypass and sensitive information exposure.\n\nIt has been discovered that when using the HTTP shorthand format with user-provided input, unexpected behavior may occur. Wget might issue an FTP request to a different host – a potentially attacker-controlled host or a restricted host which the user normally does not have access to. This SSRF vulnerability can be the starting point for many types of attacks.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Wget incorrectly parses URLs when using the HTTP shorthand format with user-provided input, leading to unexpected behavior, where it might interpret a colon within the username portion of a URL as a signal to switch to FTP, which then sends the request to an attacker-controlled host.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper parsing of URLs",
      "Server-side request forgery (SSRF)",
      "Man-in-the-middle (MiTM) potential",
       "Phishing"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can perform phishing, SSRF, and MiTM attacks. These attacks can lead to resource restriction bypass, sensitive information exposure, and the potential for malware installation.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when Wget is provided a URL in the shorthand HTTP format, with a colon within the username portion of the URL, allowing the attacker to control the destination host.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control the input provided to Wget when it parses a shorthand HTTP URL that includes a colon in the username portion. The attacker also needs a domain to redirect the request to."
