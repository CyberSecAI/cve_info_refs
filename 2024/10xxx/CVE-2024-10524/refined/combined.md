# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by

Accelerating Secure Pipelines with Multisite, Hybrid DevSecOps

“The capabilities of Artifactory are what allow us to do what we can do today…With Xray, [security] is a no-brainer – it’s built in, just turn it on, wow! I’ll take that all day long.”

 Kroger Retail

![Wget 0-Day 863x300](data:image/svg+xml...)![Wget 0-Day 863x300](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/18180642/Wget-0-Day-863x300-1.png)

While researching [CVE-2024-38428](https://jfrog.com/blog/cve-2024-38428-wget-vuln-all-you-need-to-know/) in GNU’s Wget, our team found a new 0-day vulnerability. The vulnerability, later assigned CVE-2024-10524, may lead to various types of attacks – including phishing, SSRF, and MiTM. These attacks can have severe consequences such as resource restriction bypass and sensitive information exposure.

Upon discovering this vulnerability, our team responsibly disclosed it to the Wget maintainers. A [patch](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/wget.git/commit/?id=c419542d956a2607bbce5df64b9d378a8588d778) was released on November 11 and is included in Wget 1.25.0.

## CVE-2024-10524 Overview

[Wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) is a popular program that is used to download content from servers and is part of the GNU project. It primarily supports the HTTP and FTP protocols.

In addition to normal URLs (e.g. *http://user@host/file* or *ftp://host/file*), Wget supported shorthand URL formats. For example, *wget user@host/file* would issue a request for *http://user@host/file*, and *wget host:/file* would issue a request for *ftp://host/file*. These two formats have been considered deprecated for quite some time now. They were originally  introduced by NcFTP and Netscape, which is why Wget supported them.

It has been discovered that when using the HTTP shorthand format with user-provided input, unexpected behavior may occur. Wget might issue an FTP request to a different host – a potentially attacker-controlled host or a restricted host which the user normally does not have access to. This SSRF vulnerability can be the starting point for many types of attacks.

## Which versions of Wget are affected?

CVE-2024-10524 is a medium severity vulnerability that affects any Wget version up to and including 1.24.5, with 1.25.0 including a fix for this issue. Users are recommended to update their Wget to version 1.25.0 to avoid this vulnerability.

## Are you affected by CVE-2024-10524?

The CVE is only exploitable when a vulnerable Wget version is used and the attacker is able to control the credentials in a shorthand HTTP URL that is supplied to Wget. See the example below.

## CVE-2024-10524 In-Depth Details and Exploitation

Consider an application that uses Wget to access a remote resource using shorthand HTTP, and passes the user’s credentials in the *userinfo* part of the URL. For example:

*wget user\_input@host/file*

The application should sanitize the input, and make sure that it doesn’t contain characters that allow for command injection. However, it should allow the user to input a colon – a character which is allowed to be part of *userinfo*. But this may be dangerous. Let’s see what Wget does when receiving a URL like *user:input@example.com/filename* – which should issue an HTTP request for *example.com*, requesting the file *filename*.

Almost the first thing the program does after parsing the command line arguments, is checking if the URL provided to it is written in shorthand format. This is done in *rewrite\_shorthand\_url*, located in *url.c*. The function receives the URL, and returns either a full URL or NULL if the URL is not shorthanded. The function first checks if the URL is already in a normal, full format. It then searches for either a colon or a slash in the URL:

```

   char *
   rewrite_shorthand_url (const char *url)
   {
     const char *p;
     char *ret;

    if (url_scheme (url) != SCHEME_INVALID)
       return NULL;

    /* Look for a ':' or '/'.  The former signifies NcFTP syntax, the
        latter Netscape.  */
    p = strpbrk (url, ":/");
     if (p == url)
       return NULL;

    ...
   }

```

If a colon is found, Wget concludes that the URL is a shorthand FTP request (unless the colon is followed by a number representing a port). If a colon is not found, Wget converts the URL to an HTTP URL:

```

   if (p && *p == ':')
       {
         /* Colon indicates ftp, as in foo.bar.com:path.  Check for
            special case of http port number ("localhost:10000").  */
         int digits = strspn (p + 1, "0123456789");
         if (digits && (p[1 + digits] == '/' || p[1 + digits] == '\0'))
           goto http;

         /* Turn "foo.bar.com:path" to "ftp://foo.bar.com/path". */
         if ((ret = aprintf ("ftp://%s", url)) != NULL)
           ret[6 + (p - url)] = '/';
       }
     else
       {
       http:
         /* Just prepend "http://" to URL. */
         ret = aprintf ("http://%s", url);
       }

```

Thus, if Wget finds a colon anywhere in the URL, it considers it an FTP URL. So in our example, running *wget user:input@example.com/file* would issue an FTP request for the domain *user*, requesting the file *input@example.com/file*. This behavior is unexpected, and an attacker might utilize this to initiate an attack.

We have responsibly disclosed this vulnerability to Wget, and a patch has been released. The patch removes support for the FTP shorthand format, since it was already considered deprecated and is not supported by other tools which are similar to Wget.

As you can see in the examples section below, this vulnerability can lead to all kinds of dangerous attacks. However, we have decided to give it a [Medium CVSS score](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L). Note that using the HTTP shorthand format with user input is very uncommon, so exploitation of this CVE in real-world scenarios is unlikely.

## CVE-2024-10524 Examples

Let’s take a look at a few examples and see how this vulnerability can be exploited.

### SSRF

First, let’s see how this issue can lead to an SSRF (server-side request forgery) attack. Consider an app that connects to an external web server using a user’s username. So, for a user named *myuser*, the server would issue an HTTP request for *myuser@myserver*.

Notice how the user cannot and should not have any control over the domain name (*myserver*). Still, by utilizing this issue, an attacker could actually change it. For example, the attacker could buy the domain *maliciousdomain*, and then register as the user *maliciousdomain:aaa*. The URL in this case would be *maliciousdomain:aaa@reliableserver*. Wget would interpret this as an FTP shorthand URL, which would cause the request to be sent to *maliciousdomain* – the attacker’s domain.

This scenario gives the attacker the ability to perform an SSRF attack, by providing a malicious username to the app that will be used by Wget as the host to connect to. For example, the app might use Wget to download content from a remote URL and display it to the user. By exploiting this vulnerability the attacker is able to change the host in the URL that is used in Wget and obtain access to an internal address that is normally inaccessible externally. For example, a local server that stores sensitive PII information that is accessible only from an internal network.

The attack can be seen in the image below, where the request for the should be sent to *reliableserver*, but gets sent to *maliciousdomain* instead.

![ maliciousdomain-code1.png](data:image/svg+xml...)![ maliciousdomain-code1.png](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/17193059/maliciousdomain-code1.png)

### Phishing

Another example of where this vulnerability can be exploited is in a phishing attack. In this scenario, the attacker could have the victim make a request for a file from *maliciousdomain:@reliableserver* (note the colon before the *@* sign). The victim, seeing the reliable hostname *reliableserver*, might trust this link. But as we have seen before, the link would actually turn the user to the attacker’s domain – *maliciousdomain*. The attacker could then provide the user with a malicious file that looks like it is reliable, but in fact executes malicious code when opened.

### Man In The Middle

This vulnerability can also be used to initiate a MiTM attack. The attacker could supply a user with the link *maliciousdomain:@reliableserver*. The user, seeing the hostname *reliableserver*, might trust this link and use it. In reality however, the link would bring the user to *maliciousdomain*. Up until now, everything is the same as the phishing attack described before. In this scenario, however, the attacker could take it a step further by acting as a proxy between the user and reliableserver, effectively committing a man-in-the-middle attack.

### Data Leakage

Finally, the vulnerability could also lead to data leakage. The app might provide the user with error logs if something fails. If this is the case, an attacker can cause the request to fail by supplying crafted credentials and leak the original hostname. Sensitive data can also be leaked by other forms of attacks like SSRF or MiTM.

## How to resolve CVE-2024-10524?

A fixed Wget version which addresses this issue, 1.25.0, has already been released. Users are recommended to upgrade to it.

## Is it possible to mitigate CVE-2024-10524 without upgrading?

It is possible to mitigate CVE-2024-10524 without upgrading or hurting Wget functionality, by converting all shorthand HTTP requests to their full format. For example, convert *wget input@myserver* to *wget http://input@myserver* or preferably to *wget https://input@myserver* if HTTPS is supported.

## Is the JFrog Platform Vulnerable to CVE-2024-10524?

After conducting internal research, we can confirm that the [JFrog Platform](https://jfrog.com/platform/) is not vulnerable to Wget’s CVE-2024-10524.

# Fwd: wget-1.25.0 released [fixes CVE-2024-10524]

*From*: Alan Coopersmith <alan.coopersmith () oracle com>

*Date*: Mon, 18 Nov 2024 11:06:36 -0800

```

The JFrog Security Research Team has posted about this vulnerability in:
  <https://jfrog.com/blog/cve-2024-10524-wget-zero-day-vulnerability/>

They say:

"The vulnerability, later assigned CVE-2024-10524, may lead to various types of
 attacks – including phishing, SSRF, and MiTM. These attacks can have severe
 consequences such as resource restriction bypass and sensitive information
 exposure."

and

"It has been discovered that when using the HTTP shorthand format with user-
 provided input, unexpected behavior may occur. Wget might issue an FTP request
 to a different host – a potentially attacker-controlled host or a restricted
 host which the user normally does not have access to. This SSRF vulnerability
 can be the starting point for many types of attacks."

-------- Forwarded Message --------
Subject: wget-1.25.0 released [stable]
Date: Mon, 11 Nov 2024 16:36:47 +0100
From: Darshit Shah <darnir () gnu org>
To: info-gnu () gnu org
CC: coordinator () translationproject org, bug-wget () gnu org

I'm glad to announce wget-1.25.0, a new stable release.

GNU wget is a free software package for retrieving files using HTTP, HTTPS and FTP,
the most widely-used Internet protocols. It is a non-interactive command-line tool,
so it may easily be called from scripts, cron jobs, terminals without X Window System support, etc.

There are two breaking changes in this release.
The first and more important one is that the shorthand format for both HTTP
and FTP URLs has been entirely removed. This format was previously deprecated
and is now no longer supported. This means invocations of the form:

```
$ wget username:password@myserver
```
will now result in a URL error. Users must use the full form:
```
$ wget <http://username:password@myserver>
```

The other breaking change is that input file reads are now non-blocking.
Suppose you used the following invocation
```
$ print_urls | wget -i-
```
to retrieve a list of URLs provided to Wget on stdin. Previously, wget would
attempt to read everything it could at the beginning, close stdin and retrieve
all URLs. With 1.25.0, Wget will continuously keep reading from the pipe until
the other end closes the pipe.
This feature is currently not available on Windows.

There were other minor changes and stability improvements.

There have been 46 commits by 3 people in the 35 weeks since 1.24.5.

See the NEWS below for a brief summary.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed!
The following people contributed changes to this release:

   Darshit Shah (13)
   Sam James (2)
   Tim Rühsen (31)

==================================================================

Here is the GNU wget home page:
     <https://gnu.org/s/wget/>

For a summary of changes and contributors, see:
   <https://git.sv.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=wget.git;a=shortlog;h=v1.25.0>
or run this command from a git-cloned wget directory:
   git shortlog v1.24.5..v1.25.0

Here are the compressed sources:
   [https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/wget/wget-1.25.0.tar.gz](https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/wget/wget-1.25.0.tar.gz%C2%A0%C2%A0) (5.1MB)
   [https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/wget/wget-1.25.0.tar.lz](https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/wget/wget-1.25.0.tar.lz%C2%A0%C2%A0) (2.5MB)

Here are the GPG detached signatures:
   <https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/wget/wget-1.25.0.tar.gz.sig>
   <https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/wget/wget-1.25.0.tar.lz.sig>

Use a mirror for higher download bandwidth:
   <https://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html>

Here are the SHA1 and SHA256 checksums:

   939b74b0759a2e5f57ec9ac12f5b4403fd9cf5cf  wget-1.25.0.tar.gz
   dm5IQj55NZ6jHkHbnlwolnWUen/PLv3O23JqydDaN4Q=  wget-1.25.0.tar.gz
   ca79e61fbf1d32133f60ef7c7d476b250b6da423  wget-1.25.0.tar.lz
   GSJcx1awoIj8gRSNxqQKDI8ymvf9hIPxx7L+UPTgih8=  wget-1.25.0.tar.lz

Verify the base64 SHA256 checksum with cksum -a sha256 --check
from coreutils-9.2 or OpenBSD's cksum since 2007.

Use a .sig file to verify that the corresponding file (without the
.sig suffix) is intact.  First, be sure to download both the .sig file
and the corresponding tarball.  Then, run a command like this:

   gpg --verify wget-1.25.0.tar.gz.sig

The signature should match the fingerprint of the following key:

   pub   rsa4096 2015-10-14 [SC]
         7845 120B 07CB D8D6 ECE5  FF2B 2A17 43ED A91A 35B6
   uid   Darshit Shah <gpg () darnir net>
   uid   Darshit Shah <darnir () gnu org>

If that command fails because you don't have the required public key,
or that public key has expired, try the following commands to retrieve
or refresh it, and then rerun the 'gpg --verify' command.

   gpg --locate-external-key gpg () darnir net

   gpg --recv-keys 64FF90AAE8C70AF9

   wget -q -O- '[https://savannah.gnu.org/project/release-gpgkeys.php?group=wget&download=1'](https://savannah.gnu.org/project/release-gpgkeys.php?group=wget&download=1&apos); | gpg --import -

As a last resort to find the key, you can try the official GNU
keyring:

   wget -q <https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg>
   gpg --keyring gnu-keyring.gpg --verify wget-1.25.0.tar.gz.sig

This release was bootstrapped with the following tools:
   Autoconf 2.72
   Automake 1.17
   Gnulib v1.0-1057-g74b6a2a738

## GNU Wget

---

GNU Wget is a [free software](/philosophy/free-sw)
package for retrieving files using HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and FTPS, the most widely used
Internet protocols. It is a non-interactive commandline tool, so it may
easily be called from scripts, `cron` jobs, terminals without
X-Windows support, etc.

GNU Wget has many features to make retrieving large files or mirroring
entire web or FTP sites easy, including:

* Can resume aborted downloads, using `REST` and `RANGE`
* Can use filename wild cards and recursively mirror directories
* NLS-based message files for many different languages
* Optionally converts absolute links in downloaded documents to relative,
  so that downloaded documents may link to each other
  locally
* Runs on most UNIX-like operating systems as well as Microsoft Windows
* Supports HTTP proxies
* Supports HTTP cookies
* Supports persistent HTTP connections
* Unattended / background operation
* Uses local file timestamps to determine whether documents need to be re-downloaded when mirroring
* GNU Wget is distributed under the [GNU General Public License](/licenses/gpl.html).

### Downloading GNU Wget

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```

# CVE-2024-38428 Wget Vulnerability: All you need to know

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/12182110/863x300-5-1.png)

On Sunday, June 2nd 2024, a fix commit was pushed for a vulnerability in GNU’s popular Wget tool. Two weeks later, the vulnerability was assigned the ID CVE-2024-38428 and later was classified as a critical vulnerability – with a CVSS score of 9.1.

In this blog, we take a dive deep into this threat by seeing what caused it, what consequences it might have, and how it can be mitigated. Due to the reasonable prerequisites for exploiting this vulnerability and the  large number of vulnerable versions, we believe that there is a strong likelihood that this vulnerability will be exploited in practice and therefore strongly recommend mitigating this issue as soon as possible.

In this blog we demonstrate how attackers can exploit this vulnerability, and it might lead to common attacks such as phishing, SSRF and MiTM. These attacks can have severe consequences such as resource restriction bypass, sensitive information exposure and even installation of malware on the victim’s machine.

## Which versions of Wget are affected?

CVE-2024-38428 is a critical severity vulnerability that affects any Wget version up to and including 1.24.5. A fixed version of Wget was still not available at the time of the publishing of this blog post. However, some Linux distributions did provide a fix in their systems, see [“How to resolve CVE-2024-38428” below for more details](#how-to-resolve-cve-2024-38428).

## CVE-2024-38428 Overview

[Wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) is a popular program that is used to download content from servers and is part of the GNU project. It primarily supports the HTTP and FTP protocols.

[RFC-2396](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2396) is an outdated standard from 1998 that defines the syntax and format of a URL. In general, a URL is of the form `scheme://[userinfo@]host[:port]/path[?query][#fragment]`. The `userinfo` part consists of information about the user, like a username. Although the standard is outdated, it is the standard that is used in Wget’s `url.c` file which is responsible for parsing URLs.

It was discovered that Wget doesn’t parse `userinfo` correctly. According to the standard, a URI can include a semicolon in its `userinfo`. However, Wget parses URIs in a way that causes `userinfo` to be considered part of the `host` if it contains a semicolon. This means that the `host` part of the URI could be interpreted incorrectly and be abused by attackers that control the `userinfo`.

Misinterpretation of the `host` segment might lead to DNS queries being sent to incorrect and potentially malicious domains. This can have severe consequences, like resource restriction bypass, sensitive information leakage, and remote code execution.

## Are you affected by CVE-2024-38428?

The CVE is only exploitable when a vulnerable Wget version is used in specific conditions:

* The attacker needs to be able to control the credentials in the URL that is supplied to Wget.
* When Wget is used to connect to an FTP or FTPS URLs the attacker can utilize the CVE to completely replace the hostname that Wget connects to – this is the most severe outcome of exploiting this vulnerability which we demonstrate in the [examples section below](#cve-2024-38428-examples). If the HTTP protocol is used, the attacker can control the hostname but the hostname will contain invalid characters (like semicolon) that will limit the attack surface and the options to carry out an attack with a severe outcome (like SSRF).

## CVE-2024-38428 In-Depth Details and Exploitation

The function `url_skip_credentials()` is used in Wget while parsing a URL. The function receives a pointer to the URI, and returns a pointer to the part of the URI where the `host` segment begins. The function scans the URI for the `@` character, and for any “terminating characters” found in `userinfo`.

```
 static const char *
url_skip_credentials (const char *url)
{
  /* Look for '@' that comes before terminators, such as '/', '?',
     '#', or ';'.  */
  const char *p = (const char *)strpbrk (url, "@/?#;");
  if (!p || *p != '@')
    return url;
  return p + 1;
}

```

If the function finds a `@` character, it returns a pointer to the character that follows it. But if it finds a terminating character before the `@` character, it returns a pointer to the full URI. As can be seen in the code snippet, the string defining the terminating characters includes a semicolon. This causes the code to behave differently than what the standard demands, because a semicolon is a character that is actually allowed to be part of `userinfo`.

So when a semicolon is used in the `userinfo` segment, Wget interprets that the `host` segment begins where the `userinfo` segment actually begins. For example, the URL `http://us;er@host` will result in a request for the hostname `us;er@host`. But there is a problem – as a domain name can only contain a specific set of characters, which does not include `;` and `@`. So, theoretically, this vulnerability will always lead to failed DNS requests – unless we find some way to discard the rest of the URL.

After some research, we discovered a way to take advantage of this vulnerability and send the request to a hostname of our choice. In order to understand it, let’s take a look at the function `init_seps()`. This function, located in `url.c`, is responsible for providing a string specifying the hostname terminators based on the URL scheme.

```
 static const char *
init_seps (enum url_scheme scheme)
{
  static char seps[8] = ":/";
  char *p = seps + 2;
  int flags = supported_schemes[scheme].flags;

  if (flags & scm_has_params)
    *p++ = ';';
  if (flags & scm_has_query)
    *p++ = '?';
  if (flags & scm_has_fragment)
    *p++ = '#';
  *p = '\0';
  return seps;
}

```

The characters provided by this function are later used to find the end of the `host` segment in the URL:

```
seps = init_seps (scheme);
...
p = strpbrk_or_eos (p, seps);
host_e = p;
```

For HTTP and HTTPS, `init_seps()` returns the string `“?#”`. Both `?` and `#` are characters that are not allowed to be included as part of `userinfo`, so they can’t be used by an attacker to discard the rest of the URL.

This is where the FTP and FTPS protocols come into play. These protocols can also be used in Wget, but work a little differently than HTTP. Notably, it has different hostname terminators – `;` and `#`. According to the RFC it is permissible to use a semicolon in `userinfo`, but an attacker can take advantage of this by using a URL like `ftp://attackerhost;@host`. This URL would result in a request being sent to `attackerhost` – an unintended and potentially malicious domain.

## CVE-2024-38428 Examples

Let’s take a look at a few examples and see how this vulnerability can be exploited.

### SSRF

First, let’s see how this issue can lead to an SSRF (server-side request forgery) attack. Consider an app which connects to an external web server using a user’s username. So, for a user named `myuser`, the server would issue a request for `ftp://myuser@myserver`.

In addition, the app should apply escaping protection to make sure that characters such as `#` cannot be present in a username. According to the RFC, however, a semicolon is allowed to be part of `userinfo` – so the app should allow it.

Notice how the user cannot and should not have any control over the domain name (`myserver`). Still, by utilizing this issue, an attacker could actually change it. For example, the attacker could buy the domain `maliciousdomain`, and then register as the user `maliciousdomain;`. The URL in this case would be `ftp://maliciousdomain;@reliableserver`. Note that the semicolon would cause Wget to interpret the beginning of `host` as the beginning of `userinfo`, and it also serves as a hostname terminator. This would cause the request to be sent to `maliciousdomain` – the attacker’s domain.

The attacker could then easily perform an SSRF attack, and provide a malicious file to the app. For example, the app might store information about users’ permissions (i.e. admin or not) on an external server, and by exploiting this vulnerability, the attacker could simply return a file that classifies his user as having admin permissions.

The attack can be seen in the image below, where the request for the file should be sent to `reliableserver`, but gets sent to `maliciousdomain` instead.

### Phishing

Another example of where this vulnerability can be exploited is in a phishing attack. In this scenario, the attacker could have the victim make a request for a file from `ftp://maliciousdomain;@reliableserver`. The victim, seeing the reliable hostname `reliableserver`, might trust this link. But as we have seen before, the link would actually turn the user to the attacker’s domain – `maliciousdomain`. The attacker could then provide the user with a malicious file that looks like it is reliable, but in fact executes malicious code when opened.

### Man In The Middle

This vulnerability can also be used to initiate a MiTM attack. The attacker could supply a user with the link `ftp://maliciousdomain;@reliableserver`. The user, seeing the hostname `reliableserver`, might trust this link and use it. In reality however, the link would bring the user to `maliciousdomain`. Up until now, everything is the same as the phishing attack described before. In this scenario, however, the attacker could take it a step further by acting as a proxy between the user and `reliableserver`, effectively committing a man-in-the-middle attack.

### Data Leakage

Finally, the vulnerability could also lead to data leakage. The app might provide the user with error logs if something fails. If this is the case, an attacker can cause the request to fail by supplying crafted `userinfo` credentials and leak the original hostname. Sensitive data can also be leaked by other forms of attacks like SSRF or MiTM.

## How to resolve CVE-2024-38428?

As of the time of this writing, there is still no fixed version available upstream. At this stage, it is important to identify any versions that might be at risk and update them immediately to the fixed version as soon as they become available.

In spite of the upstream version being unpatched, several Linux vendors have already published fixed versions of Wget, most notably [Red Hat](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-38428), [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2024-38428), [Debian](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-38428) and [SUSE](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-38428.html).

Fixes are still pending for [Alpine](https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2024-38428).

## Is it possible to mitigate CVE-2024-38428 without upgrading?

It is possible to mitigate CVE-2024-38428 without hurting Wget functionality, by not allowing for a semicolon to be present in the `userinfo` part of a URI or if possible, by disallowing user-provided data in the userinfo.

## Is the JFrog Platform Vulnerable to CVE-2024-38428?

After conducting internal research, we can confirm that the [JFrog DevOps Platform](https://jfrog.com/platform/) is not vulnerable to Wget’s CVE-2024-38428.

Subject: Fwd: wget-1.25.0 released [fixes CVE-2024-10524]

The JFrog Security Research Team has posted about this vulnerability in:
   <https://jfrog.com/blog/cve-2024-10524-wget-zero-day-vulnerability/>

They say:

"The vulnerability, later assigned CVE-2024-10524, may lead to various types of
  attacks – including phishing, SSRF, and MiTM. These attacks can have severe
  consequences such as resource restriction bypass and sensitive information
  exposure."

and

"It has been discovered that when using the HTTP shorthand format with user-
  provided input, unexpected behavior may occur. Wget might issue an FTP request
  to a different host – a potentially attacker-controlled host or a restricted
  host which the user normally does not have access to. This SSRF vulnerability
  can be the starting point for many types of attacks."

Subject: wget-1.25.0 released [stable]
Date: Mon, 11 Nov 2024 16:36:47 +0100
From: Darshit Shah <darnir@....org>
To: info-gnu@....org
CC: coordinator@...nslationproject.org, bug-wget@....org

I'm glad to announce wget-1.25.0, a new stable release.

GNU wget is a free software package for retrieving files using HTTP, HTTPS and FTP,
the most widely-used Internet protocols. It is a non-interactive command-line tool,
so it may easily be called from scripts, cron jobs, terminals without X Window System support, etc.

There are two breaking changes in this release.
The first and more important one is that the shorthand format for both HTTP
and FTP URLs has been entirely removed. This format was previously deprecated
and is now no longer supported. This means invocations of the form:

```
$ wget username:password@...erver
```
will now result in a URL error. Users must use the full form:
```
$ wget http://username:password@...erver
```

The other breaking change is that input file reads are now non-blocking.
Suppose you used the following invocation
```
$ print_urls | wget -i-
```
to retrieve a list of URLs provided to Wget on stdin. Previously, wget would
attempt to read everything it could at the beginning, close stdin and retrieve
all URLs. With 1.25.0, Wget will continuously keep reading from the pipe until
the other end closes the pipe.
This feature is currently not available on Windows.

There were other minor changes and stability improvements.

There have been 46 commits by 3 people in the 35 weeks since 1.24.5.

See the NEWS below for a brief summary.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed!
The following people contributed changes to this release:

    Darshit Shah (13)
    Sam James (2)

Here is the GNU wget home page:
      <https://gnu.org/s/wget/>

For a summary of changes and contributors, see:
    <https://git.sv.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=wget.git;a=shortlog;h=v1.25.0>
or run this command from a git-cloned wget directory:
    git shortlog v1.24.5..v1.25.0

Here are the compressed sources:
    <https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/wget/wget-1.25.0.tar.gz>   (5.1MB)
    <https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/wget/wget-1.25.0.tar.lz>   (2.5MB)

Here are the GPG detached signatures:
    <https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/wget/wget-1.25.0.tar.gz.sig>
    <https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/wget/wget-1.25.0.tar.lz.sig>

Use a mirror for higher download bandwidth:
    <https://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html>

Here are the SHA1 and SHA256 checksums:

    939b74b0759a2e5f57ec9ac12f5b4403fd9cf5cf  wget-1.25.0.tar.gz
    dm5IQj55NZ6jHkHbnlwolnWUen/PLv3O23JqydDaN4Q=  wget-1.25.0.tar.gz
    ca79e61fbf1d32133f60ef7c7d476b250b6da423  wget-1.25.0.tar.lz
    GSJcx1awoIj8gRSNxqQKDI8ymvf9hIPxx7L+UPTgih8=  wget-1.25.0.tar.lz

Verify the base64 SHA256 checksum with cksum -a sha256 --check
from coreutils-9.2 or OpenBSD's cksum since 2007.

Use a .sig file to verify that the corresponding file (without the
.sig suffix) is intact.  First, be sure to download both the .sig file
and the corresponding tarball.  Then, run a command like this:

    gpg --verify wget-1.25.0.tar.gz.sig

The signature should match the fingerprint of the following key:

    pub   rsa4096 2015-10-14 [SC]
          7845 120B 07CB D8D6 ECE5  FF2B 2A17 43ED A91A 35B6
    uid   Darshit Shah <gpg@...nir.net>
    uid   Darshit Shah <darnir@....org>

If that command fails because you don't have the required public key,
or that public key has expired, try the following commands to retrieve
or refresh it, and then rerun the 'gpg --verify' command.

    gpg --locate-external-key gpg@...nir.net

    gpg --recv-keys 64FF90AAE8C70AF9

    wget -q -O- '<https://savannah.gnu.org/project/release-gpgkeys.php?group=wget&download=1'> | gpg --import -

As a last resort to find the key, you can try the official GNU
keyring:

    wget -q <https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg>
    gpg --keyring gnu-keyring.gpg --verify wget-1.25.0.tar.gz.sig

This release was bootstrapped with the following tools:
    Autoconf 2.72
    Automake 1.17
    Gnulib v1.0-1057-g74b6a2a738
