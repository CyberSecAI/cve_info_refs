### Description

The Cowidgets – Elementor Addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.0 via the 'ce\_template' shortcode due to insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract data from private or draft posts created by Elementor that they should not have access to.

This widget is DRIVING ME CRAZY! It crashes my clients websites constantly to the point of costing me money because i have to switch themes for them for free because of its problems. The support is THE WORST! because the developers not only push the update 1.20 automatically (that is having the issue), i have tried EVERYTHING to block this process but there’s no way to keep version 1.1.0 that is problem free. The worst part? They aren’t trying to fix the problem for all user by doing a global update. Instead, they ask EVERY CUSTOMER to create a support ticket and FTP access to fix the problem individually.I swear, in more than 15 years working with Wordpress, haven’t faced an issue like this.

The plugin still shows the same version of 1.2.0 but yet was updated 2 months ago. Our site is broken. Downloading and installing the “latest” version doesn’t resolve the issues. Is there a newer version with the bugs fixed?

I took over a site built with Remake and this plugin, used for header & footer. With every update critical errors appear, previous versions cannot be found to attempt rollback, really bad.

Hi
After working just fine, after the update the whole site had a critical error. When I deactivate the plugin, site works fine (without footer / header menu’s though), when I activate, I get critical error. Please fix!
Edit: thanks for fixing 🙂
