Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient verification of the user data returned by social login tokens. Specifically, the plugin does not properly verify if the user is the actual owner of the account being used for social login.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Authentication:** The core weakness is the lack of proper authentication checks, allowing an attacker to bypass the intended login process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** An unauthenticated attacker can log in as any existing user on the site if they have access to the email and the user does not have an existing account for the service returning the token.
*   **Account Takeover:** Attackers can gain complete access to existing user accounts.
*   **Potential Privilege Escalation:** While not default, If social login is explicitly enabled for administrators, it can lead to full site compromise

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Social Login Mechanism:** Exploits the social login functionality of the plugin.
*   **Email Address:** Requires knowledge of the target user's email address.
*   **Lack of Account Association:** The vulnerability works when there is no existing account linked to the social login provider on the WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to have an account on the target WordPress site.
*   **Email Address:** The attacker needs to know the email address of the target user
*   **Social Login:** Requires that the WordPress site utilizes the social login feature of the vulnerable plugin

**Additional Details**
* The vulnerability was present in versions up to and including 1.1.35 of the "Heateor Social Login" WordPress plugin.
* The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.1.36
* The fix includes preventing the plugin from fetching email and other user profile data for Disqus and Spotify accounts as they cannot be verified. It also implements a check to ensure that Vkontakte accounts are verified and restricts redirects to only within the website domain.
