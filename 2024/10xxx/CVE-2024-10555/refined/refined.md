The provided content relates to CVE-2024-10555.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress MaxButtons plugin fails to sanitize and escape user-provided settings, specifically the `button_width` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges (e.g., admin) can inject malicious JavaScript code that is stored within the plugin's settings. When a user previews the button, the malicious code is executed in their browser. This can lead to various malicious actions, such as session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement of the website.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin's settings interface. The attacker modifies the `button_width` parameter, injecting the malicious payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high-level privileges, such as admin, within the WordPress installation. They also need the ability to create and modify buttons within the MaxButtons plugin.
