## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# MaxButtons < 9.8.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS via Button Width

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1) Create new Button
2) Intercept the request
3) Change button\_width to `160"+onmouseover=alert(1)//`
4) Go to preview of this button and move your mouse over the button to see the XSS

### Affects Plugins
