{
  "CVE-2024-10220": {
    "status": "RELEVANT",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the Kubernetes kubelet's handling of gitRepo volumes. Specifically, it allows a user with the ability to create a pod with a gitRepo volume to execute arbitrary commands by leveraging the hooks folder within the cloned repository.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Arbitrary command execution",
        "Insufficient validation of gitRepo volume contents",
        "Use of deprecated in-tree gitRepo volume"
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the node, outside of the container's boundary, potentially leading to complete compromise of the node and the cluster.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network access to the Kubernetes API server",
         "Creation of a malicious pod with a gitRepo volume"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create pods and associate gitRepo volumes. This typically requires a low level of privileges within the cluster."
    },
    "affected_versions": [
      "kubelet v1.30.0 to v1.30.2",
      "kubelet v1.29.0 to v1.29.6",
      "kubelet <= v1.28.11"
    ],
     "fixed_versions": [
      "kubelet v1.31.0",
      "kubelet v1.30.3",
      "kubelet v1.29.7",
      "kubelet v1.28.12"
    ],
    "remediation": "Upgrade to a fixed version. The recommended mitigation is to perform the Git clone operation using an init container and then mount the directory into the Pod's container, since the in-tree gitRepo volume is deprecated."
  }
