Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-10852:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check on the `buy_one_click_export_options` AJAX action within the "Buy one click WooCommerce" plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The primary weakness is the absence of a capability check, allowing unauthorized users to access the export functionality.
- **Insecure AJAX Action:** The `buy_one_click_export_options` AJAX action does not verify if the user has the required privileges to export plugin settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:** An attacker can export the plugin's settings. The specific nature of these settings is not detailed, but potentially sensitive configuration data could be revealed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attack is carried out over the network, likely by sending a crafted AJAX request.
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user on the WordPress site (Subscriber-level access or higher).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have an account on the affected WordPress site with at least Subscriber-level privileges.
- The attacker needs the knowledge of the vulnerable AJAX action and the proper request format to trigger the settings export.
