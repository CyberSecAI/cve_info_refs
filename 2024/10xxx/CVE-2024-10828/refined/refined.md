{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the insecure deserialization of user-controlled data during order export within the 'Advanced Order Export For WooCommerce' plugin. When the 'Try to convert serialized values' option is enabled, the plugin deserializes data without proper validation, leading to PHP Object Injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Deserialization of Untrusted Data",
      "PHP Object Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can inject a PHP object, which, when combined with an existing POP chain, can lead to arbitrary file deletion on the server. This could result in remote code execution if critical files such as wp-config.php are deleted.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the order export functionality of the plugin. An attacker can manipulate order details, which get serialized and later deserialized during export if the 'Try to convert serialized values' option is enabled.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the order details and have the 'Try to convert serialized values' option enabled. No authentication is needed for the initial exploit."
