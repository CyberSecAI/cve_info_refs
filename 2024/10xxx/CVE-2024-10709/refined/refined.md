- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape shortcode attributes before outputting them in a page or post.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a page or post, which will be executed when a user views the content. This can allow the attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or defacing the website.
- **Attack vectors**: By adding a crafted shortcode to a post or page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have at least contributor role access to the WordPress site in order to create or edit posts/pages and inject the malicious shortcode.
