### Description

The Content Slider Block plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.5 via the [csb] shortcode due to insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract data from password protected, private, or draft posts that they should not have access to.
