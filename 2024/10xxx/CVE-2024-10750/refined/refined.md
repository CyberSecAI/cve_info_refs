Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10750 (based on the context)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is triggered by a NULL pointer dereference within the `strlen` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The `strlen` function is called with a null pointer, leading to a segmentation fault. This happens because of specific conditions that are met when processing HTTP requests.
*   **Incorrect State Handling:** The vulnerability arises due to specific sequence of events related to the request processing, particularly in the `websUrlParse`, `websSetVar`, `socketGets` and `websReadEvent` functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The segmentation fault caused by the NULL pointer dereference leads to a crash of the web server process on the Tenda router. This results in a denial of service, making the router unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attack is executed by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to a specific endpoint (`/goform/GetIPTV?fgHPOST/goform/SysToo`). The request must include specific headers in a particular order with certain values.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Tenda router to send the malicious HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must have network access to the Tenda router (e.g., being on the same network or having remote access through port forwarding).
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to create HTTP requests, specifically the `POST` method with `Content-Length` headers.

**Detailed Explanation:**

The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request. The steps leading to the crash include:

1.  **URL Parsing:** The `websUrlParse` function parses the URL, specifically extracting the `query` part after `?` (e.g., `fgHPOST/goform/SysToo`).
2.  **Content-Length Setting:** The request includes two `Content-Length` headers. The first is set to a value >=1, then the second is set to 0. This sets certain flags and also the variable `clen` to 0.
3.  **Empty Body:** The request is followed by an empty line (`\r\n`). This results in the `socketGets` function reading an empty string.
4.  **State Transition:** The router's web server transitions to a specific state (`wp->state = 8`) in the `websGetInput` function because nbytes is set to 0 in the previous step.
5.  **Conditional Branching:** In `websReadEvent` function, the state check and the presence of `wp->query` results in the else branch being executed which leads to the `strlen` call on a NULL pointer.

**Vulnerable Software:**

*   Tenda router i22
*   Firmware Version: V1.0.0.3(4687)

**Additional Details from the Content:**
