## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Everest Forms < 3.0.4.2 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Create/edit a Form.
2. Add/edit an Email Block and change "Custom Required Message" field in main settings of Email Block to: &amp;lt;img src onerror=alert(1)&amp;gt;
3. Save the form
The XSS will be triggered when the form is submitted and the email field is empty

### Affects Plugins
