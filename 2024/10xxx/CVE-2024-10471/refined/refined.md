- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape user-provided input in the "Custom Required Message" field of an Email Block within the form settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with admin privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the context of other users when they interact with a form containing the malicious script. This can lead to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activity.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with admin access can create or edit a form and insert the XSS payload into the "Custom Required Message" field of an Email Block.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have admin level privileges to create or edit a form. The XSS is triggered when a user submits the form and the email field is empty.
