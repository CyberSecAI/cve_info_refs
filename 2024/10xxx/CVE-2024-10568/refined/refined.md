- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious actions, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through the plugin's settings page. Specifically, by injecting malicious code into the "Default image url" field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have high privileges such as an admin to access the plugin's settings page. The attacker also needs the ability to modify the vulnerable setting.
