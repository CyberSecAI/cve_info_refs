**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with contributor access or higher can access and view the content of unpublished, draft, or private Elementor templates.
- This could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, such as upcoming page layouts, design elements, or pre-release content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site with at least contributor level privileges.
- The attacker exploits the vulnerable `get_content_type` function by triggering the content reveal widget, specifically when set to display template content.
