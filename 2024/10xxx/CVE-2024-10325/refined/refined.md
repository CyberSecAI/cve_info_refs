*   The root cause is insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the "Elementor Header & Footer Builder" plugin when handling SVG file uploads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize SVG files uploaded through the REST API, allowing malicious code to be embedded. This allows the attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts that are stored on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** When a user accesses the compromised SVG file, the injected malicious scripts will execute within the user's browser.
*   **Potential for Account Takeover:** By exploiting the XSS vulnerability, attackers can potentially steal session cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, redirect users to malicious sites, or deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SVG File Upload:** Attackers exploit the file upload mechanism of the plugin.
*   **REST API:** The vulnerability is exploited via the REST API used for file uploads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** Attackers need to be authenticated users with at least Author-level access to the WordPress site.
