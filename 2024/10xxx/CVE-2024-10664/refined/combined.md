### Description

The Knowledge Base documentation & wiki plugin – BasePress Docs plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the basepress\_db\_posts\_update() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.16.3.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update the database.
