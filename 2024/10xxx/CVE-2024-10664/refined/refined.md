**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10664

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `basepress_db_posts_update()` function within the Knowledge Base documentation & wiki plugin â€“ BasePress Docs plugin for WordPress.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The plugin fails to properly verify user capabilities before allowing database updates through the `basepress_db_posts_update()` function.
- **Insecure Function:** The `basepress_db_posts_update()` function lacks necessary access control mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access or higher can modify data in the WordPress database.
- This could lead to unauthorized content manipulation, potential privilege escalation (depending on what is modified), or other forms of data tampering.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- It requires an attacker to have an account on the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to send a crafted request to the vulnerable function.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the plugin up to and including 2.16.3.3.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 2.16.3.4 by adding a capability check in the `update.php` file for `update_plugins`.
