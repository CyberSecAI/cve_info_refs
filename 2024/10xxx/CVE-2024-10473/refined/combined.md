## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Logo Slider < 4.5.0 - Author+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its Logo Settings when outputing them in pages where the Logo Slider shortcode is embed, which could allow users with a role as low as Author to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

1. Create a logo in the plugin menu
2. Change "Brand Name" field to `123" autofocus onfocus=alert(/XSS/)//`
3. Set any image as the Brand Logo and publish it
4. Create a new Logo Slider via the Shortcode Generator menu of the plugin
5. Add the shortcode to a post and publish it
6. View the post and move the mouse over the image in the slider to trigger the XSS
