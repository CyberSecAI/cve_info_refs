- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its Logo Settings when outputting them in pages where the Logo Slider shortcode is embedded. Specifically, the "Brand Name" field is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the website, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other harmful consequences.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious payload in the "Brand Name" field of a logo within the plugin settings, then embeds the vulnerable shortcode on a post or page. When a user views the post/page, the malicious script executes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have author-level privileges or higher within WordPress.
