- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its Drag & Drop Builder fields.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with high privileges (e.g., admin) can inject malicious JavaScript code through the Drag & Drop Builder fields of the plugin's form creation interface. The XSS payload is then triggered when the form is displayed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user with high privileges such as admin to access the form builder interface.
