## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# ProfilePress < 4.15.15 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its Drag & Drop Builder fields, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Create a new Form at https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=ppress-forms&view=add-new-form
2. Select the Drag & Drop Builder
3. Name the form and then select "Build from Scratch"
4. Edit the "User Login" Field and in "Label" field enter the payload`<img src=x oenrror=alert(1)>`
5. Save the settings and add the form shortcode to a page/post and see the XSS
