- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability exists in the document preview functionality of M-Files Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user input, allowing an authenticated user to specify local file paths through document preview functionality. This leads to reading of sensitive local files, with limited file types, accessible through the server.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated user can read local server files via document preview. The scope of readable files is limited.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network based (AV:N). An authenticated user with low privileges (PR:L) can trigger the vulnerability via the document preview feature without requiring user interaction (UI:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the M-Files Server, and be able to access the document preview function.
