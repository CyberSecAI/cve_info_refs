- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Logo Slider plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input in certain settings, specifically the "Brand Name" field when creating a logo and "Logo Image Height" or "Logo Image Width" when creating a logo slider.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browser of other users when they access the affected settings pages. This could lead to various malicious actions, such as redirecting users to phishing sites, stealing session cookies, or performing administrative actions on their behalf.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with Contributor or higher privileges can inject malicious code into the "Brand Name," "Logo Image Height," or "Logo Image Width" fields through the plugin's settings pages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least Contributor level privileges on the WordPress site to create logos and sliders and inject the malicious code.
