## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Logo Slider < 4.5.0 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its Logo and Slider settings, which could allow high privilege users such as Contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Proof of Concept

Fixed in 4.1.0
1. Create a logo in the plugin menu
2. Change "Brand Name" field to `123" autofocus onfocus=alert(/XSS/)//`
3. Publish/submit for review
4. The XSS will be triggered when any user will edit the logo again
Fixed in 4.5.0
1. Create a new Logo Slider (via the Shortcode Generator menu of the plugin)
2. Put the following payload in the "Logo Image Height" or "Logo Image Width" fields: 123" autofocus onfocus=alert(/XSS/)//
3. Save/Submit for review.
4. The XSS will be triggered when a user will edit the Slider again
