Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `cf7_email_add_on_add_admin_template()` function within the Contact Form 7 Email Add on plugin. This function uses user-supplied input (`template_name` and `template_type`) to construct a file path for inclusion using `include_once`. It does not properly sanitize or validate these inputs, allowing for local file inclusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The plugin is vulnerable to LFI because it includes files based on user-controlled input without proper sanitization or validation.  Specifically the `$_POST['template_name']` variable is used directly in a file path, without sufficient validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary PHP Code Execution:** By crafting a malicious `template_name` input that points to an attacker-controlled PHP file within the server's filesystem, an attacker can force the server to execute that code, allowing for a variety of malicious actions.
*   **Bypass Access Controls:**  Exploiting LFI can allow an attacker to bypass normal access controls, potentially leading to sensitive data exposure.
*   **Sensitive Data Disclosure:**  An attacker could include files containing sensitive information, such as database configuration files, or the content of other PHP files, to gain further access or understanding of the system.
*   **Complete Compromise:** Depending on the file included, an attacker can gain complete control over the WordPress site and the underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack is performed through an HTTP request by sending a malicious payload to the vulnerable `cf7_email_add_on_add_admin_template()` function. The function is hooked to the `wp_ajax_cf7_email_add_on_add_admin_template` and `wp_ajax_nopriv_cf7_email_add_on_add_admin_template` actions, making it accessible via AJAX requests.
*   **`template_name` parameter:** The attacker must manipulate the value of the `template_name` POST parameter to include the path of a malicious file.
*  **`template_type` parameter:** The attacker can choose the `template_type` parameter to target different directories.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as a WordPress user with at least "Contributor" level access. This means that users with limited privileges on a vulnerable WordPress site could potentially exploit this flaw.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Wordfence article highlights that there is no known patch for this vulnerability and recommends either uninstalling the plugin or implementing other mitigation strategies.

This is a critical vulnerability because it allows arbitrary code execution on the server, potentially giving an attacker full control of the target WordPress site.
