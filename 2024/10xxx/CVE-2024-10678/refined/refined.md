- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape block options before outputting them in a page or post where the block is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the victim's browser when they view the affected page/post.
- **Attack vectors:**
    1.  A user with the Contributor role or higher creates a new post.
    2.  The user adds a "Countdown" block to the post.
    3.  The user sets an expiration date/time, and an expiration message.
    4.  The user saves the post, and intercepts the request.
    5.  The user modifies the `expiryMessage` parameter, injecting a payload such as `\\u0026lt;img src=x onerror=alert(1)\\u0026gt;\\u003c`
    6.  When the countdown hits zero, the XSS payload is executed when a user views the page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least Contributor level access in WordPress.
