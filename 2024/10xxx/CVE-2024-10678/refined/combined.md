## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Ultimate Blocks < 3.2.4 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its block options before outputting them back in a page/post where the block is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

1) Create a new Post
2) Add the "Countdown" block
3) Set the expiration date and time to a few minutes in the future
4) Add an expiration message
5) Save and intercept request of submission post and replace the contents of "expiryMessage" with `\\u0026lt;img src=x onerror=alert(1)\\u0026gt;\\u003c`
6) View the page and see the XSS once the countdown hits 0
