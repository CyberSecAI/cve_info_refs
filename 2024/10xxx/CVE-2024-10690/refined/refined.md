Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included when using the `SHORTCODE_ELEMENTOR` shortcode in the "Shortcodes for Elementor" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Information Exposure:** The plugin allows authenticated users with Contributor-level access or higher to access data from private and draft posts created with Elementor that they shouldn't have access to.
*   **Authorization Bypass:** The shortcode does not properly check if the user has permissions to view the content of the post being included via the shortcode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can view the content of private and draft Elementor posts.
*   **Data Leakage:** Sensitive information contained in private or draft posts can be exposed to unauthorized users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Usage:** Attackers can use the `SHORTCODE_ELEMENTOR` shortcode, providing the ID of a private or draft post to extract its content.
*   **Authentication Required:** The attacker needs to have a WordPress user account with at least the "Contributor" role.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress Account:**  The attacker needs a valid WordPress user account with "Contributor" or higher level access.
*   **Knowledge of Post ID:** The attacker needs to know or be able to find the ID of the private or draft Elementor post they want to access.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions of the "Shortcodes for Elementor" plugin up to and including 1.0.4.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.0.5. The fix includes a check to ensure that the post is published and of the `rs_elements` post type before rendering the content.
