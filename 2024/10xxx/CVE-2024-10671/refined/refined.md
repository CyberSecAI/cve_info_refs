Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the `btn_block` shortcode within the Button Block plugin.  Prior to version 1.1.5, the plugin did not perform sufficient checks on post access permissions when rendering the content of a post via the shortcode. It would render the first block of a post, regardless of the post's status (private, draft, password protected) or the user's permissions, if the user had at least contributor level access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Authorization Bypass:** The primary weakness is an authorization bypass. The plugin failed to properly check if the current user had permission to view the content being requested by the shortcode.
*   **Information Exposure:** This bypass resulted in an information exposure vulnerability where authenticated users (Contributor level and above) could potentially access the content of private, password-protected, or draft posts that they normally shouldn't have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers could view the contents of posts intended to be kept private or hidden. This could leak sensitive information stored within these posts.
*   **Bypass Access Control:** The vulnerability enables users to bypass the intended access control mechanisms of WordPress.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Exploitation:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `[btn_block]` shortcode.
*   **Direct Post ID:** An attacker needs to know the ID of the target post to be able to exploit the vulnerability. They can then insert the shortcode with the target post ID anywhere shortcodes are parsed (e.g., posts, pages, widgets).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with at least "Contributor" level privileges or higher.
*   **Knowledge of Target Post ID:** The attacker must know or be able to guess the ID of the post that they wish to access.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.1.5. The fix involves checking if the post exists, if it is password protected, and the post status, checking user permissions to view private posts and edit drafts, before rendering the post.
* The vulnerable code was in the `onBtnBlockAddShortcode` function, which was renamed to `onAddShortcode` and updated with the necessary checks.
* The plugin's `displayContent` function is used to render the post's block after the access check.
