An authenticated user can provide a malformed ACL to the fileserver's StoreACL
RPC, causing the fileserver to crash, possibly expose uninitialized memory, and
possibly store garbage data in the audit log.
Malformed ACLs provided in responses to client FetchACL RPCs can cause client
processes to crash and possibly expose uninitialized memory into other ACLs
stored on the server.
