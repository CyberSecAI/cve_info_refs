Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10316

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control when rendering Elementor templates within the Stratum â€“ Elementor Widgets plugin. Specifically, the plugin was using `get_builder_content` to display template content, which doesn't perform sufficient access control checks.
- The fix involves checking the post status and user capabilities before displaying the content using `get_builder_content_for_display`, ensuring that only published templates or templates that the user has the right to edit are displayed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** The plugin improperly displays unpublished or draft Elementor template content to users with Contributor level access or higher.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers with Contributor-level access or higher can view sensitive information contained within unpublished or draft Elementor templates. This could include confidential text, layouts, images, or other data intended to be private.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have an authenticated user account with at least Contributor level permissions on the WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **WordPress User Account:** The attacker must have a valid WordPress user account with a minimum of "Contributor" privileges.
- **Knowledge of Elementor templates:** The attacker needs to know how to find the templates and that the data can be extracted via the mentioned methods.

**Vulnerable Code Location:**

    - `includes/templates/table.php`

**Additional Details:**

- The patch was introduced in version 1.4.5.
- The vulnerable versions are all versions up to and including 1.4.4.
