Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the lack of input sanitization in the `registration.php` file of an E-Health Care System. Specifically, the `f_name` parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query without any filtering or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By injecting malicious SQL code through the `f_name` parameter, an attacker can manipulate the database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information from the database by crafting appropriate SQL injection payloads. In the provided example, the attacker was able to retrieve the database user: root@localhost
- **Potential Data Modification/Deletion:** SQL injection can also allow attackers to modify or delete data in the database if not properly protected.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `registration.php` file. The vulnerable parameter `f_name` is included in the request body.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No prior access or authentication is needed, since the registration page is publicly available.
- Basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques is required to craft the malicious payload and retrieve information from the database.

**Additional details:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates how to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability using `sqlmap`.
- The vulnerable application is an E-Health Care System written in PHP.
- The vulnerable `registration.php` file is part of the application.
- The provided GitHub link contains a markdown document that details the vulnerability along with the code analysis.
