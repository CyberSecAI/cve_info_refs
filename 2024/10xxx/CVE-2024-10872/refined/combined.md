### Description

The Getwid – Gutenberg Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the `template-post-custom-field` block in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.12 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
