Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10872

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the `template-post-custom-field.php` file of the Getwid plugin. Specifically, the plugin uses `get_post_meta` to retrieve custom field values without proper sanitization, and then outputs it using `echo` without escaping the output, leading to the injection of arbitrary web scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious scripts can be injected into custom fields, which are then rendered on the page, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin doesn't sanitize the custom field values before saving them to the database.
- **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The plugin doesn't properly escape the output of custom field values before rendering them on the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a user's browser who views the compromised page.
- **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could steal cookies and session tokens, potentially leading to account compromise.
- **Malware Distribution:** An attacker can redirect users to malicious websites or inject malware.
- **Defacement:** An attacker can alter the appearance and behavior of the site for any visitor.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker with Contributor or higher level access can create or edit a post or page using the "template-post-custom-field" block.
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript into the custom field value.
- When a user views the post or page, the stored JavaScript is executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have Contributor-level access or higher on the affected WordPress site.
- The attacker must be able to add/edit content and use the affected Getwid plugin block.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Getwid plugin up to and including 2.0.12.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.0.13 by replacing `echo get_post_meta(..)` with `echo wp_kses_post(get_post_meta(..))`. This change ensures the output from the post meta is sanitized.
- The fix was introduced in changeset [3188812](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3188812#file1).
