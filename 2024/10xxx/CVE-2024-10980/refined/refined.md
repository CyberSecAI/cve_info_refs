- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate and escape user-supplied input within the "Cookie Consent" block's options, specifically the "Message" field, before rendering it on a page/post. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious websites, or other attacks depending on the injected script.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attack vector is through the WordPress admin interface via Elementor plugin's "Cookie Consent" block. An attacker with Contributor role or higher can create or edit a post with Elementor and inject malicious script in the message field of the "Cookie Consent" block.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least Contributor-level access to a WordPress site using the vulnerable plugin. They also need the ability to create or edit posts/pages using Elementor.
