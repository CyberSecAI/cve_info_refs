- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the "Add keyword" field of the Squirrly SEO plugin. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script into the field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability could lead to an attacker taking over accounts.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be logged in with "Editor" or higher level privileges to access the plugin interface. The attacker injects the malicious script into the "+ Add keyword" field when creating a post. The XSS is triggered when the page is reloaded in the editor interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have at least editor-level privileges within the WordPress site.
