**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check on the `/wp-json/masteriyo/v1/users/$id` REST API endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing authorization leading to unauthorized user profile modification.
- Privilege escalation vulnerability, where lower-privileged users can modify user roles.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers with student-level access can modify arbitrary user roles, including escalating their privileges to Administrator.
- Attackers can demote existing administrators to student roles, potentially taking full control of the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack using the vulnerable REST API endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user with at least student-level access.
- The attacker needs to send a crafted request to the vulnerable REST API endpoint to exploit the missing authorization check.
