The WPForms – Easy Form Builder for WordPress – Contact Forms, Payment Forms, Surveys, & More plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.1.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the process_admin_ui function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete WPForm logs via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
