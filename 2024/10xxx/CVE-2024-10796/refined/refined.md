Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10796

**Vulnerability:** Information Exposure (Authorization Bypass)

**Root Cause:** The `ifso-show-post` shortcode in the If-So Dynamic Content Personalization plugin lacks sufficient restrictions on which posts can be included. This allows access to private or draft posts that the user should not have access to.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The plugin does not properly check the user's permissions before displaying content from a specified post via the `ifso-show-post` shortcode.
*   **Information Exposure:** The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view the content of private and draft posts, potentially exposing sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker with Contributor-level access or higher can extract data from private or draft posts created with Elementor.
*   This includes sensitive data within the post's content, potentially leading to a data breach.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is exploited through the use of the `ifso-show-post` shortcode.
*   Attackers need to be authenticated users with Contributor-level access or higher.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must have a valid WordPress account with at least Contributor-level privileges.
*   The attacker needs to be able to create/edit content using shortcodes.
*   The attacker does not need to be in a privileged network position.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability exists in all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.9.2.1.
*   The vulnerability is patched in version 1.9.2.2.
*   The vulnerability is related to how the plugin handles the `ifso-show-post` shortcode and how it retrieves and displays post content.
*   The vulnerability is specific to content created with the Elementor page builder, since the plugin uses Elementor's function to retrieve the content.

The provided patch adds checks to ensure the post is not empty, and if the post is not published, the shortcode will not return the content unless the user has the permissions to view it. This ensures that the shortcode will only display content from published posts and when the post is not empty.
