Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The application directly outputs user-supplied data from the `$_POST['searchdata']` parameter into the HTML response without any sanitization or encoding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code, leading to an XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious scripts that can:
    *   Steal cookies or session tokens.
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   Deface the website.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker crafts a malicious payload containing JavaScript code.
*   The attacker submits this payload in the `searchdata` parameter via a POST request to the `search.php` file.
*   The application reflects the unsanitized input back into the HTML, causing the browser to execute the attacker's JavaScript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the vulnerable `search.php` endpoint.
*   The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `searchdata` parameter within the POST request. No authentication is mentioned, so it appears no login is required.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Vulnerable File:** `hms/doctor/search.php`
*  **Vulnerable Parameter:** `searchdata`
*   **Vulnerable Code Snippet:**

    ```php
    if(isset($_POST['search']))
    {
    $sdata=$_POST['searchdata'];
    ?>
    <h4 align="center">Result against "<?php echo $sdata;?>" keyword </h4>
    ```

*   **Demonstration Payload:** `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` or `"></script><script>alert('XSS')</script>` (latter provided in the demonstration section of the github content).
*   The provided content includes images that show the vulnerable search field, how the payload is injected, and the resulting XSS alert.
*   **Mitigation:** The provided content also describes using `htmlspecialchars()` to sanitize the output as a prevention technique.

This vulnerability is more specifically a reflected XSS vulnerability.
