Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10666

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `[etf]` shortcode within the "Easy Twitter Feed â€“ Twitter feeds plugin for WP". This shortcode allows for the extraction of data from password-protected, private, or draft posts that should not be accessible to the user. This indicates an authorization bypass issue where the shortcode doesn't properly check user permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Exposure:** The plugin exposes sensitive information from posts that are meant to be private or restricted.
- **Authorization Bypass:** The shortcode allows users with contributor-level access or higher to bypass the intended access controls and view content they shouldn't have access to.
  
**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An authenticated attacker with contributor-level or higher permissions can gain unauthorized access to the content of password-protected, private, or draft posts. This could lead to data breaches, exposure of sensitive information, or other forms of unauthorized data access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by the use of the `[etf]` shortcode.
- An attacker would need to be an authenticated WordPress user with at least contributor-level access.
- The attacker needs to use the shortcode in a way that reveals the content of posts they should not have access to, possibly by embedding the shortcode in a post or page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user on the vulnerable WordPress site.
- The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access.
- The attacker needs the ability to use the shortcode feature in the site

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.2.6.
- No patch is currently available.
