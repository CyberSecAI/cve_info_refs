Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10759

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw found in the `edit-pig.php` file of the "Farm Management System In PHP v1.0". The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `pigno` parameter before using it in SQL queries.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which occurs because user-supplied data is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper escaping or parameterization.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** Insufficient validation of the `pigno` parameter allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
    *   **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Sensitive data stored in the database can be accessed by the attacker.
    *   **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
    *   **Comprehensive System Control:** Successful exploitation can lead to control of the system.
    *   **Service Interruption:** The vulnerability can be exploited to cause denial-of-service.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a malicious HTTP POST request to the `edit-pig.php` script.
    *   **`pigno` Parameter:** The `pigno` parameter in the POST request is the entry point for injecting malicious SQL code.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable server.
    *   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL to craft malicious payloads.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable File:** `edit-pig.php`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `pigno` (POST request)
*   **Vulnerability Types:**
    *   Time-based blind SQL injection
    *   Boolean-based blind SQL injection
    *   Error-based SQL injection
    *   Stacked queries injection
*   **Payload Examples:** The provided content includes examples of payloads that can be used to exploit the vulnerability. These payloads demonstrate boolean-based, error-based, stacked query, and time-based blind SQL injection techniques.

**Remediation:**

*   **Prepared Statements:** Use prepared statements and parameter binding to separate SQL code from user input.
*   **Input Validation and Filtering:** Validate and filter user input to ensure it conforms to the expected format.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Use database accounts with minimal permissions for database access.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content gives a detailed technical analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability, including multiple proof-of-concept payloads and remediation advice.
*   The attacker can use tools like SQLMap to automate the exploitation of this vulnerability.
