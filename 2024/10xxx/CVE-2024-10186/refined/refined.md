Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10186

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `events_cal` shortcode of the Event Post WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied attributes within the `events_cal` shortcode, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into pages containing the vulnerable shortcode.
- This malicious script executes whenever a user accesses the affected page.
- This can lead to a range of attacks, including session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, and defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the `events_cal` shortcode.
- An attacker injects malicious code as a shortcode attribute value when creating a post or page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** Attackers require at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This means they need an account that has permission to create or edit posts/pages.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the Event Post plugin up to and including 5.9.6.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Peter Thaleikis.
- The vulnerability has been patched in version 5.9.7.
