### Description

The Event post plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's events\_cal shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 5.9.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

## Description

Adds some meta-data to posts to convert them into full calendar events.

Each event can be exported into ical(.ics), outlook(vcs), or Google Calendar.

Geolocation works thanks to openstreetmap.

It can also fetch the weather, but doesn’t bring the sun 🙂

Follow [@wpeventpost](https://twitter.com/wpeventpost) on Twitter for latest news.

## FAQ

### How can I report security bugs?

You can report security bugs through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. The Patchstack team help validate, triage and handle any security vulnerabilities. [Report a security vulnerability.](https://patchstack.com/database/wordpress/plugin/event-post/vdp)

### Is the plugin free ?

Yes, and it uses only open-sources : openstreetmap, openlayer, jquery

### How do I enable weather feature ?

Weather feature uses openweathermap.org api.

You have to create an account and generate an API key at http://openweathermap.org/price

I have no interest in openweathermap.org, I personally use the free plan.

### Is there any limitation for the weather feature ?

Openweathermap.org provides a free plan limited to 60 requests per minute.

You can also subscribe to paid plan, I don’t care.

For many websites with simple event needs, this plugin could be a better approach because it doesn’t require the user to learn an entirely new interface — instead, you just create a post in the usual way and add date and location.
However, the plugin will need more polish to make it a true replacement for dedicated event plugins. The method for adding venue addresses is awkward, and it would help to have a way to store frequently-used addresses.

Thanks for a simple, light, easy plugin. I didn’t want a full event calendar for this project, and this is ideal.
I would suggest simpler documentation for non-devs (like a dedicated admin page with settings, docs etc), and ability to control layout/css in shortcode a bit more, how to add weather, but overall an awesome and light plugin for folks who know some coding.
Thanks.
