The Enter Addons â€“ Ultimate Template Builder for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.9 via the Advanced Tabs widget due to insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract data from private or draft posts created by Elementor that they should not have access to.
