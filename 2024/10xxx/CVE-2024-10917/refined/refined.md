{
  "CVE-2024-10917": {
    "Description": "In Eclipse OpenJ9 versions up to 0.47, the JNI function GetStringUTFLength may return an incorrect value which has wrapped around. From 0.48 the value is correct but may be truncated to include a smaller number of characters.",
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow in JNI function `GetStringUTFLength`.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "CWE-190"
    ],
    "Impact": "The vulnerability may lead to an incorrect length calculation, potentially causing memory corruption or other unexpected behavior if the wrapped around value is used in subsequent operations such as memory allocation or string manipulation.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered via the JNI `GetStringUTFLength` function, which could be called by a malicious or specially crafted application making use of this functionality. The attack vector is network-based.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to be able to influence or control the input to the vulnerable JNI function in order to cause the integer overflow. No specific privileges or user interaction is required."
