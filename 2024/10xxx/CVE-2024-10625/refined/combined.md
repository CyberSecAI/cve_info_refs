### Description

The WooCommerce Support Ticket System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the delete\_tmp\_uploaded\_file() function in all versions up to, and including, 17.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).

## DOCUMENTATION

#### How to automatically update the plugin

To receive automatic updates just install and configure the Envato updater plugin: <https://goo.gl/pkJS33> .The official guide that explains how to configure it can be found at the following link: <https://envato.com/market-plugin> .
#### THE IDEA

WCSTS extends WooCommerce adding a system to manage support tickets. Via WCSTS can be managed three different ticket types:

1. Order tickets: related to orders issues
2. User tickets: related to users issues
3. ***New*** Pay Per Ticket: For more details read the related paragraph

Order and User tickets can be submitted by the user directly via frontend pages. Shop admin can manage tickets using the special backend area.
Furthermore, the plugin allows email notifications, custom texts, and many other customizations to better personalize the system according to the shop admin’s needs!
#### Order tickets

Once activated, the plugin seamlessly adds a **ticket area** in all frontend order details pages (*My Account page* -> *Orders* -> select any order). In this special area, the user can submit new tickets request support for that particular order, read the admin replies for the already submitted tickets, and submit new messages.

Optionally the user can also attach one or more files. Once a ticket is submitted, the customer and the admin can optionally receive a notification email (notification system and attachment by default are disabled. Enable them via the Options menu).

The order ticket system can also be completely disabled or it can be disabled only for the desired order statuses. Just go to the plugin **Options** menu and configure its display settings according to your needs!

**Note:** Guest customers can access the order ticket via the Thank you page. The new ticket notification emails will generate a link to that page by using the {order\_page\_url} shortcode.
#### User tickets

Is automatically displayed on the My Account page in its own tab called **Personal Ticket Area** (text can be customized via the texts menu) and can optionally be
displayed on any frontend page by using the special **[wcsts\_ticket\_area]** shortcode. This ticket type works in the same way as an order ticket for the exception that it is associated with a specific user (the user **must** be logged in to access the ticket area) rather than an order.
Once a ticket is submitted, the customer and the admin can optionally receive a notification email (the notification system by default is disabled. It can be enabled via the Options menu). By using the *open\_new\_ticket* parameter (Example: [wcsts\_ticket\_area open\_new\_ticket=”0”]) you can deny users to open new tickets. The parameter accepts 0 o 1 as values.

**NOTE:** to customize the login message, just use the following format: **[wcsts\_ticket\_area]*Type the message you want to display, html code is accepted*[/wcsts\_ticket\_area]**
#### Pay Per Ticket

The shop manager can now bind to any product (or variant) a number of questions that a user can ask. Once the product is purchased and the order is paid (or marked as completed), the plugin will
automatically open a special **Pay Per Ticket** by which the admin can keep track of the user questions. The product quantity will affect the number of questions that the user will be able to ask. **Note:** if the order contains at least one Pay per ticket product, the regular order ticket opening will be disabled.

To assign the number of questions to a product, just edit it and in the *General* tab you will find an input field name *Questions number*. For variable products, the *Question number* setting will be editable for each variant via the *Variations* tab.

Example:

1. The admin binds 6 questions to Product 1
2. The user buys 2xProduct 1
3. Once the order will be paid, The plugin will open a Pay Per Ticket having 12 questions

The number of questions left can be editable by the admin using the ticket edit page.

The user can buy multiple products having questions bound to them. The plugin will open a ticket for each of them

Pay per ticket area is displayed in the front end by using the special **[wcsts\_pay\_per\_ticket\_area]** shortcode in any page supporting shortcodes. The ticket area will be displayed only for registered users, and non-registered users
will be displayed a login message. To customize the login message, just use the following format: **[wcsts\_pay\_per\_ticket\_area]*Type the message you want to display, html code is accepted*[/wcsts\_pay\_per\_ticket\_area]**

**Note:** if an order is deleted or marked as failed, canceled, or refunded, the associated pay-per-ticket will be deleted too. Once a ticket reaches 0 questions left, the user
will be automatically marked as closed.
Guest customers can access the order ticket via the Thank you page. The new ticket notification emails will generate a link to that page by using the {order\_page\_url} shortcode.

**Note for WooCommerce Subscriptions users:** In the case of a subscription product, every time a renewal occurs, the plugin will reset the pay-per-ticket question number associated with it. The pay-per-ticket will be automatically created according to the order payment status, not the subscription status.

#### File attachment

Optionally you can enable files attachment for reply messages and tickets. You can set the file size limit and configure which file types are accepted. Furthermore, thanks to the “chunk upload” system, the plugin
allows uploading any file size!
#### Use case: File approval system

The ticket system can be used also as a File approval system. Thanks to the **file chunk upload system**, your customers will be able to attach any file size to each ticket (you can, however, limit the number of uploadable files, size, and types).
You can then reject the upload(s) by simply replying to the ticket (optionally the user will be notified via email) and eventually attaching files to your reply.

Each message will have its own attachments (that can be eventually deleted) to keep track of the attachment history!
#### Predefined answers

Would you like to define a set of predefined answers that can be later recalled when managing a ticket? You can! Just access the **Predefined answers** menu and create them!
Those answers will be available to all the admins that will be lately answering the ticket!
#### Rich text and Tiny MCE on Frontend

Optionally you can also enable the Tiny MCE editor for frontend ticket text areas! In this way, your customers will be able to enter rich texts!

To enable this option just go into the plugin options menu and enable the **Enable Tiny mce editor for ticket message area on frontend** option.
#### Backend managment

The shop admin via the backend Ticket system management area will be able to keep track of all the submitted tickets. In the ticket list table, the shop admin can at once retrieve
the following info:

1. Type: can be *Order* or *User*. It is needed to identify if the ticket is associated with a specific order or to a specific user
2. Associated User/Order id
3. Status: It can be Open, In Progress, or Closed
4. Priority: priorities can be customized using the special menu
5. New message counter: it helps to better identify if a user replied to a ticket
6. Subject: ticket subject
7. Ticekt open date
8. Ticekt last user reply date

Deleting a ticket, the system will delete all its related meta info including attachments! In this way, your server and your DB will be always clean!

Clicking on a ticket, the Admin can edit its info, read customer personal data, download (and delete) attachments, and reply to the user. On ticket details, the page can be also overridden the notification emails recipient(s)
#### Assign ticket to specific admin users for better management

Optionally you can assign tickets to specific admins users (that have **edit\_posts** capability) and notify them. You can also optionally filter their ticket list to display only tickets assigned to them.
To do that, just go to the options menu and set the **Display all tickets to non Administrator users (admin area)** according to your needs.

By selecting the “display all tickets” option, the admins will be able to filter the list displaying only the ticket assigned to them (at the top of the ticket list they will find a filter to do that).

**NOTE:** *Administrator* users will be able always to see all the tickets.
#### Custom statuses

Besides the default Open, In progress, and Closed ticket statuses, the shop admin can define his own custom statuses!
#### Automatic order tickets

WCSTS plugin allows you to create tickets automatically each time the order hits a particular status! In addition, you can set up the first message to automatically include when the ticket is created.
#### Options & customizations

The plugin allows the shop admin many customizations, such as:

1. User/Order ticket subject type: The subject can be an open text (with length limit) or a select menu by which the user has to select one of the preselected topics (Use the text menu to configure them)
2. Messages and subject length limit
3. Disable order ticket system: disabling the ticket area will no longer be shown on every order details page. The shop admin will be still able to display the User
   ticket area using the **[wcsts\_ticket\_area]** shortcode
4. Attachments: enable attachments, number of attachable files, size, and types
5. Email notification system: enable disable user and/or admin notifications
6. Display ticket status on frontend
7. Allow users to assign a priority to the just created ticket

#### Texts Customizations

The shop admin can customize the following texts:

1. New ticket description: displayed on the new ticket box. It could contain various info, like ticket average processing times
2. New ticket “successfully submitted” message: This message is displayed after a ticket has been successfully submitted by the user
3. Notification emails subject and body: All email subjects and messages can be customized. Furthermore can be used special place holder like {subject}, {message}, {ticket\_id}
   to embed dynamic content about the current ticket message.

#### WPML

The plugin is compatible with WPML. To translate dynamic texts, just go to the Text menu, switch languages using the WPML language selector, and input a text. In the case of
preselected topics, **Remember** to create the translations for each language.
