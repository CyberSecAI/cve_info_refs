## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Download Manager < 3.3.03 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to https://example.com/wp-admin/edit.php?post\_type=wpdmpro&page=wpdm-settings&tab=wpdmui
2. Scroll down to the section where you can customize the appearance, specifically look for the "Color" settings or a "Primary" color field.
3. In the "Primary" color field, insert the following XSS payload: `" style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//`
4. Save Settings
5. Reload the page the trigger the XSS
