{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a missing check for an empty 'api_key' value within the `perform` function of the RemoteCalls class. This allows an attacker to bypass authentication by providing an empty value in the `spbc_remote_call_token` parameter and still trigger remote call actions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Authorization Bypass",
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to install and activate arbitrary plugins, which may lead to remote code execution if a vulnerable plugin is installed/activated.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request containing a specific remote call action and an empty `spbc_remote_call_token` parameter to the vulnerable WordPress site.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any authentication or special capabilities to exploit the vulnerability. Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter and target action is required."
  },
  "cve": "CVE-2024-10781",
  "details": "The provided content includes a code excerpt from the `RemoteCalls.php` file of the CleanTalk plugin, showing the vulnerable code. It also includes the plugin's changelog, mentioning the fix for this vulnerability. The Wordfence article provides further information about this vulnerability, including the CVSS score and exploitation details. This confirms the vulnerability is related to this CVE, the missing check on api_key in perform method, and the ability to bypass access control"
