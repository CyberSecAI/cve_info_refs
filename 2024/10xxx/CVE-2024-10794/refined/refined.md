Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included via the `bhf` shortcode in the Boostify Header Footer Builder for Elementor plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Information Exposure:** The plugin allows authenticated users to access content from private or draft posts that they should not have access to. This is due to the lack of proper access controls when processing the `bhf` shortcode.
*   **Authorization Bypass:** The vulnerability effectively bypasses the intended authorization checks, allowing contributors and higher-level users to extract data from restricted posts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Information Disclosure:** Attackers can access sensitive information within private or draft posts, potentially revealing confidential or incomplete content.
*   **Privacy Violation:** Exposure of drafts and private content can lead to privacy breaches and data leaks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the `bhf` shortcode. By using this shortcode, authenticated users can trigger the vulnerability and potentially retrieve unauthorized content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user on the WordPress site.
*   **User Level:** The attacker needs at least Contributor-level access or higher, indicating a low privilege attacker is required.
*   **Shortcode Utilization:** The attacker must be able to utilize the `bhf` shortcode within the WordPress environment.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was found by Francesco Carlucci.
*   The plugin version affected is <= 1.3.6
*   The patched version is 1.3.7
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on November 12, 2024.
*   The fix was implemented by limiting the shortcode usage to only administrators.
