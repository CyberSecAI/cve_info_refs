- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The PostgreSQL libpq client library does not properly validate error messages received from the server, allowing a man-in-the-middle attacker to inject arbitrary non-NULL bytes into the client application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness lies in the libpq client's trust of server-provided error messages. It does not properly sanitize or validate the content, allowing a malicious server to send data that is interpreted as valid data by the client.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful man-in-the-middle attack could result in a client (e.g., psql) displaying arbitrary text as query results when an error occurs, potentially misleading users. Although no confidentiality or availability impact is noted, this could result in a low level of integrity issues by misleading the user of the application.
- **Attack vectors:** A man-in-the-middle attacker positioned between the client and the PostgreSQL server can intercept and modify the server's error response, injecting malicious or misleading text.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and manipulate network traffic between the client and server. This is described as a "man-in-the-middle" attack. Additionally, the attack requires a user to interpret the misleading information as valid query results, as this vulnerability relies on social engineering rather than direct technical exploitation.
