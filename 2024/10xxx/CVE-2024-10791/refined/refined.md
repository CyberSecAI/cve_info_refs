The provided content is related to CVE-2024-10791.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `docterAction.php` file. This is due to the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input from the "Username" parameter. This parameter is directly used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is the injection of malicious SQL code through the "Username" parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized database access
- Sensitive data leakage
- Data tampering
- Comprehensive system control
- Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `docterAction.php` file with a malicious payload in the "Username" parameter. The "branch" parameter is also present in the requests, but it does not seem to be related to the vulnerability itself.
-  No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker doesn't need any prior authentication or authorization.

**Additional details:**
- The issue was discovered during a security review of the "Hospital Appointment System In PHP With Source Code."
- The vulnerability can be exploited using boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based blind SQL injection techniques.
- The provided payload examples demonstrate how to exploit these different injection techniques.
- SQLMap was used to verify the vulnerability.
- Suggested repairs include using prepared statements, input validation, minimizing database user permissions, and regular security audits.
