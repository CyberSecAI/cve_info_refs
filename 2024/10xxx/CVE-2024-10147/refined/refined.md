Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10147

**Vulnerability:** Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `btn` shortcode of the Steel WordPress plugin. This allows attackers to inject malicious web scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-provided input before processing it.
*   **Lack of Output Escaping:** The plugin fails to properly escape output, allowing injected scripts to be executed by the browser.
*   **Stored XSS:** The malicious script is stored in the database and executed whenever a user views the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
*   These scripts will execute in the browsers of users who visit the affected page. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Data theft
    *   Other malicious actions

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered via the `btn` shortcode functionality in the Steel plugin.
*   Attackers can inject malicious scripts through user-supplied attributes of the `btn` shortcode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
*   **Ability to Create/Edit Posts/Pages:** The attacker must have the ability to create or edit content (posts or pages) where they can insert the malicious `btn` shortcode.

**Additional Notes:**
* The plugin has been closed and is no longer available for download on the WordPress plugin directory.
* No patch is currently available. Users of the plugin are advised to remove it.
* The vulnerability was discovered by Francesco Carlucci.
* The affected versions are all versions of the Steel plugin up to and including version 1.3.0.
