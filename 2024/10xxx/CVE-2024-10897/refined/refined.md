Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization check in the `install_etlms_dependency_plugin()` function within the Tutor LMS Elementor Addons plugin. This function is responsible for installing dependent plugins (Tutor LMS or Elementor).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Authorization Check:** The primary weakness is the absence of a capability check before allowing users to execute the `install_etlms_dependency_plugin()` function. This allows users with lower privileges (Subscriber level and above) to trigger the installation of plugins.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Plugin Installation:**  Authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access (or higher) can install the Tutor LMS or Elementor plugins. While the impact is limited because these are likely dependencies, it still constitutes unauthorized access and the ability to install plugins without proper admin level permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely through the WordPress admin interface.
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a valid user account on the target WordPress site with at least "subscriber" privileges.
- The attacker needs to craft a request to trigger the `install_etlms_dependency_plugin` function.

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability was present in versions of the plugin up to and including 2.1.5
- The vulnerability has been patched in version 2.1.6.
- The patch added a nonce check `tutor_utils()->checking_nonce();` and a capability check `current_user_can('manage_options')` before allowing plugin installation. This ensures that only users with the 'manage_options' capability (typically administrators) can install plugins.
- The provided code snippets show the vulnerable code and the fix introduced in changeset 3186320.
