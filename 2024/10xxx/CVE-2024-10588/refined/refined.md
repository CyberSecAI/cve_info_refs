- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization check on the `info()` function within the Debug Tool plugin for WordPress.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authorization, information exposure.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access and above can obtain sensitive information from `phpinfo()`. When `WP_DEBUG` is enabled, unauthenticated users can also exploit this vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Authenticated users with subscriber-level access or higher, and unauthenticated users if `WP_DEBUG` is enabled.
