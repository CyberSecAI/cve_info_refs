Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing capability check in the `ajax_install_plugin()` function within the `Cross.php` file of the WP Chat App plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Authorization Check:** The `ajax_install_plugin()` function lacks a proper check to verify if the user initiating the plugin installation has the necessary `install_plugins` capability.
*   **Insecure AJAX Endpoint:** The AJAX endpoint for plugin installation was accessible to any authenticated user, regardless of their role/capabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Plugin Installation:** An attacker with minimal privileges (Subscriber level and above) can exploit this vulnerability to install arbitrary plugins on the WordPress site. This can lead to a variety of malicious actions depending on the plugin installed.
*   **Site Compromise:** The attacker could install a plugin that allows for arbitrary code execution, leading to complete site takeover, data breaches, or defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is triggered via an AJAX request.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs a valid account on the WordPress site, with at least Subscriber-level access.
*   **Knowledge of AJAX Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know or guess the AJAX endpoint associated with the vulnerable `ajax_install_plugin()` function.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in versions of the WP Chat App plugin up to and including 3.6.8.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 3.6.9 by adding the missing capability check to the `ajax_install_plugin()` function.
*   The vulnerable code is in the `includes/Cross.php` file.
*   The `pluginInstaller()` function is called after the check_ajax_referer() check.

This is more detailed than the CVE description which just states "The WP Chat App plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized plugin installation due to a missing capability check on the ajax\_install\_plugin() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to install the filebird plugin."
