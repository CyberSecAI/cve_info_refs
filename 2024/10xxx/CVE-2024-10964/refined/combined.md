### **[Redpeppersir](/Redpeppersir)** commented [Nov 1, 2024](#issue-2628400071)

| **Buffer Overflow in strcpy(1) handle\_add\_plugin** File: plugins/restful/plugin\_handle.c  The /api/v2/plugin interface library parameter uses the strcpy function to copy the contents of req->library to cmd.library. This operation poses a risk of buffer overflow since the strcpy function does not check the size of the destination buffer. If the string length in req->library exceeds the capacity of cmd.library, strcpy will continue writing beyond the memory of the destination buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.
