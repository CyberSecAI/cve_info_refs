The provided content relates to CVE-2024-10973.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The environment option `KC_CACHE_EMBEDDED_MTLS_ENABLED` in Keycloak does not work as intended. Consequently, the JGroups replication configuration is always used in plain text, despite the intention to encrypt it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Failure to properly enable encryption for JGroups communication.
- Exposure of sensitive information due to the use of plain text for JGroups replication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker with access to adjacent networks related to JGroups could potentially read sensitive information transmitted through the unencrypted JGroups communication.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks, specifically targeting adjacent networks related to JGroups.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to networks adjacent to the Keycloak instance's JGroups communication.
