Great plugin and the author is very kind to help us fix the incompatibility with other plugins. God WordPress lives here! 🙂

Доброго дня!
Отличный плагин для работы. Спасибо.
Добавлю пару замечаний. Не работает в карточке товара (всплывающая форма товара, быстрый просмотр). А также нет возможности кастомизировать дизайн формы. Уж очень он убог 😉
В целом отлично. Спасибо!

Lots of settings. Works correctly. You can edit the design. Fast support.

Хотелось бы видеть отправку на свой email уведомлений о поступившей заявки, после заполнения формы на обычную почту от яндекса и т.п, а не через сторонние сервисы

Does not work fully with loco translate. Some parts of the quick order form can not be translated with loco translate and translate press. I translated them on the backend files but when I update the plugin they revert back to English. I submitted the proper translations but they are not working yet…
