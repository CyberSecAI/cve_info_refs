Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10175

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied attributes within the `wdo_pricing_tables` shortcode of the "Pricing Tables For WPBakery Page Builder" plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS because it doesn't properly sanitize user inputs, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Web Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. When a user accesses a page containing the injected script, the script will execute in their browser, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Malware distribution
    *   Defacement
    *   Data theft
    *   Redirecting the user to malicious websites
*  The vulnerability allows for the potential for an attacker to escalate their privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the `wdo_pricing_tables` shortcode. An attacker can insert malicious scripts as attribute values when using this shortcode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with at least Contributor-level access or above. This level of access allows the attacker to create or edit posts and pages, where they can insert the malicious shortcode.

**Additional Details:**
* The plugin has been closed as of November 26, 2024 and is not available for download
* There is no patch available as of the date of the provided information. The recommendation is to uninstall the plugin.
