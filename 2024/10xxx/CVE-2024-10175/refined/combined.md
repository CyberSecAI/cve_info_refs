### Description

The Pricing Tables For WPBakery Page Builder (formerly Visual Composer) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's wdo\_pricing\_tables shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

I just needed something simple. Tables are nice and neat but I cannot change color or wordings. The Pro version is only five bucks and I would gladly pay that if I know it works

### [Not the same as the demo](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/not-the-same-as-the-demo/)

Two stars (rather than one) because the plugin does technically work, but the 5 styles the plugin comes with are 100% NOT the styles shown in the demo. To access any of those styles you must purchase the upgrade. The tables work fine – though you cannot see them in the wpbakery editor as far as I can tell if you are using the front-end editor, but the styles shown in the demo versus what comes with the plugin are night and day. The styles in this plugin are not as sophisticated as the demo styles, having spacing issues, and I wonder if they are really by the same author.
Overall disappointing and will be uninstalling.
