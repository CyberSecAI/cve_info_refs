Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:**
- The `doedit.php` file in the Events-Management-System does not properly sanitize or validate the `id` parameter before using it in an SQL query. The `id` parameter is directly concatenated into the SQL query, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Lack of input sanitization: The application does not sanitize the 'id' parameter before using it in SQL query, allowing the attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- Direct concatenation of user-supplied data:  The 'id' parameter is directly concatenated into the SQL query, a classic vulnerability pattern.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Sensitive information disclosure: Attackers can use SQL injection to retrieve sensitive information from the database, potentially including usernames, passwords, personal data, or other confidential details.
- Database manipulation: The attacker could potentially modify data within the database, insert malicious data, or even delete database contents
- Full system compromise: With successful exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities, complete compromise of the system may be possible in some cases.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `doedit.php` with a crafted `id` parameter in the request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker doesn't necessarily need to be logged in, as the vulnerability is present even without login.
- Basic understanding of SQL is required to craft SQL injection payloads.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable application's URL (`doedit.php`) and the parameter name (`id`).

**Technical Details from the provided text:**

- Vulnerable file: `doedit.php`
- Vulnerable parameter: `id`
- The provided Proof-of-Concept (POC) uses a `POST` request to `dodelete.php` and parameter `id` which is slightly different from description.
- The database name obtained with sqlmap is `healthcare`.
- sqlmap is used as a tool to test and exploit the vulnerability, although that is not the actual vector.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present even when the user isn't logged in.
- The provided text also mentions `dodelete.php`, but the main vulnerability described is in `doedit.php` and the sqlmap PoC uses `dodelete.php`.
- The included images show the successful extraction of the database name.
- The `sql16.md` document within the github repository documents this vulnerability for "Events-Management-system"
