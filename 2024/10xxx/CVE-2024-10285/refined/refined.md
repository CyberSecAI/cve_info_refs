{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The CE21 Suite plugin stores JWT tokens in a publicly accessible log file (`plugin-log.txt`).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Sensitive information disclosure",
        "Insecure storage of JWT tokens"
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthenticated attackers can obtain JWT tokens from the log file and use them to log in as any user associated with the token, potentially gaining administrative access.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can directly access the publicly available `plugin-log.txt` file.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any special capabilities or prior access, but needs to know the location of `plugin-log.txt` on the server."
