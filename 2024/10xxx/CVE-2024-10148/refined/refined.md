**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10148

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the "Awesome buttons" WordPress plugin when handling user-supplied attributes in the `btn2` shortcode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize or escape user-provided input within the `btn2` shortcode, allowing for the injection of malicious web scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is through the `btn2` shortcode of the "Awesome buttons" plugin.
*   An attacker inserts malicious JavaScript code within the attributes of the `btn2` shortcode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have at least "contributor-level" access to the WordPress site to inject content with the shortcode.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerable plugin is "Awesome buttons" version 1.0 and below.
*   The plugin has been closed as of October 21, 2024 due to this security issue.
