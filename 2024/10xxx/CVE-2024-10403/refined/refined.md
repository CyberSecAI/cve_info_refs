- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The SFTP/FTP server password used for firmware downloads is stored in memory and can be captured in a weblinker core dump generated after a crash.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Sensitive password information is stored in memory without proper sanitization, leading to exposure via core dumps.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker who obtains a core dump (supportsave) can extract the SFTP/FTP password, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the server where firmware files are stored.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs access to the supportsave file containing the core dump. The core dump is generated due to the crash of the weblinker daemon after an SFTP/FTP transfer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the supportsave file which is generated on the vulnerable system after the weblinker daemon crashes.
