### Description

The Top Store theme for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized arbitrary plugin installation due to a missing capability check on the top\_store\_install\_and\_activate\_callback() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to install arbitrary plugins which can contain other exploitable vulnerabilities to elevate privileges and gain remote code execution.
