- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate and escape block options before outputting them in a page or post where the block is embedded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will execute in the context of the victim's browser when they view a page containing the crafted block. This could lead to a variety of attacks such as session hijacking, account takeover, defacement or further malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: A user with the contributor role or above can create or edit a post with Elementor, insert a "Lightbox" block and input a malicious payload (e.g. `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>123`) into the "Lightbox Content > Content Caption" setting. When the post is viewed, the XSS payload is executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs at least a contributor role on the WordPress site. They must be able to create or edit posts with Elementor, specifically to be able to add and modify the Lightbox block with malicious input.
