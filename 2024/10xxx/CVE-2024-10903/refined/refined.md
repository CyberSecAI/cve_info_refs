- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not validate link URLs before making a request to them.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability due to lack of URL validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Admin users can perform SSRF attacks, potentially targeting internal services or other resources on the network. On a multisite installation, this could be particularly damaging.
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating the URL associated with a link within a post and triggering a recheck via the plugin's interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires an administrator-level account on the WordPress instance.
