## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Broken Link Checker < 2.4.2 - Admin+ SSRF

### Description

The plugin does not validate a the link URLs before making a request to them, which could allow admin users to perform SSRF attack, for example on a multisite installation.

### Proof of Concept

1. Add a link to a post. Save and publish it.
2. Visit `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=blc\_local&filter\_id=all`.
3. Find the URL that was added to the post and click "Edit URL".
4. Change the URL to `http://localhost:8000` and click Update.
5. Start a web service on the same server as the WordPress site, e.g. `python3 -m http.server`
6. On the WordPress site, click on "Recheck" for the added URL. You should see a request come into the local web service.
