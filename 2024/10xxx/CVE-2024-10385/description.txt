Ticket management system in DirectAdmin Evolution Skin is vulnerable to XSS (Cross-site Scripting), which allows a low-privileged user to inject and store malicious JavaScript code.
If an admin views the ticket, the script might perform actions with their privileges, including command execution. 
This issue has been fixed in version 1.668 of DirectAdmin Evolution Skin.
