The WP Travel Engine – Tour Booking Plugin – Tour Operator Software plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the wpte_onboard_save_function_callback() function in all versions up to, and including, 6.2.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to modify several settings that could have an impact such as lost revenue and page updates.
