Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization check in the `wpte_onboard_save_function_callback()` function within the WP Travel Engine plugin. This function is responsible for saving plugin settings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of a proper capability check within the `wpte_onboard_save_function_callback()` function. This allows users with lower privileges than intended to access and modify plugin settings.
- The code checks for `manage_options` capability, but this check is not performed before the nonce verification, which allows lower-privileged users to bypass this check and trigger the function.
- Insufficient permission checks are present, allowing authenticated users with contributor-level access or higher to modify settings, even though they should not have the permission to do so.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized settings modification:** Attackers can modify plugin settings which may result in lost revenue and page updates.
- **Potential data manipulation:** Modifying critical settings could lead to unexpected behavior on the website, including impacting pricing, tour availability and other important data within the plugin.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The vulnerability is reachable over the network.
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have an authenticated account on the WordPress site with at least contributor-level access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated WordPress user:** The attacker needs an account on the WordPress site with at least contributor-level permissions.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was present in versions up to and including 6.2.1 of the WP Travel Engine plugin.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 6.2.2
- The vulnerability allows attackers with contributor-level permissions and above to modify plugin settings.
- The CVSS score is 4.3 (Medium).
