Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10015

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the ConvertCalculator for WordPress plugin. Specifically, the 'id' and 'type' parameters are not properly handled, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to Stored XSS due to the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages.
*   When a user accesses an injected page, the malicious script will execute, potentially leading to:
    *   Cookie theft
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Other malicious activities, based on the attacker's injected code

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is exploited through the 'id' and 'type' parameters of the plugin.
*   Attackers inject malicious scripts through these parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site.

**Summary**
The ConvertCalculator for WordPress plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS due to unsanitized input in the 'id' and 'type' parameters. An attacker with contributor access or higher can inject malicious scripts that will execute when other users access pages containing the injected code. The vulnerability is present in versions 1.1.1 and below, and is fixed in version 1.1.2.
