**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization and validation in the `checkWithoutToken` function.
- There's an authorization bypass via reverse DNS spoofing, which is also related to the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command ('SQL Injection').
- Authorization bypass through reverse DNS spoofing.
- Insufficient input sanitization and validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthenticated attackers can inject additional SQL queries into existing queries.
- Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks, exploiting the vulnerable `checkWithoutToken` function.
- Reverse DNS spoofing is used to bypass authorization checks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable endpoint with a spoofed reverse DNS record.
- The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to perform the attack.
