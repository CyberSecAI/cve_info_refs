Below is a list of enhancements and fixes.

**Enhancements:**

1. Revamped the Booking meta box in the admin product page.

2. Earlier we had 8 tabs. The settings from all those tabs have been moved into 5 tabs.

3. We’ve introduced a Booking Type field. Earlier, the type was decided based on other settings enabled.

4. The broader classification for the Booking Type is Only Days and Date & Time. Only Days is further classified as Single Days and Multiple Nights (earlier known as Allow Multiple Day Booking).

5. We’ve also introduced the ability to enable/disable weekdays for multiple day bookings. Earlier no settings were available for the same. It was done using a hook. The hook is still present and will continue to function as is.

6. Added a setting to allow the admin to setup the maximum number of bookable nights for multiple day bookings.

7. Earlier, we allowed the admin to create only 1 fixed bookable range. This has been modified, you can create as many bookable ranges as you please.

8. We have even introduced the ability to create ranges using month names. The range will start on the first day of the start month and end on the last day of the end month.

9. You can even create a holiday range now. This can be done by creating a range and setting Bookable OFF.

10. We have added a Save Changes button for each tab. So you can save your changes as you go.

11. We have beautified the front end product page display of the booking fields.

12. All the required fields stay in a box with necessary information displayed at all times making it a smoother experience for the end user.

13. The calendar icon has now been placed inside the date fields.

14. Earlier all the booking settings were saved in a single post meta record ‘woocommerce\_booking\_settings’. We have started saving the settings as individual records as well. We will continue to maintain the serialized record as well as the individual records as of now. However, the plan is to remove the serialized record all together in one of the next few updates.

15. Each booking will now be created as a post with the post type bkap\_booking. The booking data will be saved in the postmeta table.

16. Modified the css for the global booking settings i.e. Booking->Settings page. The settings on the page have not been modified.

17. Added a setting to remove the calendar icon on the front end booking fields.

**Issue fixes:**

1. When an AirBnB calendar is set for import, the events from the calendar are imported repeatedly as AirBnB provides a dynamic UID. This has been fixed by using the Booking Reference Number instead of the UID.

2. When an event is mapped to a variable product which had attribute level lockout data setup (but was later on removed). The plugin creates the order, but does not update the availability. This has been fixed.

3. Fixed an issue where the Check Booking Availability payment gateway is not displayed at Checkout when the language is changed after adding the product to the cart.

4. It was possible to over-book a product for the same dates (multiple day booking) when the product is added to the cart twice and the quantity is increased on the Cart page. The same has been fixed.

5. Restored the plugin compatibility with WooCommerce Product Addons which was broken since WooCommerce 3.0.0 release.

6. Fixed an issue where the Grand Total is displayed 0 on the product page for WooCommerce Product Addons.

7. Restored the plugin compatibility with Gravity Forms Product Addons which was again broken since WooCommerce 3.0.0 release.

8. When Multiple Time Slots addon is enabled, the user is unable to add a product to the cart with the current date and time slots. The same has been fixed.

9. Made the text ‘Please choose an option’ available for translation.

10. Range prices were calculated incorrectly when the attributes were set in Russian language. Fixed the same.

11. When a search is run in the plugin widget where the end date is left blanks, it sets the end date to today’s date even if the start date is a later date. This has been fixed by assigning the start date to the end date. So a search will be run for 1 day.

#### Changelog for v3.5.4(Release: April 25 2017)

This is a minor update to the plugin which contains some issue fixes related to WooCommerce 3.0.0 update.

1. Fixed an issue where the bookings go missing from the View Bookings page and no booking details are captured for products that contain HTML tags in the product name.

2. Fixed a backward compatibility issue for lower versions of WooCommerce where a fatal error is thrown at Checkout when using automated GCal sync.

#### Changelog for v3.5.3(Release: April 21 2017)

This update to the plugin contains some bug fixes related to WooCommerce 3.0.x update which were found after the last release.

3. Fixed a backward compatibility issue where an Internal Server Error is thrown for Booking->View Bookings->Calendar listing.

4. A fatal error is displayed on the View Bookings page when the order currency is not found. Fixed this by using the WooCommerce currency for such instances.

6. Incorrect dates are selected for a product when the dates are being duplicated from the product already present in the Cart. This happens when the Rental Addon is active. The same has been fixed.

#### Changelog for v3.5.2(Release: April 4 2017)

This update to the plugin mainly contains compatibility fixes for WooCommerce 3.0.0 along with some minor bug fixes.

4. When a variable product which has a default variation selected is added to the cart without selecting any booking details, the product price defaults to 0. This has been fixed.

5. Fixed an issue where the booking price is not updated on the Product page when one or more attributes are changed but the date is not modified.

6. The Import bookings page shows incorrect booking date for events that are imported from the calendars that have a timezone set to UTC – hours. This has now been fixed.

7. When an event is exported to Google Calendar for a product using multiple day bookings, the Checkout Date is shown booked for the entire day. This has now been modified by ensuring the end date is not shown booked.

8. The View Bookings page was sorting the records only for the current page for any given column. This has been fixed to ensure all the records are considered when sorting.

9. The plugin allowed to add attribute values for simple products in the Price By Range tab. The plugin now ensures this is not possible as the price ranges cannot be different for different attributes for simple products.

#### Changelog for v3.5.1(Release: February 27 2017)

This update to the plugin contains a few bug fixes.

1. Fixed an issue where the price was displayed as 0 when an only day bookable product that can be purchased without choosing a date is added to the cart after selecting a booking date.

3. Fixed an issue where the user is unable to add a product to the cart after selecting the date & time once and then changing the desired booking date.

4. For a product that requires confirmation, if the admin approves the booking, an event is added to the google calendar of the admin (provided automated sync is enabled). In the same scenario if the admin rejects the booking, the booking date/s and/or times are made re-available for booking. This functionality had broken and has now been fixed.

2. Bundled Products can now be made bookable. A maximum cap can be set on the bundle and all the child products.

3. The plugin now allows the New Booking and New GCal Event Imported emails found in WooCommerce->Settings->Emails to be sent to multiple recipients.

4. Added the default value ‘CITY’ for Booking->Settings->Google Calendar Sync->Event Location. This will be applicable only for a fresh installation of the plugin. No changes have been made for updating users.

**Issues Fixed:**

1. Made some minor css changes for the Booking Widget on the front end for a better appearance.

2. When the Booking plugin is used in conjunction with the Multiple Time Slots addon, the plugin does not free up all the slots booked when an order is cancelled or refunded. This has now been fixed.

3. In a scenario where an order contains more than one bookable variable product, the attribute values for both the products are being displayed in each others qtip events in Booking->View Bookings->Calendar View. This has now been fixed.

4. Fixed an issue where the Add to Cart button and quantity buttons are displayed on the front end product page when the product uses fixed blocks and the user selects the dates once and then changes the selection in the fixed block drop down. This results in the user being able to add the product to the cart even when no dates are selected.

5. When new fixed blocks or price ranges were added in the admin product page immediately after using the ‘Delete All’ link, the newly added records were not being displayed unless the page was refreshed. This has now been fixed.

6. Fixed an issue where incorrect attribute values were being updated in the database tables when price ranges were edited for variable products.

7. The booking prices were not being displayed on the front end product page when the attribute values were in other languages like Chinese etc. This has now been fixed.

8. Fixed an issue where booking prices were calculated incorrectly when the product uses price ranges set for each day. For e.g. 1-1, 2-2 and so on.

9. When the Booking plugin is being used in conjunction with the Rental System Addon and the Flat Charge per day setting is enabled, the plugin does not block the Checkout date once lockout is reached. This has now been fixed.

10. Fixed an issue where lockout is set at the variation level and even though the number of bookings received for the given variation matches the lockout value set, the dates are being shown as available for booking.

11. Fixed a warning which is displayed when a search is performed in Booking->View Bookings using the custom filter.

12. In a scenario where Lockout Date after X order is left blanks and the product uses date and time bookings with a lockout value set for each time slot, dates are being made unavailable for booking as soon as the lockout value is reached for any one slot. This has now been fixed.

13. In a scenario where the booking plugin is used with the WooCommerce Product Addons plugin or the Gravity Forms Addon, the booking price is being shown just above the Add to Cart button. This is confusing for the end user as different total amounts are being shown from the booking plugin and the addon plugins. This has been fixed by ensuring that the booking price is displayed just below the booking fields when the total bookable price is being charged. However, the plugin still continues to show the booking price at the bottom when used with the Partial Deposits Addon.

14. When the plugin is updated from a lower version, the Product page, Cart & Checkout page and email labels in Booking->Labels & messages tab are going blanks. This issue occurs for users who have installed the plugin starting from version 2.8 to 3.4. This has now been fixed. No labels will go blanks for any users after updating the plugin.

15. Fixed an issue where the addon prices (for WooCommerce Product Addons) were not being charged on a per day basis even though the Booking->Settings->Global Booking Settings->Charge WooCommerce Product Addons options on a Per Day Basis was set to on.

16. The Add to Cart and Quantity buttons were displayed as enabled on product page load when Booking->Settings->Global Booking Settings->Always display the Add to Cart and Quantity buttons was enabled. This has now been fixed to ensure that the buttons are not enabled unless the booking details are entered.

8. In WooCommerce->Order->Add Order, if a bookable product is being added to the order, the datepicker always displayed ‘Smoothness’ theme. This has now been modified to ensure the datepicker uses the theme set in Booking->Settings->Global Booking Settings->Calendar Theme.
