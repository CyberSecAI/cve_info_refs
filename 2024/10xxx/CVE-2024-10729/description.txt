The Booking & Appointment Plugin for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'save_google_calendar_data' function in versions up to, and including, 6.9.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions or above to update the site options arbitrarily.
