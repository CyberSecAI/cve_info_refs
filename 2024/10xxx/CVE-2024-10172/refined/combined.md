### Description

The WPBakery Visual Composer WHMCS Elements plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's void\_wbwhmcse\_laouts\_search shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

Works fine, looks good, but….. i do missing the option to open link (search button) in target=blank.
I also get an error since using this plugin:
WP\_Scripts::localize was called incorrectly. The $l10n parameter must be an array.
