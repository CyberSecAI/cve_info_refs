Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10856

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of the `id` parameter within the `wpdevart_booking_calendar` shortcode. This lack of proper input validation and sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries via this parameter. The vulnerability is triggered when the “delete_prev_date” theme option is enabled within the Booking Calendar WpDevArt plugin.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input (specifically, the `id` parameter) before incorporating it into an SQL query.
*   **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The existing SQL query does not use prepared statements, which are crucial for preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to extract sensitive data from the WordPress database. This could include user passwords, personal information, or other confidential data, depending on the specific SQL queries executed by the attacker.
*  **Potential Data Modification:** While the provided source focuses on information disclosure, the potential to modify the data is inherent in the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Attack Vector:**
*   **Shortcode Parameter Injection:** The vulnerable `id` parameter is accessible through the `wpdevart_booking_calendar` shortcode.
*  **Direct SQL query injection:** It is possible to inject malicious SQL commands by manipulating the id parameter to append SQL queries to the original query

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Contributor Access:** The attacker needs to have at least contributor-level access to the WordPress site. This means they must be able to log in to the WordPress dashboard.
*   **Theme Option Requirement:** The “delete\_prev\_date” theme option must be enabled for the SQL injection vulnerability to be triggered.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is a *time-based blind SQL injection,* meaning attackers may need to employ techniques that infer information based on timing delays, as the results are not directly visible.
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 3.2.19, and is fixed in 3.2.20.
