*   **Potential for Various Attacks:** This could lead to a wide range of malicious actions, including:
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Stealing user session cookies and other sensitive information.
    *   Defacing the website.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Injection:** Attackers leverage the `lunaradio` shortcode by inserting malicious code into its attributes.
