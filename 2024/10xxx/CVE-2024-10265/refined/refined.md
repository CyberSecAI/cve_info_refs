Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10265

**Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Software:** Form Maker by 10Web â€“ Mobile-Friendly Drag & Drop Contact Form Builder plugin for WordPress, versions up to and including 1.15.30

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the improper use of the `add_query_arg` function without proper output escaping within the plugin's code. Specifically, the `wd/includes/notices.php` file generates links using `add_query_arg` to construct URLs for dismissing admin notices. These URLs are then output directly into the HTML, allowing a malicious actor to inject JavaScript code into the query parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Reflected XSS:** The vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the query parameters of URLs. These scripts then get reflected back to the user's browser through the server response.
*   **Inadequate Output Encoding:** The plugin fails to properly encode or sanitize the URL parameters before outputting them into HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Injection:** An attacker can inject any JavaScript code into vulnerable pages.
*   **Session Hijacking:** This malicious code can steal cookies, allowing attackers to impersonate users.
*   **Website Defacement:** Attackers can modify content on the website.
*   **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Attackers can redirect users to phishing or other malicious sites.
*   **Data Theft:** Attackers can steal sensitive information by injecting malicious javascript which sends data to attacker controlled server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Links:** Attackers can craft malicious links with injected JavaScript in the query parameters and trick users into clicking on them (e.g., through phishing emails or other social engineering tactics).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No special privileges:** An attacker does not need any specific user role or permission on the target WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince a user to click on a malicious link.

**Technical Details from the Provided Content:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `wd/includes/notices.php` file.
*   The fix involves using `esc_url` to sanitize the URLs before outputting them to the HTML, specifically for the  `href` attributes in the dismiss links:

    ```php
    // Before:
    echo '<a href="' . $query_str . '" class="dashicons dashicons-dismiss"></a>';
     // After:
    echo '<a href="' . esc_url($query_str) . '" class="dashicons dashicons-dismiss"></a>';
     ```

*   The vulnerable code also appears in the `frontend/views/form_maker.php` file where the `header_image_url` was not being sanitized and was fixed by using `esc_url`.
*   The fix was introduced in version 1.15.31 of the plugin.

**Summary:**

The `Form Maker` plugin contained a reflected XSS vulnerability due to the improper use of `add_query_arg` and lack of output escaping. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into URL parameters, potentially leading to session hijacking, website defacement, data theft and/or redirection to malicious sites. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.15.31 by using `esc_url()` to sanitize the output.
