**Select fields.** Use this option to choose which columns to show on the form. Uncheck the options, which you need to hide on front-end submissions.

**Export to / Show.** These two settings are responsible for showing the rest of the attributes of front-end submissions. You can enable/disable **CSV/XML** export buttons, **Statistics, Views, Conversion Rate** and other additional information.

After configuring all necessary options, press **Insert.** Publish your page with form submissions, and you will be able to view them on front-end.

### Can I let users choose between PayPal or offline payments when submitting the form?

**Premium version** of this handy forms plugin has the features and functions to create PayPal forms. You need to use **Conditional Fields** and **Payment Fields** of the plugin. Here are the necessary steps.

Firstly, add one **Single Choice** field from **Basic Fields** of Form Maker plugin. It should contain the following two options:

* Pay with PayPal
* Pay offline

Afterwards, add two sets of almost identical fields, one of them created with regular form fields, second – with **Payment fields.**

Then you can set conditions from **Form Options > Conditional Fields,** if the user chooses PayPal, payment fields will appear, otherwise, regular fields will.

The user will not be redirected to PayPal if they make their selections using regular form fields.

### How can a migrate Form Maker from one site to another?

If you want to migrate Form Maker database tables from one WordPress site to another, you need to follow the instructions below.

*Please uninstall Form Maker if you have it installed on your second site first, then proceed with these steps:*

**On your first WordPress site:**

1. Go to **PHPMyAdmin** of your site,
2. open your WordPress site database,
3. select **Export** menu item,
4. change the radio button from **Quick** to **Custom,**
5. unselect all tables and select the following 7 tables:

*[wp1\_prefix]\_formmaker*

*[wp1\_prefix]\_formmaker\_blocked*

*[wp1\_prefix]\_formmaker\_query*

*[wp1\_prefix]\_formmaker\_sessions*

*[wp1\_prefix]\_formmaker\_submits*

*[wp1\_prefix]\_formmaker\_themes*

*[wp1\_prefix]\_formmaker\_views*

(where **[wp1\_prefix]** is your WordPress database prefix)

1. scroll all the way down and press the **Go** button. This should export an SQL file containing those 7 tables.

**On your second WordPress site:**

1. Go to your WordPress database,
2. select **Import** menu item,
3. browse for the exported SQL file,
4. scroll all the way down and press **Go** button. This should import Form Maker tables to your WordPress database.

Now you need to change the prefix for those tables to the one that is set for your second WordPress database.

1. Select **[wp1\_prefix]\_formmaker** table from the left pane of PHPMyAdmin of your second WordPress database,
2. select **Operations** menu item from the top menu
3. scroll to **Table Options** box and edit the value of **Rename table to** field with the second WordPress database prefix, so that the table name now looks like this: **[wp2\_prefix]\_formmaker** (where **[wp2\_prefix]** is your second WordPress database prefix)
4. do the same for other 6 tables.
5. go to your second WordPress administration panel and install the Form Maker.

That’s it! Now you should have your forms, submissions, and themes all set up.

### Characters in the submission CSV file do not appear correctly. How can I fix this?

Please note, that this problem is not caused by Form Maker plugin. It is rather a formatting issue in Excel. However, you can prevent it the following way:

* Please open a new Microsoft Excel document first. Then go to **Data** tab from the menu and click on **From Text.**
* Choose the CSV file you need to view. You’ll see a pop-up window with several options, you’ll find the **File Origin** option along with them.
* Please select **Unicode (UTF-8)** for this dropdown and click **Next** if you need to edit other options, or just **Finish** to insert the document.

The special characters in the CSV submissions of your contact forms should appear correctly afterwards.

### I do not receive any submission emails of my forms. How can this be fixed?

This might be a problem related to the hosting configurations of your website. You can check that the following way.

Please install [WP SMTP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smtp/) plugin and go to **Settings > WP SMTP** page. Scroll down to the bottom and send a test mail to your email address.

If the test email will be sent, then the issue is triggered by Form Maker plugin. Please contact [10Web Customer Care at WordPress.org Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/form-maker/). Our developers will have a closer look.

But if the test mail fails, the problem is on the server of your website. Please contact your hosting provider in this case, and ask them to enable mail functions on your site.

### My forms do not submit due to Javascript errors. How can they be eliminated?

This problem could be related to permission settings of Form Maker files on your web server. Please check that the following way.

Connect to your website files via FTP connection and open the following two directories:

*wp-content/uploads/form-maker-frontend/js/*

*wp-content/uploads/form-maker-frontend/css/*

Please make sure all **.css** and **.js** files in these folders have their permissions set to **777.**

If the permissions are correct, please do not hesitate to contact [10Web Customer Care at WordPress.org Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/form-maker/).

### Is it possible to pass parameters from the page URL to form fields?

To fill in values of parameters from a URL into Form Maker fields, it is necessary to implement a custom script. Please navigate to **Form Options > Javascript** page and add the following code inside **before\_load()** function:

```
function getParameterByName(name, url) {
   if (!url) {
      url = window.location.href;
   }
   name = name.replace(/[[]]/g, "$&");
   var regex = new RegExp("[?&]" + name + "(=([^&#]*)|&|#|$)"),
   results = regex.exec(url);
   if (!results) return null;
   if (!results[2]) return '';
   return decodeURIComponent(results[2].replace('/+/g', " "));
}
jQuery("#{{field_id}}").val(getParameterByName("{{param_name}}"));
jQuery("#{{field_id}}").attr("class", "input_active");

```

Where **{{field\_id}}** is the ID of the field you wish to prefill. Also, **{{param\_name}}** is the name of the parameter in the URL.

My partner complained about the huge spam emails received from the contact page. I initially thought of hiring a freelancer to add some kind of human validation for the Contact 7 form. Then I searched the website and found this plugin WP Image CAPTCHA. After I installed and activated it, add those two words per the instruction, and then I got the working contact 7 form with WP Image CAPTCHA. Very easy to add. Thanks a lot!

On their page you will find a option to “Buy Now”, but it does not clearly states that you are SUBSCRIBING for a 6 month billing period. When you ask for a refund: “No refund is provided. There is a 7 day free trial.”. You can be sure that nowhere on the page you can “Free trial” button or option. So I paid for the full function, saw it does not work for me as the added functionality is very small. So now I am stuck with a useless PREMIUN version! |ZERO STARS!!!

### Description

The Form Maker by 10Web – Mobile-Friendly Drag & Drop Contact Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of add\_query\_arg without appropriate escaping on the URL in all versions up to, and including, 1.15.30. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
