Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the "Image Comparison" widget of the Happy Addons for Elementor plugin. Specifically, the `before_label` parameter was not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `before_label` parameter of the Image Comparison widget. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts that are stored in the database and executed when a user visits a page containing the vulnerable widget.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser when they view a page with the compromised widget.
*   **Potential for Malicious Activities:** This can lead to a wide range of malicious activities, including:
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Stealing cookies and session data
    *   Modifying page content
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user
    *   Full compromise of the website

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Widget Parameter Injection:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript into the `before_label` parameter of the "Image Comparison" widget within the WordPress editor.
*   **Stored XSS:** The malicious script is stored in the WordPress database when the page is saved, and executed when a user views the page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with at least Contributor-level access. This means they have the ability to create and edit posts or pages.
*   **Access to Elementor Editor:**  The attacker must be able to access and modify pages with the Elementor editor, specifically using the vulnerable "Image Comparison" widget.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects all versions of the Happy Addons for Elementor plugin up to and including 3.12.5.
*   **Patch:** The vulnerability is patched in version 3.12.6. The patch includes sanitization of the `before_label` and `after_label` parameters by using `esc_html( wp_strip_all_tags( ... ) )` and sanitizing the label text in the javascript.

The provided information goes into more detail than a standard CVE description, including specifics on the vulnerable parameter (`before_label`) and the fix that was implemented in version 3.12.6.
