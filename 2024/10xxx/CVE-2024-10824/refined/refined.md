      "cve": "CVE-2024-10824",
      "is_related": true,
      "summary": "An attacker could gain unauthorized access to secret scanning alert data because the REST API secret scanning endpoint did not properly verify whether the user account has the business owner role. Only organization members can exploit this vulnerability, requiring a personal access token (PAT) with `repo` or `security_events` scopes, limiting exposure to internal actors. Exploitation also required secret scanning to be enabled on user-owned repositories.",
      "root_cause": "Improper access control in the REST API secret scanning endpoint.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient authorization checks",
        "Exposure of sensitive information"
      ],
      "impact": "Unauthorized access to secret scanning alert data.",

        "REST API"

      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be an organization member with a personal access token (PAT) with `repo` or `security_events` scopes. Secret scanning must be enabled on user-owned repositories."
