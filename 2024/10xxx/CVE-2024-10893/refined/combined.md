## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Booking Calendar < 10.6.5 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to https://example.cm/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wpbc-settings
2. Go to "Booking Confirmation" and for "Message title" add `&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(1)&gt;`
3. Save the settings
4. Add a new booking at https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wpbc-new
5. When you click the "Send" button, you will see the XSS
