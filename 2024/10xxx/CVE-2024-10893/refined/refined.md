- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape user-supplied input in its settings, specifically within the "Message title" field of the "Booking Confirmation" settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with administrative privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings. This code will execute when other users, including administrators, view the booking confirmation page. The injected code can be used to perform actions such as: redirect users to malicious sites, steal session cookies or other sensitive information, perform actions on behalf of the user, or deface the website.
- **Attack vectors:**
  1. The attacker needs administrative access to the WordPress site.
  2. The attacker navigates to the plugin's settings page.
  3. The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the "Message title" field in "Booking Confirmation" settings.
  4. The attacker saves the modified settings.
  5. When another user (including admin) creates a new booking and views confirmation, the stored XSS payload executes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges or equivalent capabilities to modify plugin settings.
