Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control within the 'wpr-template' shortcode of the Royal Elementor Addons and Templates plugin. Specifically, there were inadequate restrictions on which posts could be included via this shortcode, leading to unauthorized information disclosure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authorization Bypass:** The plugin failed to properly restrict access to posts based on user roles and post statuses when using the 'wpr-template' shortcode.
- **Information Exposure:** Private and draft posts created using Elementor could be accessed by users who should not have had permission to view them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers with Contributor-level access or higher could extract data from private or draft posts they were not intended to see. This could include sensitive information contained within those posts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by using the 'wpr-template' shortcode with a user-controlled post ID.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated WordPress user with at least Contributor-level access.
- They need to know the ID of the private or draft post they wish to access.
- The attacker needs to be able to use the vulnerable shortcode 'wpr-template'.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was patched in version 1.7.1004 of the plugin. The patch implemented checks to ensure only publicly published posts could be accessed via the shortcode, thus preventing the unauthorized access to private or draft content.
- The patch includes additional checks to prevent access to password-protected posts.
- The vulnerable code was located in `admin/includes/wpr-templates-shortcode.php`.
