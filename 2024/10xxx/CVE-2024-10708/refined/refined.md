- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly validate user input used in a file path.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path Traversal.
- **Impact of exploitation:** High privilege users (e.g., admin) can read arbitrary files on the server.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a crafted request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `sd_viewer` action and a malicious filename parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires a user with high privileges such as an administrator.
