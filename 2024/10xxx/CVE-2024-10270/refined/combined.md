This issue occurs because sensitive runtime values, such as passwords, may be captured during the Keycloak build process and embedded as default values in bytecode, leading to unintended information disclosure.

Indirect usage of environment variables for SPI options and Quarkus properties is also vulnerable due to unconditional expansion by PropertyMapper logic, capturing sensitive data as default values in all Keycloak versions up to 26.0.2. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2322096#c0)  OSIDB Bzimport    2024-10-28 07:40:12 UTC  ``` Sensitive runtime values in Keycloak (up to version 26.0.2) are captured during the build process as default values embedded in bytecode, potentially exposing them during runtime. Affected options include those with the "kc" prefix, SPI runtime options, and Quarkus properties. Environment variables set directly in Keycloak 26 or indirectly in all versions expand unconditionally due to PropertyMapper logic, embedding sensitive data into the bytecode. This unintentional behavior risks sensitive information exposure in production builds.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2322096#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-21 19:23:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Keycloak 24  Via RHSA-2024:10175 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10175](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A10175)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2322096#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-21 19:23:57 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Keycloak 24.0.9  Via RHSA-2024:10176 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10176](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A10176)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2322096#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-21 19:24:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Keycloak 26.0  Via RHSA-2024:10177 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10177](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A10177)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2322096#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-21 19:24:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Keycloak 26.0.6  Via RHSA-2024:10178 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10178](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A10178)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2322096#c6)  Chess Hazlett    2024-11-27 20:41:57 UTC  ``` commit: <https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/pull/35246/files>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2319217#c0)  OSIDB Bzimport    2024-10-16 15:44:58 UTC  ``` Deployments of Keycloak with a reverse proxy not using pass-through termination of TLS, with mTLS enabled, are affected by an issue where an attacker on the local network can authenticate as any user or client that leverages mTLS as the authentication mechanism.  Trusted proxies introduced in Keycloak 26 can mitigate this to some extent by only accepting certificates from proxy headers if the request is coming from the IP address of the proxy. However, this is a very weak form of authentication as IP addresses can in many cases be spoofed.  The attacker would need to have access to the local network, and in addition gain access to the corresponding public certificates, which in many cases is not the hardest thing to do, especially considering that we are assuming an insider, or an attacker that has gained access to the local network.  Additionally, Keycloak can further be configured to not only obtain certificates through HTTP headers, but also to not validate the certificates. If this option is enabled for a deployment the attacker does not have to obtain the actual public certificate, and can simply generate a random one with for example openssl with whatever subject they want.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2319217#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-21 19:23:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Keycloak 24  Via RHSA-2024:10175 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10175](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A10175)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2319217#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-21 19:23:50 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Keycloak 24.0.9  Via RHSA-2024:10176 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10176](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A10176)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2319217#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-21 19:24:37 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Keycloak 26.0  Via RHSA-2024:10177 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10177](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A10177)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2319217#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-21 19:24:48 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat build of Keycloak 26.0.6  Via RHSA-2024:10178 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10178](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A10178)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2319217#c6)  Chess Hazlett    2024-11-27 21:00:09 UTC  ``` commit: <https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/pull/35222/files>   ``` |  |
