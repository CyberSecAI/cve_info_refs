12 November 2024

Overview

Schneider Electric is aware of a vulnerability in its EcoStruxure™ IT Gateway.

The EcoStruxure™ IT Gateway is a component of the EcoStruxure™ IT platform, designed to connect your IT
infrastructure devices to the cloud. It collects data from these devices and securely transmits it to the
EcoStruxure™ IT platform for analysis and management.

Failure to apply the fix provided below may risk unauthorized access to EcoStruxure™ IT Gateway which could
result in control of the Gateway and/or retrieval of sensitive information.

Vulnerability Details

CVE ID: CVE-2024-10575

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 9.8| Critical | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
CVSS v4.0 Base Score 10.0| Critical | CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:L/SA:H

CWE-862: Missing Authorization vulnerability exists that could cause unauthorized access when enabled on
the network and potentially impacting connected devices.

The severity of vulnerabilities was calculated using the CVSS Base metrics for 4.0 (CVSS v4.0). CVSS v3.1
will be still evaluated until the adoption of CVSS v4.0 by the industry. The severity was calculated without
incorporating the Temporal and Environmental metrics. Schneider Electric recommends that customers score
the CVSS Environmental metrics, which are specific to end-user organizations, and consider factors such as
the presence of mitigations in that environment. Environmental metrics may refine the relative severity posed
by the vulnerabilities described in this document within a customer’s environment.

• We encourage customers to enable automatic updates to

receive updates promptly.

• Customers who have enabled automatic updates do not

need to take any further action.

Versions prior to 1.21.0.6 are not impacted by this vulnerability.

Customers should use appropriate methodologies when updating their systems. We strongly recommend the
use of backups and evaluating the impact of the software update in a Test and Development environment or
on an offline infrastructure. Contact Schneider Electric’s Customer Care Center if you need assistance.

If customers choose not to apply the remediation provided above, they should immediately apply the following
mitigations to reduce the risk of exploit:

Customers should protect the Gateway from remote access by controlling access to the software over a
network. The following actions could be taken:

• Placing the Gateway software on protected access-controlled networks only
•
• Removing the Gateway software and installing a clean build of version 1.23.1.10

Implementing a local firewall to deny remote access to the web API.

General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.

•

•

Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from
the business network.
Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control and safety
systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.

• Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the “Program” mode.
• Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for that device.
• Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB drives, etc.

before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.

• Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the intended network to

connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.

•  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that they are not

accessible from the Internet.

•  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).
Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version
available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.

For more information refer to the Schneider Electric Recommended Cybersecurity Best Practices document.
