Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10400

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient escaping of the user-supplied `rating_filter` parameter within the Tutor LMS plugin's SQL queries. Additionally, there is a lack of proper preparation of the SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database.
- While the provided information does not specify other impacts, SQL injection vulnerabilities could potentially lead to data modification or complete compromise of the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
- **Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers.
- The `rating_filter` parameter is the specific entry point for the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable WordPress site.
- No prior authentication or elevated privileges are required.
- The attacker must be able to send requests that include the `rating_filter` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the Tutor LMS plugin up to and including 2.7.6.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.7.7 of the Tutor LMS plugin.
- The provided changelog from the plugin's Trac repository indicates the update was to address "Security vulnerabilities".
- The Wordfence description provides the CVSS score of 7.5, which is considered "High".
- The patch involved changes to the `Utils.php` file, specifically related to how the `rating_having` SQL clause is prepared. It was modified to use `$wpdb->prepare` to prevent SQL Injection. Additionally, a check for the `users_can_register` option has been added in `Instructor.php` in the `register_instructor()` function, preventing registration if the option is not enabled, likely as a secondary security enhancement.
