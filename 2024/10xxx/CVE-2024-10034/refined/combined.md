### Description

The Gallery Blocks with Lightbox. Image Gallery, (HTML5 video , YouTube, Vimeo) Video Gallery and Lightbox for native gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the gallery link text parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.4.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Editor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
