Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user input, specifically the `id` parameter in the `view_service.php` file. The application directly uses this parameter in SQL queries without any prior checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks because it directly uses user-provided input in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Attackers can potentially access and leak sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Data Tampering:** Attackers can modify or delete data present in the database.
- **System Control:** In severe cases, attackers might gain control over the entire system by manipulating SQL queries.
- **Service Disruption:** Attackers can potentially disrupt services by exploiting the vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request that contains a malicious payload within the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker should have knowledge of SQL to craft suitable payloads to exploit the vulnerability.
- **No Authentication Required**: The vulnerability can be exploited without any login or authorization.

**Technical Details:**
- The specific vulnerable file is `/ovas/admin/services/view_service.php`.
- The vulnerable parameter is `id`.
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates the use of a UNION-based SQL injection.
-  The provided payload `?id=-4' union select 1,2,database(),4,5,6,7,8--+` is used to extract the database name.

**Suggested Repair:**
- Use prepared statements and parameter binding to separate SQL code from user input data.
- Implement strict input validation and filtering to ensure user data conforms to the expected format.
- Minimize database user permissions to prevent attackers from performing unauthorized operations.
- Conduct regular code and system security audits to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.
