- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Jetpack plugin versions 13.0 to 14.0 do not properly validate the origin of postMessage events, allowing the origin check to be bypassed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (DOM-XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser when visiting a WordPress.com hosted website. This can lead to account compromise, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker hosts a malicious HTML page which uses `postMessage` to send a crafted message to a vulnerable WordPress.com site in a new window. The vulnerable website interprets this message, leading to JavaScript execution.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to host a malicious HTML page on a server accessible by the victim.
    - The victim needs to visit a vulnerable WordPress.com site.
    - The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
