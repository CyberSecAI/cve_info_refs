- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient user input validation of the 'cat' parameter in the `admin/process_category_add.php` file. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability is present. Specifically, the application directly uses the 'cat' parameter in SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can gain unauthorized database access, sensitive data leakage, data tampering, comprehensive system control, and even service interruption.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `cat` parameter in a POST request to `admin/process_category_add.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability without needing to log in or be authorized. The attacker needs to send a malicious payload through the `cat` parameter.
