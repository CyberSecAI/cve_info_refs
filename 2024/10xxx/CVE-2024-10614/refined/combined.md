### Description

The Customer Reviews for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to a missing capability check on the cancel\_import() function in all versions up to, and including, 5.61.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to cancel and import or check on the status.
