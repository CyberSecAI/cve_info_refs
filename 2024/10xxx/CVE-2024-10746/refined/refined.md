Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10746

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of user-controlled input within the `dom_data.php` file of the Online Shopping Portal 2.0. Specifically, the `$aScripts[$i]` variable, which is directly influenced by the user through the `scripts` parameter, is used to construct a `<script>` tag's `src` attribute without proper encoding or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. User-supplied data is directly embedded into the HTML output without sanitization, allowing the execution of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML code into the vulnerable page. This can lead to:
  - **Data theft:**  Stealing cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
  - **Account hijacking:**  Taking control of a user's session.
  - **Phishing attacks:**  Redirecting users to malicious websites or displaying fake login forms.
  - **Defacement:** Altering the appearance of the page, potentially damaging the credibility of the website.
  - **Malware distribution:** Redirecting to malicious sites that download malware to the user's system

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the URL parameter `scripts` in `dom_data.php`. An attacker crafts a malicious URL, injecting a script payload in that parameter, and then tricks the user into visiting it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to construct a URL with the malicious payload and to trick users into clicking the link.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet is:
```php
echo '<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript" src="../'.$aScripts[$i].'?rand='.rand().'"></script>';
```
- The `$aScripts[$i]` variable, directly influenced by the `scripts` URL parameter, is embedded in the `src` attribute of the `<script>` tag without any sanitization.
- The provided injection payload is:
```
%22%3E%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert('XSS')%3C/script%3E
```
This payload closes the existing `<script>` tag, injects a new `<script>` tag with an `alert('XSS')` and closes it, causing an XSS popup.
- The suggested fix is to use `htmlspecialchars()` to encode special characters before outputting user input:
```php
echo '<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript" src="../' . htmlspecialchars($aScripts[$i], ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8') . '?rand=' . rand() . '"></script>';
```
