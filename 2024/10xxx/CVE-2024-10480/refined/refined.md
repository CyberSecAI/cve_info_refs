- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The 3DPrint Lite plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when updating its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing CSRF checks during settings updates.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can trick a logged-in administrator into unintentionally changing the plugin's settings via a crafted request. This could lead to malicious modifications of the plugin's behavior or the site's appearance. For example, the provided PoC allows changing currency and other pricing related settings.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by tricking a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious HTML page that contains a form submitting the crafted settings update request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to lure a logged-in administrator into visiting a crafted HTML page. The attacker does not need direct access to the admin panel.
