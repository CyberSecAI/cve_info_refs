The TI WooCommerce Wishlist plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'wizard' function in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create new pages, modify plugin settings, and perform limited options updates.
