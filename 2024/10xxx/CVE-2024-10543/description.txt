The Tumult Hype Animations plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the hypeanimations_getcontent function in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.14. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to retrieve animation information.
