### Summary
The provided content details a missing authorization vulnerability in the WP User Manager plugin for WordPress, specifically concerning the addition or removal of custom sidebars managed by the Carbon Fields plugin.

### Root cause of vulnerability
The vulnerability stems from the lack of capability checks in the `add_sidebar` and `remove_sidebar` functions within the `Sidebar_Manager.php` file of the Carbon Fields library integrated into the WP User Manager plugin. This oversight allows any authenticated user, including those with subscriber-level permissions, to execute these functions via AJAX.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- **Missing Authorization:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of authorization checks before executing the `add_sidebar` and `remove_sidebar` functions.
- **Direct Function Access:** The `action_handler` function directly calls the `execute_action` function which executes either `add_sidebar` or `remove_sidebar` based on the provided action parameter.

### Impact of exploitation
- An attacker with minimal user privileges (subscriber level and above) can add or remove custom sidebars. This could lead to:
  - **Website Defacement:** Removing sidebars could impact the layout and functionality of a WordPress site.
  - **Potential Information Disclosure/Modification:** Adding sidebars might be leveraged to inject malicious code or modify site content, depending on the sidebars' configuration.
  - **Denial of Service (Indirect):** By manipulating sidebars, the attacker might render the site difficult to use, indirectly leading to DoS for some users.

### Attack vectors
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploited over the network through AJAX requests.
- **Method:** By sending a crafted AJAX request with the appropriate 'action' parameter ('carbon_fields_add_sidebar' or 'carbon_fields_remove_sidebar') and the sidebar 'name', an authenticated attacker can invoke these functions.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site.
- **Low-Level Privileges:** The vulnerability is exploitable by users with Subscriber level access and above.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress instance.
