The WP User Manager â€“ User Profile Builder & Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'add_sidebar' and 'remove_sidebar' functions in all versions up to, and including, 2.9.11. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to add or remove a Carbon Fields custom sidebar if the Carbon Fields (carbon-fields) plugin is installed.
