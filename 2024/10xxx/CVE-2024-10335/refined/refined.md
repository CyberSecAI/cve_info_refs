Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the `login.php` script. Specifically, the `username` parameter received via POST request is directly incorporated into an SQL query without any form of escaping or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By injecting malicious SQL code into the `username` parameter, an attacker can manipulate the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the login authentication mechanism.
- **Data Breach:** By injecting SQL queries, an attacker could potentially read sensitive data from the database, including user credentials, personal information, or other sensitive details.
- **Data Modification:** An attacker might also modify or delete data from the database.
- **Denial of Service:** In some scenarios, SQL injection can lead to denial of service by overloading the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `login.php` endpoint.
- **`username` Parameter:** The malicious SQL code is injected through the `username` parameter of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `username` parameter in the login page is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to craft HTTP POST requests with the malicious SQL injection payloads.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet is:

```php
$us=$_POST['username'];
$ps=$_POST['password'];
$sql=mysqli_query($con,"SELECT * FROM admin WHERE username='$us' AND password='$ps' AND acstatus='active'");
```

This code directly embeds the user-supplied `$us` variable into the SQL query string, creating an avenue for SQL injection.

The provided SQLmap output confirms the presence of boolean-based blind, error-based, and time-based blind SQL injection vulnerabilities, further validating the severity of this issue.
