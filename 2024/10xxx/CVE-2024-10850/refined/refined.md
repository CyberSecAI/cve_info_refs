Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of user-controlled input when generating URLs, specifically through the use of `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` functions without proper sanitization or escaping in the `Razorpay Payment Button Elementor` plugin for WordPress.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to neutralize input during web page generation, making it susceptible to reflected XSS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into the vulnerable pages.
- If a user is tricked into clicking a malicious link, the injected script will execute in their browser.
- This could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Stealing user session cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user
    - Defacing the website

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
- The attacker then distributes this malicious URL, possibly through phishing emails or by embedding it on another website.
- When a user clicks the link, the malicious script is reflected from the vulnerable page and executed within the user's browser session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any specific privileges on the WordPress site.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking the malicious URL.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability exists in all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.2.5.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.2.6 and later.
- The vulnerable code is located in `rzp-payment-buttons.php` file, specifically in the `get_views()` function.
- The `Wordfence` article provides a good, concise description of the vulnerability and attack vector.
