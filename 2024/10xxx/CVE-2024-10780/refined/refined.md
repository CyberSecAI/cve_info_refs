{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included via the 'narestaurant_elementor_template' shortcode within the Restaurant & Cafe Addon for Elementor plugin.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The plugin does not adequately check user permissions and post statuses before displaying content, allowing unauthorized access to private or draft posts created using Elementor.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with Contributor-level access or higher can extract data from private or draft Elementor posts that they should not have access to, leading to information exposure.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by using the 'narestaurant_elementor_template' shortcode with a user-controlled post ID.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least Contributor-level access to a WordPress site using the vulnerable plugin."
