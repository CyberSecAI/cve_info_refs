Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10247

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a time-based SQL Injection due to insufficient escaping of the user-supplied `orderby` parameter and the lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input, specifically the `orderby` parameter, before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The plugin does not adequately validate or sanitize the `orderby` parameter, allowing malicious SQL code to be introduced.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database by appending malicious SQL queries into the existing queries.
- **Complete Database Takeover:** In severe cases, an attacker could potentially gain full control of the database, potentially modifying or deleting data, adding rogue admin users, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code through the `orderby` parameter in a crafted HTTP request to the WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated as an administrator or higher-level user on the WordPress site.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the WordPress site.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in the `tsvg_get_galleries` function within the `class-tsvg-list.php` file of the plugin.
- The `orderby` parameter is not properly sanitized before being concatenated into the SQL query, allowing for SQL injection.
- The `sanitize_sql_orderby()` function, while present, is not used effectively to prevent the injection.
- The vulnerability is present in versions 2.4.2 and earlier.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Wordfence article provides a CVSS score of 7.2 (High) for the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was publicly published on December 5, 2024.
- The vulnerability was discovered by the researcher `tmrswrr`.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 2.4.3 of the plugin.
