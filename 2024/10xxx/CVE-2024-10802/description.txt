The Hash Elements plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the hash_elements_get_posts_title_by_id() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve draft post titles that should not be accessible to unauthenticated users.
