Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-10696:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation on a user-controlled key within the `show_template` function of the `UltraAddons â€“ Elementor Addons` plugin. This function is associated with the `UA_Template` shortcode. Specifically, the plugin uses the 'id', 'template_id', or 'post_id' attributes of the shortcode to retrieve a post ID. It then fetches the post content based on this ID without sufficient checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The plugin directly uses the provided 'id', 'template_id', or 'post_id' values from the shortcode attributes to fetch content, without verifying if the user has the necessary permissions to view the content of the post. This allows an attacker to bypass access controls.
*   **Missing Authorization Check:** The code checks only the `publish` status of the post before displaying it. It does not verify if the user invoking the shortcode has the right permissions to view draft, private or pending posts, leading to sensitive information exposure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** An authenticated attacker with contributor-level access or higher can use the vulnerable `UA_Template` shortcode to expose the content of draft, private, and pending posts. This could include confidential information, unpublished content, or sensitive data intended only for specific user roles.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Abuse:** An attacker with at least contributor-level access can create a post or page and use the `UA_Template` shortcode (or `UltraAddons_Template` or `ULTRAADDONS_TEMPLATE`) while manipulating the `id`, `template_id`, or `post_id` attributes to reveal the content of other posts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site with at least contributor-level privileges.
*   **Ability to Create Content:** The attacker needs to be able to create or edit posts or pages to insert the malicious shortcode.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.1.8.
*   There's no official patch available at the moment, the recommended mitigations include uninstalling the affected software.
*   The vulnerable code is located in `ultraaddons-elementor-lite/trunk/inc/wp/shortcode.php` file.
*   The code snippet provided from the wordpress.org trac shows the vulnerable logic where the `$post_id` is directly obtained from the shortcode attributes (`$atts['id']`, `$atts['template_id']`, or `$atts['post_id']`) without authorization checks before retrieving the content via `\Elementor\Plugin::instance()->frontend->get_builder_content_for_display($select_post_id)`.
