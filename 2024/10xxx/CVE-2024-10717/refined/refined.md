Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10717

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing capability check in the `deactivate_license` function within the Styler for Ninja Forms plugin. This allows unauthorized access to the function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The `deactivate_license` function lacks proper authorization checks, allowing users with insufficient privileges to access and execute it.
*   **Arbitrary Option Deletion:**  The function can be exploited to delete arbitrary option values in the WordPress database. It can also be used to add arbitrary options with an empty value.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By deleting specific option values, attackers can cause errors on the site, rendering it unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers can modify and delete arbitrary data in the WordPress options table.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Option Addition:** Although the primary impact is deletion, attackers can add arbitrary options with an empty value.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploited through network requests, specifically by sending an AJAX request to the `deactivate_license` action.
*   **Authenticated Users:** Attackers must be authenticated WordPress users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Subscriber Level Access or Higher:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least Subscriber level privileges.
*   **Knowledge of the Target Site:** The attacker needs to know the structure of the WordPress site to target specific options for deletion.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in the `/admin-menu/licenses.php` file of the plugin, specifically the `deactivate_license` function.
*   The AJAX call within the `admin_footer_js` function invokes the `deactivate_license` function via `wp_ajax_deactivate_license`.
*   The function retrieves the `settingKey`, `statusKey`, and `id` from the POST request and uses them to manipulate the `sfnf_licenses` option, with the primary goal of removing the license from the database and deactivating it.
*   The `wp_remote_get` call used in the deactivation process is primarily intended to communicate with a remote licensing server for the actual license deactivation, the response of which is subsequently modified and used to trigger the local manipulation.
*   The actual vulnerability lies in the manipulation of the `sfnf_licenses` option using the data from the AJAX call and updating the options without proper access controls.
*   The vulnerable function does not perform any capability check, thus enabling lower privileged users to perform the described actions.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Wordfence article mentions that this vulnerability can also be used to add arbitrary options with an empty value.
*   The Wordfence article provides a CVSS score of 6.5 (Medium), with the vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N.
