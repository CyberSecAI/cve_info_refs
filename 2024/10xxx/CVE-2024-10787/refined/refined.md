{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The LA-Studio Element Kit for Elementor plugin does not sufficiently restrict which posts can be included via the 'elementor-template' shortcode.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information Exposure due to insufficient access control on the 'elementor-template' shortcode.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Authenticated attackers with Contributor-level access and above can extract data from private and draft posts created by Elementor that they should not have access to.",
  "Attack vectors": "By using the 'elementor-template' shortcode with a user-controlled key, an authenticated attacker can access restricted post data.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be an authenticated user with Contributor-level access or higher."
