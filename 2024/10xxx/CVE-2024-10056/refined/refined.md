Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-10056:

**1. Verification:**
   - The provided content from Wordfence explicitly mentions **CVE-2024-10056** and states the vulnerability as "Contact Form Builder <= 4.10.4 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via livesite-pay Shortcode". This clearly confirms the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping** on user-supplied attributes within the `livesite-pay` shortcode. The plugin fails to properly cleanse user-provided data before rendering it on the page.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored in the database and executed when a user accesses the affected page.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages. When a user (including administrators) accesses an injected page, the malicious script is executed in their browser. This can lead to:
        - **Session Hijacking:** Attacker stealing user's session cookies
        - **Phishing:** Redirecting users to fake login pages
        - **Malware Injection:** Loading malware onto a user's machine
        - **Defacement:** Altering the appearance of the website

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - The attack vector is the `livesite-pay` shortcode of the Contact Form Builder by vcita plugin.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated on the WordPress website.
   - **Privileges:** The attacker requires at least **contributor-level access** or above. This allows them to create or edit posts or pages where the malicious `livesite-pay` shortcode can be injected.
