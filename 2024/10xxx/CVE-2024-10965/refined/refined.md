Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the `/api/v2/schema` endpoint which allows reading arbitrary JSON files on the system by providing a `plugin_name` parameter. This is due to the lack of proper validation on the input, allowing an attacker to specify the path of the json file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Arbitrary JSON File Read:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to read any JSON file on the system by manipulating the `plugin_name` parameter. This is due to the lack of validation/sanitization of the user-provided `plugin_name`.
- **Insecure Input Handling:** The application fails to validate or sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `plugin_name`, allowing path traversal or direct file access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to the leakage of sensitive information stored in JSON files accessible to the system. This may include configuration files, credentials, or other confidential data.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the `/api/v2/schema` endpoint.
- **`plugin_name` parameter:**  The `plugin_name` parameter in the GET request is used to specify the path to the JSON file to be read.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the system hosting the vulnerable application to send the malicious HTTP request.
- **Knowledge of the API Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the `/api/v2/schema` endpoint.
- **Ability to craft HTTP request:** The attacker needs the ability to craft an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint and provide a manipulated  `plugin_name` parameter.

**Additional details:**
- The issue was reported as "Arbitrary JSON File Read #2281".
- The fix involves a check to verify if the plugin schema file exists before attempting to read it. This is done by the addition of a new request type (`NEU_REQ_CHECK_SCHEMA`) to check if a schema exists and a new response type (`NEU_RESP_CHECK_SCHEMA`). The fix is implemented in commit `c9ce397` and merged in pull request #2282.
- The fix prevents the direct use of the plugin name to compose the schema file path.
- Code changes were made in `normal_handle.c`, `normal_handle.h`, `rest.c`, `adapter.c`, `msg_internal.h`, `manager.c`, `plugin_manager.c`, `plugin_manager.h`, `msg.h` and `test_http_api.py`
