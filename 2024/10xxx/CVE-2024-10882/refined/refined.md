### Relevant Content:
The provided content is related to CVE-2024-10882.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the use of `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` without proper escaping of the URL parameters. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts into the page through manipulated URLs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts that would execute in the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or other unauthorized actions on the user's behalf.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through crafted URLs with malicious scripts injected into the query parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not need to be authenticated and needs to trick a user into clicking a malicious link to execute the injected script.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the "Product Delivery Date for WooCommerce - Lite" plugin up to and including version 2.8.0.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 2.8.1, which includes the use of `esc_url()` and `esc_html__()` to properly sanitize and escape the URL parameters.
- The vulnerable code is located in the `get_views()` function within the `class-prdd-lite-view-deliveries-table.php` file, where the plugin generates URLs for filtering deliveries.
- The fix involves using `esc_url()` to sanitize the generated URLs and `esc_html__()` to sanitize strings that are output in the HTML.
