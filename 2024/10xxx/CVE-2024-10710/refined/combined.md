## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# YaDisk Files <= 1.2.5 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Go to `https://example.com/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wp-yadisk-files`
2. Add the payload `"><script>alert(4)</script>` to the "Yadisk Login" field
3. Save and see the XSS

### Affects Plugins
