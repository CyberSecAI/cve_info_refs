The provided content is related to CVE-2024-10752.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `productupdate.php` file of the 'Pet Shop Management System In PHP With Source Code'. The vulnerability exists because the application directly uses the "id" parameter in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The code fails to sanitize user input from the 'id' parameter before using it in SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this SQL injection to gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially leading to sensitive data leakage, data tampering, complete system control, and service interruption.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `productupdate.php` file. An attacker can send malicious SQL code via the "id" parameter, which is used directly in database queries.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `productupdate.php` file with a manipulated `id` parameter. No login or authorization is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
