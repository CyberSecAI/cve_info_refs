- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its Widget settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The lack of sanitization of user input in widget settings allows for injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser when a user views a page where the vulnerable widget is displayed. This could lead to various malicious actions such as session hijacking, stealing cookies, or redirecting users to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the plugin's widget settings, specifically the 'Title' field when adding or editing a 'Booking Calendar' widget via the WordPress admin panel (`/wp-admin/widgets.php`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user, such as an administrator, to add or edit widgets. The vulnerability is exploitable even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed.
