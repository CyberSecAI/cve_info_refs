Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-10851:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Razorpay Payment Button plugin for WordPress using `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` without proper escaping of URL parameters. This allows the injection of arbitrary web scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to reflected XSS due to the lack of sanitization of URL parameters used in generating links within the plugin's admin pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page.
- If a user clicks on a crafted link containing malicious code, the attacker's script will execute in the user's browser.
- This can lead to a range of consequences including session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting the user to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through crafted URLs.
- An attacker needs to create a malicious URL with an injected script.
- The attacker then needs to trick a victim (typically a logged-in administrator) into visiting that URL, usually by social engineering tactics like phishing or by using a website that embeds the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs no authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- They must be able to construct malicious URLs with embedded scripts.
- They must be able to entice a user with administrative privileges to click a malicious link.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the Razorpay Payment Button plugin up to and including 2.4.6.
- The vulnerability is found in the `rzp-payment-buttons.php` and `rzp-subscription-buttons.php` files specifically in the `get_views()` function, where `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` are used to construct the URLs.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.4.7 of the plugin.
