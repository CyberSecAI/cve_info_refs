A flaw was found in pam_access, where certain rules in its configuration file are mistakenly treated as hostnames. This vulnerability allows attackers to trick the system by pretending to be a trusted hostname, gaining unauthorized access. This issue poses a risk for systems that rely on this feature to control who can access certain services or terminals.
