| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2324291#c0)  OSIDB Bzimport    2024-11-07 07:42:58 UTC  ``` A vulnerability in pam_access allows unauthorized users to bypass access restrictions by spoofing hostnames. This occurs because pam_access improperly interprets local access.conf rules to match remote hostnames, compromising configurations intended to restrict local access only. The issue affects all deployments using this configuration method, posing a significant risk to secure environments.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2324291#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-25 15:21:38 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.4 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2024:10232 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10232](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A10232)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2324291#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-25 19:18:47 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2024:10244 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10244](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A10244)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2324291#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-11-26 15:20:02 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2024:10379 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10379](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A10379)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2324291#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-12-03 18:08:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17  Via RHSA-2024:10518 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10518](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A10518)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2324291#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-12-04 04:02:00 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.16  Via RHSA-2024:10528 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:10528](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A10528)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2324291#c11)  Asheth    2024-12-11 10:12:38 UTC  ``` Hello Team,   We can see OpenShift 4.16 and 4.17 listed in the affected components section and a fix has been released for both versions.
