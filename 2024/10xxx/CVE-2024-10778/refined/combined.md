Elementor is easy to work with, yet it does not sacrifice on extensibility and versatility.

We had encountered an issue with the displaying of the bodybuilder elements for our website and after some time waiting support finally got back to us and took a look at it and they had figured out what the issue was and they said that they will resolve the issue in the future and gave us a temporary solution in the meantime, good service very thankful that we actually got help, because so far our experience with plugins and and their support teams hasn’t been very good but this one seems to actually be a good one with good support.

Thank you,

This plugin has not been maintained or upgraded, the docs are no longer valid and support will just string you along. Save your money and look elsewhere. There is much better well developed and well maintained plugins out there that actually work. This plugin is useless and is basically a scam at this point. You have been warned.

### Description

The BuddyPress Builder for Elementor – BuddyBuilder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.4 via the 'elementor-template' shortcode due to insufficient restrictions on which posts can be included. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract data from private or draft posts crated by Elementor that they should not have access to.
