Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-10663:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `goodbye_form_callback()` function of the "Eleblog â€“ Elementor Blog And Magazine Addons" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The `goodbye_form_callback()` function, which processes deactivation feedback, lacks proper capability checks. This allows users with lower-level access (Subscriber+) to submit deactivation reasons, which should typically be restricted to administrators or higher-level users.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Modification:** An attacker with minimal privileges (Subscriber level or higher) can submit arbitrary deactivation reasons and potentially an email address.
*   While the direct impact is limited, an attacker could use this to submit misleading or malicious feedback that could impact the developers and the users of the plugin

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is carried out via HTTP requests, leveraging the plugin's AJAX functionality.
*   **Authentication:** Requires an attacker to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site, with a role of at least Subscriber.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site with a user role of Subscriber or higher.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.
