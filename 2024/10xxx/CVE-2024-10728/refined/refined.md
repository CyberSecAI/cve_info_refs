Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-10728

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* Missing authorization check in the `install_required_plugin_callback` function within the `Importer.php` file of the PostX plugin. Specifically, the function lacked a capability check to ensure only authorized users could install plugins.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Missing Authorization:** The core vulnerability lies in the absence of proper access control. Any authenticated user, including those with minimal 'subscriber' level access, could trigger the plugin installation function due to the lack of capability check.
* **Arbitrary Plugin Installation/Activation:** An attacker could exploit this weakness to install and activate any plugin of their choice.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By installing a vulnerable plugin, attackers could gain the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to a complete compromise of the affected WordPress website.
* **Full Site Takeover:** RCE can facilitate a full site takeover, allowing attackers to modify content, steal data, install malware or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Network:** The vulnerability is reachable over the network.
* **Authentication Required:** Attackers need to be authenticated users on the WordPress site.
* **Specific Function:** The attack vector is through the `install_required_plugin_callback` function via an AJAX request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Authenticated User:**  The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site. Even subscriber-level access is sufficient.
* **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.
* **Knowledge of Plugin Functionality:** The attacker must know or discover the `install_required_plugin_callback` function to leverage the vulnerability
