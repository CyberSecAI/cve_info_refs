  "CVE-2018-0158": {
    "description": "A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) module of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory leak or a reload of an affected device that leads to a denial of service (DoS) condition.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of certain IKEv2 packets.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to a memory leak by the GKM GM Process causing the affected device to continuously consume memory and eventually reload, resulting in a DoS condition.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IKEv2 packets to an affected device to be processed, using IPv4 or IPv6 on UDP ports 500, 848, 4500, or 4848.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.",
     "additional_details": "The IKEv2 protocol is automatically enabled in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software when ISAKMP is enabled.  A device does not need to be configured with any IKEv2-specific features to be vulnerable. A device configured with IKEv1 or IKEv2 is vulnerable because either configuration will process the malformed packet."
