| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 8.6 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.6 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 8.6 |

Last RevisedApril 25, 2018
Alert CodeICSA-18-107-03

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

* **CVSS v3 9.8**
* **ATTENTION**: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit.
* **Vendor**: Rockwell Automation
* **Equipment**: Allen-Bradley Stratix 5900 Services Router
* **Vulnerabilities**: Improper Input Validation, Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, Use of Externally-Controlled Format String.

## 2. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in loss of availability, confidentiality, and/or integrity caused by memory exhaustion, module restart, information corruption, and/or information exposure.

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following versions of Allen-Bradley Stratix Services Router use a vulnerable version of Cisco IOS or IOS XE:

* Allen-Bradley Stratix 5900 Services Router, version 15.6.3M1 and earlier.

### 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

### 3.2.1   [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)

A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) module of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a memory leak or a reload of an affected device that leads to a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of certain IKEv2 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IKEv2 packets to an affected device to be processed. A successful exploit could cause an affected device to continuously consume memory and eventually reload, resulting in a DoS condition.

[CVE-2018-0158](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-0158) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

### 3.2.2   [IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE-119](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)

A vulnerability in the quality of service (QoS) subsystem of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a DoS condition or execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

The vulnerability is due to incorrect bounds checking of certain values in packets that are destined for UDP port 18999 of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious packets to an affected device. When the packets are processed, an exploitable buffer overflow condition may occur. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device with elevated privileges. The attacker could also leverage this vulnerability to cause the device to reload, causing a temporary DoS condition while the device is reloading.

The malicious packets must be destined to and processed by an affected device. Traffic transiting a device will not trigger the vulnerability.

[CVE-2018-0151](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-0151) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

### 3.2.3  [IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE-119](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)

A buffer overflow vulnerability in the LLDP subsystem of Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XE Software, and Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an adjacent, unauthenticated attacker to cause a DoS condition or execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

[CVE-2018-0167](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-0167) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

### 3.2.4   [USE OF EXTERNALLY-CONTROLLED FORMAT STRING CWE-134](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/134.html)

A format string vulnerability in the LLDP subsystem of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an adjacent, unauthenticated attacker to cause a DoS condition or execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

[CVE-2018-0175](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-0175) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Rockwell Automation reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC from the semi-annual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Rockwell Automation has released knowledge base article 1073313 which can be found at the following location:

<https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1073313/> (login required)

Cisco has released Snort Rules 46110 and 46111 to help address CVE-2018-0158 and CVE-2018-0151. See new rules at:

<https://www.cisco.com/web/software/286271056/117258/sf-rules-2018-03-29-new.html>

CVE-2018-0151: Users who do not use the Adaptive QoS for DMVPN feature can deny all traffic destined to UDP port 18999 on an affected device by using a Control Plane Policing (CoPP) policy. If the Adaptive QoS for DMVPN feature is later configured, the device must be upgraded to an unaffected release of Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software and the CoPP policy must be removed.

CVE-2018-0167 and CVE-2018-0175 have no specific mitigations in place. See the following Cisco Vulnerability advisory for more details:

<https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-lldp>

Rockwell Automation also recommends that users implement the following general security guidelines:

* Help minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and confirm that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS-CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the [ICS-CERT website.](/ics/)

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities

The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of certain IKEv2 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IKEv2 packets to an affected device to be processed. A successful exploit could cause an affected device to continuously consume memory and eventually reload, resulting in a DoS condition.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-ike>  This advisory is part of the March 28, 2018, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 20 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 22 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: March 2018 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-66682).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software and have the Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) enabled.  For information about which Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fixed) section of this advisory.  Although only IKEv2 packets can be used to trigger this vulnerability, devices that are running Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software are vulnerable if ISAKMP is enabled. A device does not need to be configured with any IKEv2-specific features to be vulnerable. A device configured with IKEv1 or IKEv2 is vulnerable because either configuration will process the malformed packet.  Many features use IKE, including different types of VPNs such as the following:    + LAN-to-LAN VPN   + Remote-access VPN, excluding SSL VPN   + Dynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN)   + FlexVPN   + Group Encrypted Transport VPN (GET VPN)Determining Whether IKE Is Enabled To determine whether a device is configured for IKE, administrators can use the **show ip sockets** or **show udp** EXEC command in the CLI. If UDP port 500, UDP port 848, UDP port 4500, or UDP port 4848 is open on a device, the device is processing IKE packets.  The following example shows the output of the **show udp** command on a device that is processing IKE packets on UDP port 500 and UDP port 4500, using either IP Version 4 (IPv4) or IP Version 6 (IPv6):  ```   router# show udp      Proto      Remote      Port      Local        Port  In Out  Stat   TTY OutputIF     17       --listen--          192.168.130.21    500   0   0 1001011   0      17(v6)   --listen--          UNKNOWN           500   0   0 1020011   0      17       --listen--          192.168.130.21   4500   0   0 1001011   0      17(v6)   --listen--          UNKNOWN          4500   0   0 1020011   0     .   .   .   router#   ```  Determining the Cisco IOS Software Release To determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the **show version** command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to *Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software* or *Cisco IOS Software*. The banner also displays the installed image name in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.5(2)T1 and has an installed image name of *C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M*:  ```   Router> show version      Cisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)   Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport   Copyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco IOS XR Software or Cisco NX-OS Software.  Details  * The IKEv2 protocol is used in the IPsec protocol suite to negotiate cryptographic attributes that will be used to encrypt or authenticate a communication session. These attributes include the cryptographic algorithm, mode, and shared keys. The result of an IKE negotiation is a shared session secret that will be used to derive cryptographic keys.Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software support IKEv2 for IPv4 and IPv6 communications. IKEv2 communications can use the following UDP ports:    + UDP port 500   + UDP port 848, Group Domain of Interpretation (GDOI)   + UDP port 4500, Network Address Translation Traversal (NAT-T)   + UDP port 4848, GDOI NAT-T Only IKEv2 packets can trigger this vulnerability. IKEv2 is automatically enabled in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software when ISAKMP is enabled.An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using IPv4 or IPv6 on any of the UDP ports in the preceding list.  Indicators of Compromise  * Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a memory leak by the GKM GM Process. The following example provides an indicator of a memory leak, as shown by the fifth column value increasing, which may be caused by this vulnerability:  ```   Router# show processes memory | include GKM GM Process    440   0   13127152        448   13156648         64    48 GKM GM Process     Router# show processes memory | include GKM GM Process    440   0   13130192        448   13159688         64    48 GKM GM Process     Router# show processes memory | include GKM GM Process    440   0   13134192        448   13163688         64    48 GKM GM Process     Router#   ```  If **set memory debug incremental starting-time** is defined and the **show memory debug incremental leaks** command is issued, the resulting output could indicate a memory leak, as shown in the following example:  ```   Router# show memory debug incremental leaks   Adding blocks for GD...   lsmpi_io memory   Address    Size   Alloc_pc  PID  Alloc-Proc       Name   Processor memory   Address          Size     Alloc_pc  PID  Alloc-Proc      Name   7FD007DC81E0      352 55A8A4DED6D0  434  Crypto IKE Disp gkm packet   7FD007DC8340      160 55A8A4DB3E63  440  GKM GM Process  reverse addr   7FD007DC83E0      400 55A8A4DB3968  434  Crypto IKE Disp GKM Rekey / Ack Packet Container   7FD007DC8570      352 55A8A4DED6D0  434  Crypto IKE Disp gkm packet   7FD007DC86D0      144 55A8A4DEDB4E  434  Crypto IKE Disp GKM Queue Data   7FD007DC8760      160 55A8A4DB3E63  440  GKM GM Process  reverse addr   7FD007DC8800      400 55A8A4DB3968  434  Crypto IKE Disp GKM Rekey / Ack Packet Container   7FD007DC8990      352 55A8A4DED6D0  434  Crypto IKE Disp gkm packet   7FD007DC8AF0      144 55A8A4DEDB4E  434  Crypto IKE Disp GKM Queue Data   7FD007DC8B80      160 55A8A4DB3E63  440  GKM GM Process  reverse addr   7FD007DC8C20      400 55A8A4DB3968  434  Crypto IKE Disp GKM Rekey / Ack Packet Container   7FD007DC8DB0      352 55A8A4DED6D0  434  Crypto IKE Disp gkm packet   ```  If the attack is ongoing, the number of entries would continue to increase.

"text": "A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) module of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory leak or a reload of an affected device that leads to a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of certain IKEv2 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IKEv2 packets to an affected device to be processed. A successful exploit could cause an affected device to continuously consume memory and eventually reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-ike [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-ike\"]\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the March 28, 2018, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 20 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 22 vulnerabilities.

"text": "This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software and have the Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) enabled.\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fixed\"] section of this advisory.\r\n\r\nAlthough only IKEv2 packets can be used to trigger this vulnerability, devices that are running Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software are vulnerable if ISAKMP is enabled. A device does not need to be configured with any IKEv2-specific features to be vulnerable. A device configured with IKEv1 or IKEv2 is vulnerable because either configuration will process the malformed packet.\r\n\r\nMany features use IKE, including different types of VPNs such as the following:\r\n\r\nLAN-to-LAN VPN\r\nRemote-access VPN, excluding SSL VPN\r\nDynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN)\r\nFlexVPN\r\nGroup Encrypted Transport VPN (GET VPN)\r\n\r\n Determining Whether IKE Is Enabled\r\nTo determine whether a device is configured for IKE, administrators can use the show ip sockets or show udp EXEC command in the CLI. If UDP port 500, UDP port 848, UDP port 4500, or UDP port 4848 is open on a device, the device is processing IKE packets.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the show udp command on a device that is processing IKE packets on UDP port 500 and UDP port 4500, using either IP Version 4 (IPv4) or IP Version 6 (IPv6):\r\n\r\n\r\nrouter# show udp\r\n Proto Remote Port Local Port In Out Stat TTY OutputIF 17 --listen-- 192.168.130.21 500 0 0 1001011 0 17(v6) --listen-- UNKNOWN 500 0 0 1020011 0 17 --listen-- 192.168.130.21 4500 0 0 1001011 0 17(v6) --listen-- UNKNOWN 4500 0 0 1020011 0 . . . router#\r\n\r\nDetermining the Cisco IOS Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software or Cisco IOS Software. The banner also displays the installed image name in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the show version command or may provide different output.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.5(2)T1 and has an installed image name of C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter> show version\r\n Cisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1) Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport Copyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.

If the device is running Cisco IOS XE Software, the system banner displays Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XE Software, or similar text.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 16.2.1 and has an installed image name of CAT3K\_CAA-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\n\r\nios-xe-device# show version\r\n Cisco IOS Software, Catalyst L3 Switch Software (CAT3K\_CAA-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version Denali 16.2.1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1) Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport Copyright (c) 1986-2016 by Cisco Systems, Inc.

"text": "The IKEv2 protocol is used in the IPsec protocol suite to negotiate cryptographic attributes that will be used to encrypt or authenticate a communication session. These attributes include the cryptographic algorithm, mode, and shared keys. The result of an IKE negotiation is a shared session secret that will be used to derive cryptographic keys.\r\n\r\nCisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software support IKEv2 for IPv4 and IPv6 communications. IKEv2 communications can use the following UDP ports:\r\n\r\nUDP port 500\r\nUDP port 848, Group Domain of Interpretation (GDOI)\r\nUDP port 4500, Network Address Translation Traversal (NAT-T)\r\nUDP port 4848, GDOI NAT-T\r\n\r\nOnly IKEv2 packets can trigger this vulnerability. IKEv2 is automatically enabled in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software when ISAKMP is enabled.\r\n\r\nAn attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using IPv4 or IPv6 on any of the UDP ports in the preceding list."
