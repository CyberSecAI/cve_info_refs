Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the 802.11r Fast Transition feature of Cisco IOS Access Points (APs) software.
*   The root cause is a corruption of certain timer mechanisms which are triggered by specific roaming events. This timer corruption eventually leads to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Timer Mechanism Corruption:** The core weakness is in the way the software handles timers related to the 802.11r fast transition feature, leading to a crash when these timers get corrupted due to specific roaming events.
*   **Lack of Proper Input Validation/Handling:** It appears the software doesn't properly handle malicious reassociation events, resulting in the timer corruption and subsequent crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit causes a denial-of-service condition on the affected Cisco access point. This makes the AP unavailable for network clients.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Adjacent Attacker:** The attacker must be within the wireless range of the targeted access point.
*   **Malicious Reassociation Events:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending crafted or malicious reassociation events multiple times to the same access point in a short period. These events trigger the vulnerability causing a crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within wireless range of the target access point.
*   **Wireless Capabilities:** Ability to send wireless reassociation events, which are part of the 802.11 protocol.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the wireless network.

**Additional Notes:**
*   Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.
*   There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability other than upgrading to a fixed release.
*   The vulnerability is identified as CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption.
*   The vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
*   This is part of a group of advisories released at the same time.
