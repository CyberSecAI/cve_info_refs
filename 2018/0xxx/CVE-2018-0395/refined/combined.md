The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of certain type, length, value (TLV) fields of the LLDP frame header. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted LLDP packet to an interface on the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the switch to reload unexpectedly.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco FXOS or NX-OS Software and LLDP is enabled on an interface. The LLDP protocol is not enabled by default on all FXOS and NX-OS platforms. Administrators are advised to refer to the device’s documentation for more information.  Refer to the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this security advisory for more information about affected releases.    + Firepower 4100 Series Next-Generation Firewall   + Firepower 9300 Security Appliance   + MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches   + Nexus 2000 Series Switches   + Nexus 3000 Series Switches   + Nexus 3500 Platform Switches   + Nexus 5500 Platform Switches   + Nexus 5600 Platform Switches   + Nexus 6000 Platform Switches   + Nexus 7000 Series Switches   + Nexus 7700 Series Switches   + Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode   + Unified Computing System (UCS) 6100 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6300 Series Fabric InterconnectsDetermining Whether LLDP Is Enabled On the Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI mode, the administrator can use the **show lldp interface ethernet** *port/interface*command to determine the LLDP status. In the following example, LLDP is enabled if the transmit (tx) and receive (rx) status is **Y**.  ```   # show lldp interface ethernet port/interface   Interface Information:   Enable (tx/rx/dcbx): Y/Y/N    Port Mac address: 00:fe:c8:09:e2:92   ``` Determining the Cisco FXOS Software Release Administrators can determine the release of Cisco FXOS Software that is running on a device by using the following commands in the device CLI or by navigating to the **Overview** tab in the Admin portal. The following example shows the output of the **show version** CLI command for a device that is running Cisco FXOS Software Release 2.2(2.14), as identified in the **Package-Vers** field of the command output:  ```   QP4120B1 # scope systemQP4120B1 /system # show versionFPRM:Running-Vers: 4.2(2.15)Package-Vers: 2.2(2.14)Activate-Status: Ready   ``` Determining the Cisco NX-OS Software Release Administrators can determine the release of Cisco NX-OS Software running on a device by using the **show version** command in the device CLI. The following example identifies the 11.2(2) release:  ```   nxos-n9k-aci# show versionCisco Nexus Operating System (NX-OS) Softwaresuch license is available at<http://www.opensource.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.php> and <http://www.opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.php>SoftwareBIOS:      version N/Akickstart: version 11.2(2) [build 11.2(1.184)]system:    version 11.2(2) [build 11.2(1.184)]   ``` Determining the Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller Software Release There is a one-to-one mapping between the software for Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI mode. To determine which Cisco APIC release is running on a device, administrators can remove the leftmost *1* from the Cisco NX-OS Software version number. In the previous example, the Cisco APIC Software release is 1.2(2). Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Firepower 2100 Series   + Nexus 1000V Switch for Microsoft Hyper-V   + Nexus 1000V Switch for VMware vSphere   + Nexus 3600 Platform Switches   + Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode   + Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules   + UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects  Indicators of Compromise  * Exploitation of this vulnerability could cause an affected device to reload and generate a core file. Contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to review the core file and determine whether the device has been compromised by exploitation of this vulnerability.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 8.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.8 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 8.8 |
