Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-0894

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `nt!NtQueryVirtualMemory` system call, specifically when invoked with the `MemoryMappedFilenameInformation` (information class 2).
- When querying this information class, the output buffer includes a `UNICODE_STRING` structure followed by the filename string.
- On 64-bit Windows systems, the compiler inserts a 4-byte padding between the `MaximumLength` and `Buffer` fields in the `UNICODE_STRING` structure to ensure 8-byte alignment of the `Buffer` pointer.
- This 4-byte padding is left uninitialized and contains leftover data from the kernel pool, which is then copied to user-mode memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of uninitialized kernel pool memory. This memory can contain sensitive information like kernel addresses, pointers, and other potentially secret data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel ASLR Bypass:** Repeatedly triggering this vulnerability can allow local attackers to leak kernel addresses, which could be used to bypass Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR).
- **Secret Disclosure:** By repeatedly triggering the vulnerability, an attacker might be able to read secrets or other sensitive data stored within the kernel memory, facilitating further exploitation.
- **Denial of Service:** While the provided exploit is categorized as a "dos" (Denial of Service) type, the description and proof-of-concept do not directly cause a denial of service. The "dos" categorization might indicate the potential for repeated memory disclosure to destabilize the system or be a method of triggering the information leak.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the system because it involves a direct call to a system service.
- **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user, as the `NtQueryVirtualMemory` system call requires proper permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to execute code locally on a vulnerable 64-bit Windows system.
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user to call the vulnerable system call.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit targets the `NtQueryVirtualMemory` syscall with the `MemoryMappedFilenameInformation` class.
- The `UNICODE_STRING` structure in 64-bit systems has an uninitialized 4-byte padding between `MaximumLength` and `Buffer` members due to compiler alignment requirements.
-  The code provided shows how the output buffer is used and how it exposes the uninitialized kernel pool memory through this padding.
- The vulnerability is reproducible on Windows 7 to 10 (64-bit) systems, and made more apparent when special pools are enabled on ntoskrnl.exe.

The provided exploit code demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability and leak uninitialized kernel pool memory. It also includes output examples of the leaked data, showing how markers from special pools are exposed.
