Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager Upload Servlet Path Traversal and Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityA vulnerability in the File Upload servlet of Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to upload arbitrary files to any directory of a vulnerable device and then execute those files.      The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of the parameters in the HTTP request and a processing error in the role-based access control (RBAC) of URLs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted Java Server Pages (JSP) file to a specific folder using path traversal techniques and then executing that file remotely. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device with the privileges of the SYSTEM user.      The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score for this vulnerability is: [Base 9.8](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)      The Security Impact Rating (SIR) for this vulnerability is: Critical The Cisco bug ID for this vulnerability is: CSCvf32411 Cisco Prime Infrastructure Upload Servlet Path Traversal and Remote Code Execution VulnerabilityA vulnerability in the File Upload servlet of Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to upload arbitrary files to any directory of a vulnerable device and then execute those files.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 9.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 9.8 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 9.8 |

# [R1] Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager Remote Code Execution

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

While researching [CVE-2017-6640](https://www.tenable.com/plugins/nessus/100993), Tenable discovered an unauthenticated path traversal vulnerability in Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager. The vulnerability is present in the *XmpFileUploadServlet* class in *dcnmweb.war*. As the name suggests, *XmpFileUploadServlet* handles file uploads over HTTP. As such, the path traversal can be used to write a file to any location on the server. An unauthenticated remote attacker can achieve remote code execution by uploading a **war** file that contains a *JSP* webshell.

Proof of concept:

```

curl -k -F 'data=@/tmp/webshell.war' "https://172.26.24.15/Upload?svc=upload&maxFileSize=100000&tacCaseID=../../../../Program%20Files/Cisco%20Systems/dcm/jboss-as-7.2.0.Final/standalone/sandeployments"

```

Cisco reports that this vulnerability also affects Cisco Prime Infrastructure. However, for that case an attacker first needs to be authenticated before they can reach the vulnerability.

### Solution

Cisco has released fixes for both Data Center Network Manager and Prime Infrastructure. Read their advisory for patching information.
