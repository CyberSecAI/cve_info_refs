Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-0258:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper input validation of parameters within HTTP requests made to the File Upload servlet. Additionally, for Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager, there's a processing error in the role-based access control (RBAC) of URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Path traversal: The improper input validation allows an attacker to manipulate file paths, enabling them to write files to arbitrary directories on the server.
- Unrestricted File Upload: The lack of proper validation and access control permits the upload of arbitrary files.
- Remote Code Execution: By uploading malicious files (e.g., JSP files), attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the affected system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can upload and execute arbitrary files on the vulnerable system.
- For Cisco Prime DCNM, an unauthenticated attacker can achieve remote code execution.
- For Cisco Prime Infrastructure, an authenticated, but unprivileged attacker can achieve remote code execution.
- Successful exploitation could grant the attacker SYSTEM-level privileges, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote network attack over HTTP.
- Exploits involve crafting malicious HTTP requests.
- Path traversal techniques are used to specify file upload location.
- Uploading a malicious JSP file is key to gaining code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **For Cisco Prime DCNM**: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable service. No prior authentication is needed.
- **For Cisco Prime Infrastructure**: An attacker needs network access and must have valid, but not necessarily privileged, user credentials.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects both Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) and Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI).
- For DCNM, the vulnerability is present in the XmpFileUploadServlet class in dcnmweb.war, and an unauthenticated attacker can achieve RCE by uploading a war file containing a JSP webshell
- The vulnerability is exploitable by using path traversal techniques during the file upload process.
- There are no workarounds to mitigate the vulnerability.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this issue.
- Tenable discovered this vulnerability while researching another CVE.
- Cisco has assigned bug IDs CSCvf32411 (DCNM) and CSCvf81727 (PI) to this vulnerability.
- CVSS scores are 9.8 for DCNM (unauthenticated) and 8.8 for PI (authenticated)
