The provided content relates to CVE-2018-0594.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue in the DLL search path used by the Skype for Windows application. It is caused by insecurely loading Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) from the same directory where the application resides, a technique referred to as "Application Directory (App Dir) DLL planting".

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure DLL loading: The application loads DLL files from its directory without proper validation or search path restrictions.
- CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: A malicious DLL file placed in the same directory as the vulnerable application can be executed with the privileges of the user running the application.
- Complete compromise of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of the system in the event of malicious DLL execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local: The attacker needs to place the malicious DLL in the same directory as the Skype for Windows application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to write a file in the same directory where the Skype for Windows application resides.
- User interaction is required to execute the application which would load the malicious DLL.
