Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described, which is related to CVE-2018-0934:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `JavascriptArray::BoxStackInstance` function of the Chakra JavaScript engine used in Microsoft Edge. This function is responsible for boxing (copying) stack-allocated JavaScript arrays to the heap. A previous fix (related to issue 1420) introduced a "deepCopy" mechanism that would only deep-copy the array if its "head" pointer was on the stack. However, by allocating the "head" pointer to the heap, this "fix" was bypassed, allowing a shallow copy to be created instead.

The second exploit bypasses the fix in a different way. It exploits the fact that the `JavascriptArray::BoxStackInstance` method caches the copied array. By initially calling the method with `deepCopy` set to `false` (by creating a new Error object which causes the method to be called with `deepCopy=false` for each argument), the next call will return a shallow copied array, regardless of the value of `deepCopy`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Fix:** The initial fix for issue 1420 was not robust enough, and could be circumvented by forcing heap allocation of array metadata.
*   **Shallow Copying:** The vulnerability allows a shallow copy of the array to be created instead of a deep copy when the array head is in the heap (first exploit).
*  **Caching Mechanism Vulnerability**: The second exploit abuses the method's caching mechanism when combined with the fact that `new Error()` calls the method with `deepCopy` set to false.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Type Confusion**: By manipulating the copy process, the attacker can achieve a type confusion vulnerability. This can lead to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided PoCs demonstrate a denial-of-service scenario, resulting from triggering the vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **JavaScript Code:** The vulnerability is triggered through crafted JavaScript code.
*   **Specific Function Calls**: The first exploit requires the array's "head" pointer to be allocated on the heap. The second exploit uses the `new Error()` constructor to force a shallow copy.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Execute JavaScript:** The attacker needs the ability to execute JavaScript code within a vulnerable environment, specifically Microsoft Edge or an environment using the Chakra engine.
*  **Understanding of Chakra's memory management**: The attacker needs to understand how the Chakra engine handles stack to heap copying and how functions like Error objects trigger calls to `JavascriptArray::BoxStackInstance`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content provides more detail than a standard CVE description, including code snippets and PoCs.
*   Both exploits use a similar methodology but achieve the bypass in different ways.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Google Security Research.
*   The provided code can be used as a proof-of-concept to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The first PoC requires a heap allocation for the `stack_arr`'s `head` member by writing to index 20. The second PoC abuses the fact that calling `new Error()` will call the vulnerable function with `deepCopy` set to `false` for every argument in the call stack.
