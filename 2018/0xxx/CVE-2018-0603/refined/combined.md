## Description

Site Reviews is a complete review management solution for your website that is designed to work in a similar way to Amazon, Tripadvisor, and Yelp. The plugin provides blocks, shortcodes, and widgets, along with full documentation.

You can pin your best reviews so that they are always shown first, request review verification, require approval before new reviews are published, require visitors to be logged-in in order to write a review, send a custom notification when reviews are submitted, respond to reviews, and a lot more!

Site Reviews provides more features and options than almost every other free review plugin, and the support provided on the WordPress forum is excellent.

## Installation

#### Minimum Plugin Requirements

* MySQL 5.6 or greater
* PHP 7.4 or greater
* WordPress 6.1 or greater

#### Automatic installation

Automatic installation is the easiest option — WordPress will handle the file transfer, and you won’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Site Reviews, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu, and click “Add New.”

In the search field type “Site Reviews,” then click “Search Plugins.” Once you’ve found it, you can view the plugin details such as the point release, rating, and description. Install it by clicking “Install Now,” and WordPress will take it from there.

#### Manual installation

Manual installation method requires downloading the Site Reviews plugin and uploading it to your web server with a FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation).

#### Updating

Automatic updates should work smoothly, but we still recommend you back up your site.

If you encounter issues with your reviews after an update, go to the Site Reviews Tools page and run the “Migrate Plugin” tool. That should return things to normal.

## FAQ

### How do I use Site Reviews?

The plugin itself seems pretty light on processing needs. Having to adjust shortcodes to differentiate between pages for what reviews go where took some time to troubleshoot. Once I got the plugin set up properly for my pages, it’s worked out well.
One tip: pre-assign the review to the same page it originated from. This would remove guesswork in determining where a new review must be assigned.

### [Advanced product ratings plugin](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/advanced-product-ratings-plugin/)

[stylise](https://profiles.wordpress.org/stylise/ "Posts by stylise")
November 12, 2024

This reviews plugin is extremely robust and allows for a lot of advanced customization that isn’t hidden behind a paywall. You must be technically literate to take full advantage of what it can do, but even the free support offered here is top-tier.
While there’s plenty of documentation, it’s scattered throughout the plugins settings menu. If there’s a standalone and more easily searchable reference, I wasn’t able to find it. This can be a drawback if you intend to implement advanced functionality that can’t be enabled with a setting. Again though, the developers are here and willing to help.
If you’re a novice, I’d recommend purchasing a license. You’ll be in good hands.
