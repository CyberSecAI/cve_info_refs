Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-0214:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient input validation of CLI command user input within Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input to specific CLI commands. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** Certain CLI commands are not properly restricted for the local user, leading to the possibility of privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows an authenticated local attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host operating system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker can execute commands with the privileges of the local user. This implies that the attacker would be able to perform actions that should have been restricted, potentially compromising the system.
*   **Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The CVSS score indicates a medium impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability, implying that the attacker can read sensitive information, modify system data, or cause a disruption of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the vulnerable Cisco ISE device.
*   **CLI Interaction:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by issuing specially crafted CLI commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid user credentials to access the device's CLI.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the device's CLI locally.

**Additional Notes:**

*   There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.

**CVSS Score:**

*   **CVSS v3 Base Score:** 5.3 (Medium)
*   **Vector String:** CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L
