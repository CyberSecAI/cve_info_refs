Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-0204

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from weak login controls in the web portal of the Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning Tool.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insufficient Login Controls:** The web portal lacks adequate protection against repeated failed login attempts, making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
*   **CWE-119** This is a general weakness related to improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer. This seems unlikely to be the direct vulnerability class, as this is a denial of service attack rather than memory corruption. However, it could be a secondary effect related to login attempt processing or logging.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to create a DoS condition for individual users.
*   **Restricted User Access:** Successful exploitation can lead to users being locked out of their accounts, requiring manual administrative intervention to restore access.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** The attacker can be located remotely and does not require any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Brute-Force Attack:** The primary method of exploitation is through a brute-force attack on the login portal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to access the web portal over the network.
*   The attacker doesn't require any special privileges or user interaction.

**Additional Notes:**
*   There are no known workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing by Cisco.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability.
