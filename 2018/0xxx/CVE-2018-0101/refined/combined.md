In addition, it was also found that the original fix was incomplete so new fixed code versions are now available. Please see the [Fixed Software](#fixed) section for more information.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThis vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software that is running on the following Cisco products:   + 3000 Series Industrial Security Appliance (ISA)   + ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances   + ASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls   + ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers   + ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall   + Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv)   + Firepower 2100 Series Security Appliance   + Firepower 4110 Security Appliance   + Firepower 4120 Security Appliance   + Firepower 4140 Security Appliance   + Firepower 4150 Security Appliance   + Firepower 9300 ASA Security Module   + Firepower Threat Defense Software (FTD)   + FTD Virtual (FTDv) **ASA Software** In the following table, the left column lists the vulnerable Cisco ASA features. The right column indicates the vulnerable configuration from the CLI command **show running-config**, if it can be determined.      | **Feature** | **Vulnerable Configuration** |   | --- | --- |   | Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM)1 | http server enable  http |   | AnyConnect IKEv2 Remote Access (with client services) | crypto ikev2 enable  client-services port  webvpn anyconnect enable |   | AnyConnect IKEv2 Remote Access (without client services) | crypto ikev2 enable  webvpn anyconnect enable |   | AnyConnect SSL VPN | webvpn enable |   | Cisco Security Manager2 | http server enable  http |   | Clientless SSL VPN | webvpn enable |   | Cut-Through Proxy (Not vulnerable unless used in conjunction with other vulnerable features on the same port) | aaa authentication listener  port |   | Local Certificate Authority (CA) | crypto ca server no shutdown |   | Mobile Device Manager (MDM) Proxy3 | mdm-proxy enable |   | Mobile User Security (MUS) | webvpn mus password  mus server enable port  mus |   | Proxy Bypass | webvpn  proxy-bypass |   | REST API4 | rest-api image disk0:/ rest-api agent |   | Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) Single Sign-On (SSO)5 | N/A |      1ASDM is vulnerable only from an IP address in the configured **http** command range.   2 Cisco Security Manager is vulnerable only from an IP address in the configured **http** command range.   3The MDM Proxy is first supported as of software release 9.3.1.   4The REST API is first supported as of software release 9.3.2. The REST API is vulnerable only from an IP address in the configured **http** command range.   5SAML SSO is first supported as of software release 9.6.      The customer can also use the **show asp table socket | include SSL|DTLS** command and look for an SSL or a DTLS listen socket on any TCP port. If either socket is present in the output and the ASA device is configured for one or more of the ASA features in the above table, the device is considered vulnerable. The following example shows an ASA device with SSL and DTLS listen sockets: ```   ciscoasa# show asp table socket | include SSL|DTLSSSL       00185038  LISTEN     172.16.0.250:443    0.0.0.0:*SSL       00188638  LISTEN     10.0.0.250:443      0.0.0.0:*DTLS      0018f7a8  LISTEN     10.0.0.250:443      0.0.0.0:*       ``` The customer can also check the **show asp table socket stats protocol ssl** command to list the underlying SSL system statistics. The SSL statistics indicate the number of each type of message received and is further verification that the ASA device is vulnerable. ```   ciscoasa# show asp table socket stats protocol sslNP SSL System Stats:  Handshake Started:          83  Handshake Complete:         60  SSL Open:                    7  SSL Close:                 285  SSL Server:                 84  SSL Server Verify:           0  SSL Client:                  0   ``` **Note:** While certain IKEv2 feature sets do not enable the underlying SSL TCP listening socket, they may still be vulnerable. Customers can use the CLI command **show running-config crypto ikev2** to check if the configuration command **crypto ikev2 enable** is present in the configuration. ```   ciscoasa# show running-config crypto ikev2 | include enablecrypto ikev2 enable Outside   ``` If a command like **crypto ikev2 enable** is present in the running configuration and the command **anyconnect enable** is part of the global **webvpn** configuration, the ASA device is also considered vulnerable.      **Determining the ASA Running Software Release**   To determine whether a vulnerable release of Cisco ASA Software is running on a device, administrators can use the **show version** command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco ASA Software Release **9.2(1)**: ```   ciscoasa# show version | include VersionCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.2(1) Device Manager Version 7.4(1)   ``` Customers who use Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to manage devices can locate the software release in the table that appears in the login window or the upper-left corner of the Cisco ASDM window.      **FTD Software**   This vulnerability applies to all FTD releases before the first fixed software release. The FTD release contains both Firepower and ASA code. Please review the *Firepower Threat Defense Devices* section in the [Cisco Firepower Compatibility Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/compatibility/firepower-compatibility.html#reference_070E1908889545BDB6CC564676202628) for additional information.      In the following table, the left column lists the vulnerable Cisco FTD features. The right column indicates the vulnerable configuration from the CLI command **show running-config**, if it can be determined.      | Feature | Vulnerable Configuration |   | --- | --- |   | HTTP Service enabled1 | http server enable  http |   | AnyConnect IKEv2 Remote Access (with client services)2,3 | crypto ikev2 enable  client-services port   webvpn anyconnect enable |   | AnyConnect IKEv2 Remote Access (without client services)2,3 | crypto ikev2 enable  webvpn anyconnect enable |   | AnyConnect SSL VPN2,3 | webvpn enable |      1 The HTTP feature is enabled via **Firepower Threat Defense Platform Settings > HTTP** on the Firepower Management Console (FMC).   2 Remote Access VPN features are enabled via **Devices > VPN > Remote Access** on the FMC or via **Device > Remote Access VPN** on the Firepower Device Manager (FDM).   3 Remote Access VPN features are first supported as of software release 6.2.2.      The customer can also use the **show asp table socket | include SSL|DTLS** command and look for an SSL or a DTLS listen socket on any TCP port. If either socket is present in the output and the FTD device is configured for one or more of the features listed in the above table, the device is considered vulnerable. The following example shows an FTD device with SSL and DTLS listen sockets: ```   firepower# show asp table socket | include SSL|DTLSSSL       01ffb648  LISTEN     1.1.1.1:443         0.0.0.0:* DTLS      00009438  LISTEN     1.1.1.1:443         0.0.0.0:*   ``` The customer can also check the **show asp table socket stats protocol ssl** command to list the underlying SSL system statistics. The SSL statistics indicate the number of each type of message received and is further verification that the FTD device is vulnerable. ```   firepower# show asp table socket stats protocol sslNP SSL System Stats:  Handshake Started:          44  Handshake Complete:         42  SSL Open:                    2  SSL Close:                  77  SSL Server:                 45  SSL Server Verify:           0  SSL Client:                  0   ``` **Note:** While certain IKEv2 feature sets do not enable the underlying SSL TCP listening socket, they may still be vulnerable. Customers can use the CLI command **show running-config crypto ikev2** to check if the configuration command **crypto ikev2 enable** is present in the configuration. ```   firepower# show running-config crypto ikev2 | include enablecrypto ikev2 enable Outside   ``` If a command like **crypto ikev2 enable** is present in the running configuration and the command **anyconnect enable** is part of the global **webvpn** configuration, the FTD device is also considered vulnerable.      **Determining the Running FTD Software Release**      Administrators can use the **show version** command in the CLI to determine the FTD release. In this example, the device is running software release **6.2.2**:   ```    > show version---------------------[ ftd ]---------------------Model : Cisco ASA5525-X Threat Defense (75) Version 6.2.2 (Build 362)UUID : 2849ba3c-ecb8-11e6-98ca-b9fc2975893cRules update version : 2017-03-15-001-vrtVDB version : 279----------------------------------------------------    ```   Products Confirmed Not VulnerableCisco has confirmed that the AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client is not vulnerable.      No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address all the features that are affected by this vulnerability. The management access to the security appliance can be restricted to known, trusted hosts using the CLI command **http** . Please refer to the *Enable HTTP Service* section in the [Cisco Guide to Harden Cisco ASA Firewall](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/asa-5500-x-series-next-generation-firewalls/200150-Cisco-Guide-to-Harden-Cisco-ASA-Firewall.html#anc15) for further information.

[Omar Santos](https://blogs.cisco.com/author/omarsantos "Posts by Omar Santos")

Cisco is committed to responsible coordinated disclosure about vulnerabilities, and maintains a very open relationship with the security research community. On January 29, 2018, the [Cisco PSIRT](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/security-vulnerability-policy.html) learned about public knowledge of a r[emote code execution and denial of service vulnerability](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180129-asa1) affecting the Cisco ASA and Cisco Next-Generation Firewall platforms. Inline with our [security vulnerability disclosure policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/security-vulnerability-policy.html), we immediately published a [security advisory](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180129-asa1). This vulnerability was originally found by Cedric Halbronn from the NCC Group and Cisco PSIRT has been working with him to assess, fix and disclose this critical security vulnerability.

After broadening the investigation, Cisco engineers found other attack vectors and features that are affected by this vulnerability that were not originally identified by the NCC Group and subsequently updated the [security advisory](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180129-asa1). In addition, it was also found that the original list of fixed releases published in the [security advisory](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180129-asa1) were later found to be vulnerable to additional denial of service conditions. A new comprehensive fix for Cisco ASA platforms is now available.

Cisco puts the security of our customers first. When we have new information about a security vulnerability in our products, we strive to provide up-to-date information and updates to make sure our customers know what it is and how to address it.

The [security advisory](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180129-asa1) has been updated with information about the newly identified affected features and updated software fixes.

While Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any malicious use of this vulnerability, Cisco highly recommends all customers upgrade to a fixed software version. This proactive patching is especially important for those customers whose devices and configurations include potential exposure through the expanded attack surface.

## Affected Device Identification

The [security advisory](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180129-asa1) lists details about the affected features and affected software versions. However, I would like to highlight one of the best methods that can be used to identify an affected device.

First, in order for an attacker to successfully exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must send a crafted XML message to an interface that is configured with one of the features described in the [security advisory](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180129-asa1).

[![](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images-new/ciscoblogs/1/5a75d55850ffb.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images-new/ciscoblogs/1/5a75d55850ffb.png)

To be vulnerable the affected device must have Secure Socket Layer (SSL) services or IKEv2 Remote Access VPN services enabled on an interface.

Regardless of the features, you can use the **show asp table socket** command and look for an SSL or a DTLS listen socket on any TCP port, as shown below:

[![](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images-new/ciscoblogs/1/5a726ed84eec1.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images-new/ciscoblogs/1/5a726ed84eec1.png)

If a socket exists, you are vulnerable. You can also use the **show asp table socket stats** command to list the underlying SSL system statistics, as demonstrated below:

[![](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images-new/ciscoblogs/1/5a726ed5f3bba.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images-new/ciscoblogs/1/5a726ed5f3bba.png)

The NP SSL statistics indicate the number of each type of message received. Most indicate the start and completion of new SSL connections to either the SSL server or SSL client. This vulnerability only affects traffic destined to the affected device, not transient traffic. If your device terminates SSL connections, your device is vulnerable.

IKEv2 configurations are also affected. You can use the **show run crypto ikev2 | grep enable** command to assess if IKEv2 is enabled in your device, as shown below.

[![](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images-new/ciscoblogs/1/5a727a2ff0777.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images-new/ciscoblogs/1/5a727a2ff0777.png)

If a command like **crypto ikev2 enable**is present in the running configuration and the command **anyconnect enable** is part of the global **webvpn**configuration, the ASA device is also considered vulnerable.

[![](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images-new/ciscoblogs/1/5a75d7ada4e7d.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images-new/ciscoblogs/1/5a75d7ada4e7d.png)

In order for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability the offending packets must be received on an interface that has IKEv2 or any of the affected features described in the [security advisory](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180129-asa1). Please refer to the security advisory for a complete list of affected features and configurations. These are only quick ways to accelerate the assessment.

If affected, Cisco strongly recommends that you update your device with fixed software.

## Obtaining Fixes

Cisco PSIRT investigates and discloses vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of *First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the Last Day of Support* to all customers and the public at the same time simultaneously. Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the [Cisco Support website.](https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html) Cisco recommends contacting the TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

In order to improve the overall security of the Internet, in the event of high-severity security vulnerabilities, Cisco also offers customers free software updates who purchased directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract, as well as those who purchased through third-party vendors but cannot obtain fixed software through their point of sale . This is one example of a critical security vulnerability where access to fixed software is being extended.  Non-contract customers  who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the [Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html). To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the TAC should provide the URL of the [security advisory.](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180129-asa1)

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license. Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

This is also documented in our [public security vulnerability policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/security-vulnerability-policy.html#ssu).

The security community is always willing to help and Cisco PSIRT is aware of individuals posting Cisco ASA software at their own websites for other people to download. In order to ensure that you are downloading and installing genuine Cisco software, we highly recommend that you only obtain Cisco software from [Cisco’s website](https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html?mdfid=279513386&i=rm) or from the [Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) via any of the methods listed in the following link:

<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>

We always recommend that you verify the SHA512 checksum for all Cisco software. You can obtain more information on how to perform SHA checksum verification at a blog post I previously posted in the following link:

<https://blogs.cisco.com/security/sha512-checksums-for-all-cisco-software>

## A Graphical View of the Affected Versions and First Fixed Information

The [security advisory](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180129-asa1) lists the details about all affected software versions and the first fixed releases. The following is a high-level graphical summary of the migration path for the Cisco ASA:

[![](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images-new/ciscoblogs/1/5a75da0c6a3c5.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images-new/ciscoblogs/1/5a75da0c6a3c5.png)

Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software is also affected by this vulnerability. A hotfix for Cisco FTD Software version 6.2.2 is now available. Please refer to the [security advisory](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180129-asa1) to obtain additional details.

Cisco recognizes the technology vendor’s role in protecting customers, and we won’t shy away from our responsibility to constantly be transparent with up-to-date information.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Thoughts on the handling CVE-2018-0101 / Cisco Bug CSCvg35618

[January 30, 2018February 5, 2018](https://icanthackit.wordpress.com/2018/01/30/thoughts-on-the-handling-cve-2018-0101-cisco-bug-cscvg35618/) [colin](https://icanthackit.wordpress.com/author/colinpedwards/)

Update: 02/05/2018 – Cisco’s advisory and fixed software versions have changed.  For current info, refer to <https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180129-asa1>.  The tables and fixed releases listed below are stale.  All currently recommended ASA Software versions to fix CVE-2018-0101 were published on Feb 3. If you patched before that, you need to patch again.

Original Post:

I want to rant for a few moments.  It was never my intention to use this blog as an outlet for ranting, but I don’t seem to find the time to publish much content, and I needed a place to let this out.  Maybe this doesn’t even qualify as a rant.  Either way, let’s get to it.

I want to talk about Cisco Bug ID CSCvg35618, CVE-2018-0101, which received a CVSS 3.0 score of 10.  This is the highest (most critical) rating that a vulnerability can receive.  Cisco published an advisory for this bug [here](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180129-asa1) on January 29, 2018 at 17:00 GMT.

The table below is pulled directly from that advisory.  It lists Cisco ASA major software versions that are affected in the column on the left, and the ASA Interim Software Version that the vulnerability was fixed in on the right.

| **Cisco ASA Major Release** | **First Fixed Release** |
| --- | --- |
| 8.x1 | Affected; migrate to 9.1.7.20 or later |
| 9.0 | Affected; migrate to 9.1.7.20 or later |
| 9.1 | 9.1.7.20 |
| 9.2 | 9.2.4.25 |
| 9.3 | Affected; migrate to 9.4.4.14 or later |
| 9.4 | 9.4.4.14 |
| 9.5 | Affected; migrate to 9.6.3.20 or later |
| 9.6 | 9.6.3.20 |
| 9.7 | 9.7.1.16 |
| 9.8 | 9.8.2.14 |
| 9.9 | 9.9.1.2 |

The next table is something that I just put together.  It has all of the First Fixed Releases from the table above on the left, and the date that they were made available for download from Cisco’s support website on the right.

| **First Fixed Release** | Release Date |
| --- | --- |
| 9.1.7.20 | November 15, 2017 |
| 9.2.4.25 | January 8, 2018 |
| 9.4.4.14 | December 8, 2017 |
| 9.6.3.20 | November 28, 2017 |
| 9.7.1.16 | November 10, 2017 |
| 9.8.2.14 | November 10, 2017 |
| 9.9.1.2 | Unavailable? |

Eighty days.  Eighty days is the amount of time that passed between the earliest software version that fixed the vulnerability being released, and the advisory being published.  Eighty Days!

Other Major Release versions had interim versions released more recently, but for some versions, it was eighty days.

To reiterate – this is a critical vulnerability, with a CVSS Score of 10.  The vulnerability can result in Remote Code Execution and Denial of Service when it’s exploited.

If I were to draw a network diagram for *most* organizations that own Cisco ASAs, where do you think those devices are placed on that diagram?  That’s right – most of the time an ASA is at the edge of the network and accessible from the Internet.  In fact, if you have an account for Shodan (<https://www.shodan.io/>), go ahead and run a query “Set-Cookie: webvpn”, and you can find over 160,000 devices connected to the internet that certainly look like ASAs, and they might be running vulnerable versions of the webvpn / AnyConnect services.

I can understand some of the challenges that Cisco and their peers are up against.  But even with that, I’m not sure that customers should be willing to accept that an advisory like this can be withheld for eighty days after some fixes are already available.  Eighty days is a long time, and it’s a particularly long time for a vulnerability with a CVSS Score of 10 that affects devices that are usually directly connected to the internet.

I know what at least one person reading this is going to think – “But… the updates were available already, so you should have patched your systems in a timely manner regardless of an advisory like this being published.”  Yes, customers need to take responsibility for installing patches in a timely manner.  However, customers also need to have access to adequate information so that they can appropriately prioritize among myriad workloads.  The advisory that Cisco published on January 29, 2018 contains the information that is so critical for customers to have at their disposal.

Beyond the need for customers to have access to critical information, there is another problem that Cisco could help to resolve.  There are many customers and engineers at VARs that only install Cisco “Suggested” releases that receive a “gold star” icon to attest to their quality, stability, longevity, and adoption rate.  None of the interim releases that fix CVE-2018-0101 are “suggested” “gold star” releases.  That needs to change.  Cisco needs to do more to encourage customers and VARs to install software versions that include security fixes.

By the inherent nature of interim releases that contain critical security fixes, those releases are never going to have a “gold star” – they have not been available long enough for Cisco to attest to their quality, stability, longevity, and adoption rate.  The criteria for a release receiving the “gold star” icon needs to change, or there needs to be another icon next to the release that indicates a severity level.  With a fix for a critical vulnerability included in a release, all of the interim releases listed above would be identified as Critical releases if there were somewhere that Cisco shared that type of rating.

Transparency is important.  Share critical security information as soon as possible.  Help us protect our systems.  Strive to be a better technology partner.

   […] La bonne nouvelle, c’est que Cisco avait publié des patchs correctifs visant à empêcher l’exploitation de cette faille. Ceux-ci avaient d’ailleurs été publiés à l’avance, corrigeant la faille de sécurité sans que Cisco n’attire spécifiquement l’attention sur cet aspect du patch. Cisco a choisi d’attendre avant de prévenir ses clients de l’importance de ce patch. La mauvaise nouvelle, c’est que Cisco a pris son temps. Un peu trop longtemps au goût d’un administrateur système nommé Colin Edwards qui est revenu sur son blog sur les délais entre les premiers patchs et l’avertissement de Cisco.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 10.0 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 10.0 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 10.0 |

"text": "Update from February 5, 2018: After further investigation, Cisco has identified additional attack vectors and features that are affected by this vulnerability. In addition, it was also found that the original fix was incomplete so new fixed code versions are now available. Please see the Fixed Software [\"#fixed\"] section for more information.\r\n\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the XML parser of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system or to remotely execute code. It was also possible that the ASA could stop processing incoming Virtual Private Network (VPN) authentication requests due to a low memory condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to an issue with allocating and freeing memory when processing a malicious XML payload. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted XML packet to a vulnerable interface on an affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the system, cause a reload of the affected device or stop processing of incoming VPN authentication requests.\r\n\r\nTo be vulnerable the ASA must have Secure Socket Layer (SSL) services or IKEv2 Remote Access VPN services enabled on an interface. The risk of the vulnerability being exploited also depends on the accessibility of the interface to the attacker. For a comprehensive list of vulnerable ASA features please refer to the table in the Vulnerable Products [\"#vulnerable\"] section.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address all the features that are affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n"

The FTD release contains both Firepower and ASA code. Please review the Firepower Threat Defense Devices section in the Cisco Firepower Compatibility Guide [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/compatibility/firepower-compatibility.html#reference\_070E1908889545BDB6CC564676202628\"] for additional information.\r\n\r\nIn the following table, the left column lists the vulnerable Cisco FTD features. The right column indicates the vulnerable configuration from the CLI command show running-config, if it can be determined.\r\n\r\n Feature Vulnerable Configuration\r\n HTTP Service enabled1\r\n http server enable \r\nhttp   \r\n AnyConnect IKEv2 Remote Access (with client services)2,3\r\n crypto ikev2 enable  client-services port \r\nwebvpn\r\n anyconnect enable AnyConnect IKEv2 Remote Access (without client services)2,3 crypto ikev2 enable \r\nwebvpn\r\n anyconnect enable AnyConnect SSL VPN2,3 webvpn\r\n enable  1 The HTTP feature is enabled via Firepower Threat Defense Platform Settings > HTTP on the Firepower Management Console (FMC).\r\n2 Remote Access VPN features are enabled via Devices > VPN > Remote Access on the FMC or via Device > Remote Access VPN on the Firepower Device Manager (FDM).\r\n3 Remote Access VPN features are first supported as of software release 6.2.2.\r\n\r\nThe customer can also use the show asp table socket | include SSL|DTLS command and look for an SSL or a DTLS listen socket on any TCP port. If either socket is present in the output and the FTD device is configured for one or more of the features listed in the above table, the device is considered vulnerable. The following example shows an FTD device with SSL and DTLS listen sockets:\r\n\r\nfirepower# show asp table socket | include SSL|DTLS\r\nSSL 01ffb648 LISTEN 1.1.1.1:443 0.0.0.0:\*\r\nDTLS 00009438 LISTEN 1.1.1.1:443 0.0.0.0:\*\r\nThe customer can also check the show asp table socket stats protocol ssl command to list the underlying SSL system statistics. The SSL statistics indicate the number of each type of message received and is further verification that the FTD device is vulnerable.\r\nfirepower# show asp table socket stats protocol ssl\r\nNP SSL System Stats:\r\nHandshake Started: 44\r\nHandshake Complete: 42\r\nSSL Open: 2\r\nSSL Close: 77\r\nSSL Server: 45\r\nSSL Server Verify: 0\r\nSSL Client: 0\r\nNote: While certain IKEv2 feature sets do not enable the underlying SSL TCP listening socket, they may still be vulnerable. Customers can use the CLI command show running-config crypto ikev2 to check if the configuration command crypto ikev2 enable is present in the configuration.\r\nfirepower# show running-config crypto ikev2 | include enable\r\ncrypto ikev2 enable Outside\r\nIf a command like crypto ikev2 enable is present in the running configuration and the command anyconnect enable is part of the global webvpn configuration, the FTD device is also considered vulnerable.\r\n\r\nDetermining the Running FTD Software Release\r\n\r\nAdministrators can use the show version command in the CLI to determine the FTD release. In this example, the device is running software release 6.2.2:\r\n> show version\r\n---------------------[ ftd ]---------------------\r\nModel : Cisco ASA5525-X Threat Defense (75) Version 6.2.2 (Build 362)\r\nUUID : 2849ba3c-ecb8-11e6-98ca-b9fc2975893c\r\nRules update version : 2017-03-15-001-vrt\r\nVDB version : 279\r\n----------------------------------------------------"

# About

I am Colin Edwards.  I’m mostly a Systems/Network Admin, but I have a huge interest in Information Security and the majority of my daily work revolves around security in some way.  I have several InfoSec certifications (CISSP, GMOB, GCIH, GCWN, GSEC), and I am always excited for an opportunity to learn, research, and share.

Contact me on Keybase – <https://keybase.io/edwardscp>

Ultimately, one of my goals for this page is for it to be a source of encouragement for people interested in a career in Info Sec or even IT in general.  As years have gone by, and I’ve continued to learn more, I have found that this often quoted saying holds true: “The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don’t know” (usually attributed to Einstein, but I don’t have proof that it came from him, and I hate spreading misinformation).  This has occasionally led me to feelings of “Poser Syndrome” or “Imposture Syndrome”, and I’ve heard those same feelings echoed by other folks that work in the Information Security space.  In reality, even the most talented and brilliant minds in Info Sec are still learning new things every single day, and no one should ever feel discouraged by the feeling that they have a lot more to learn before they would consider themselves an “expert” of some kind.

Opinions expressed are my own and do not express the views or opinions of my employer.

# AES encrypted credentials for Powershell scripts (and a bit about DPAPI)

[July 28, 2018July 28, 2018](https://icanthackit.wordpress.com/2018/07/28/aes-encrypted-credentials-for-powershell-scripts-and-a-bit-about-dpapi/) [colin](https://icanthackit.wordpress.com/author/colinpedwards/)[AES](https://icanthackit.wordpress.com/tag/aes/), [Credentials](https://icanthackit.wordpress.com/tag/credentials/), [DPAPI](https://icanthackit.wordpress.com/tag/dpapi/), [Encryption](https://icanthackit.wordpress.com/tag/encryption/), [Powershell](https://icanthackit.wordpress.com/tag/powershell/), [PSCredential](https://icanthackit.wordpress.com/tag/pscredential/), [RNGCryptoServiceProvider](https://icanthackit.wordpress.com/tag/rngcryptoserviceprovider/), [SecureString](https://icanthackit.wordpress.com/tag/securestring/)

I recently went through the process of learning about how you could encrypt and store passwords for user accounts in a way that they can be easily used in a Powershell script.  While researching how to do this, I found a lot of information on how to encrypt the password using Microsoft’s Data Protection Application Programming Interface (DPAPI) encryption.  However, I didn’t find very many write-ups on how to do the same thing using AES encryption.  So I’m going to share what I found and how it can be implemented.

### AES? DPAPI? Why might I choose one over the other?

Before getting to the details for implementation, I want to mention some reasons why you may (or may not) want to use AES instead of DPAPI.  Both DPAPI and AES have native support in Powershell, so they can both be used relatively easily.

Data that is encrypted using DPAPI can only be decrypted on the same Host that encrypted the data (and it might even need to be the same user profile…I read a couple of things that mentioned that, but haven’t dug deeper to find out if that’s accurate or tested it).  That means that the data that’s encrypted using DPAPI isn’t portable – it can’t be decrypted on other computers (excluding potential attacks against the encryption).  Some people might find DPAPI to be appealing because its lack of portability keeps the data more secure from a Confidentiality perspective.

Data that is encrypted using AES, on the other hand, can be decrypted by any computer that has the AES key that was used to encrypt the data.  That means that the data that’s encrypted using AES is portable.  If the data needs to be migrated to another host for any reason (normal systems migrations, disaster recovery, etc), it will continue to be accessible as long as you have access to the AES key that was used.  Some people might find the portability of AES to be appealing because it keeps the encrypted data more secure from an Availability perspective.

Ultimately, whether you choose to use DPAPI or AES is a decision that each person or organization needs to make, and you need to weigh the pros and cons of each option.  In either case, if any variety of encryption is implemented without an appropriate amount of consideration, it can result in bad situations like an inability to access data that you need (effectively, a self inflicted Denial of Service attack) or the data not being as confidential as you thought because of poor access controls on the keys.

Now that we’ve covered that part, let’s move on to how you can use Powershell to (1) generate and store a 256-bit AES key, (2) encrypt the password for a User Account using that AES key, and (3) use that AES encrypted password in a script (to authenticate with a mail server, in this case).

### Preparing your environment to use AES encrypted passwords

Use the Powershell below to get your environment prepared.  Before executing these steps, you will need to have: (1) a secure location to store your key, (2) a secure location to store your encrypted password, (3) the password for the User account that you need to use in your script.

```
#Prep Step 1 - Use Powershell to Generate a 256-Bit Key and store it in a given path
#            - For this step, you need to identify a secure location to store your Key.  It is critical that you limit access to this location using ACLs.
$KeyStoragePath = "c:\YourKeyStorage   OR   \\FileServer01\KeyStorageShare"
$KeyFileName = "Username@YourDomainDotCom.AES.Key"
$CreateKey = New-Object Byte[] 32
[Security.Cryptography.RNGCryptoServiceProvider]::Create().GetBytes($CreateKey)
$CreateKey | out-file "$KeyStoragePath\$KeyFileName"

#Prep Step 2 - Capture the password for your User Account as a Secure String, AES Encrypt it using the Key generated in Step 1, and save it to a file.
#            - For this step, you need to identify a secure location to store your encrypted Password.  Although this password is encrypted, you should still limit access to this location using ACLs.
#            - Complete this step immediately after Prep Step 1.  It relies on variables that were defined in Prep Step 1.
#            - After the 4th line below is executed, you will need to type the password for your user account (Username@YourDomainDotCom) at Powershell's Read-Host prompt.
$GetKey = Get-Content "$KeyStoragePath\$KeyFileName"
$CredentialsStoragePath = "C:\YourEncryptedCredentialsStorage   OR   \\FileServer02\CredentialsStorageShare"
$CredentialsFileName = "Username@YourDomainDotCom.securestring"
$PasswordSecureString = Read-Host -AsSecureString
$PasswordSecureString | ConvertFrom-SecureString -key $GetKey | Out-File -FilePath "$CredentialsStoragePath\$CredentialsFileName"

```

The screenshot below shows Prep Step 1.  A 256-Bit (32-Byte) key is generated using a .NET Random Number Generator.  For demonstration purposes, the contents of the key file is displayed.

![Prep Step 1](https://icanthackit.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/prep-step-1.png?w=660)

The screenshot below shows Prep Step 2.  The password for “Username@YourDomainDotCom” is typed into the Powershell “Read-Host -AsSecureString” prompt, and then the password is encrypted and saved to a file.  For demonstration purposes, the content of the encrypted password file is displayed.

![Prep Step 2](https://icanthackit.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/prep-step-2.png?w=660)

After you complete those two Prep Steps, you will have your Key and Encrypted Password saved to files, and you will be able to use them when you execute other Powershell scripts in the future.

### Using your AES Encrypted password in a script

The script below demonstrates how you can use your AES Encrypted password in a script.  In this example, the password is being used to authenticate with a Mail Server.

```
#Use your AES Encrypted password file to authenticate with a Mail Server. Define mail server and user, decrypt the encrypted Credentials file, using the Key File, and load it into PSCredential so it can be passed to Send-MailMessage, compose email, and send.
#Define Mail Server Details
$PSEmailServer = "Mail.YourDomainDotCom"
$SMTPPort = 587
$SMTPUsername = "Username"
#Define Key File Details
$KeyStoragePath = "c:\YourKeyStorage\"
$KeyFileName = "Username@YourDomainDotCom.AES.Key"
$GetKey = Get-Content "$KeyStoragePath\$KeyFileName"
#Define Encrypted Password File Detaisl
$CredentialsStoragePath = "C:\YourEncryptedCredentialsStorage"
$CredentialsFileName = "Username@YourDomainDotCom.securestring"
$EncryptedPasswordFile = "$CredentialsStoragePath\$CredentialsFileName"
#Use the Key to decrypt the password and load it into memory as a SecureString
$SecureStringPassword = Get-Content -Path $EncryptedPasswordFile | ConvertTo-SecureString -Key $GetKey
$EmailCredential = New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList $SMTPUsername,$SecureStringPassword
#Define Email Message Options
$MailTo = "RecipientAddress@DomainDotCom"
$MailFrom = "Username@YourDomainDotCom"
$MailSubject = "Hello world"
$MailBody = "Here's the a test email that was sent using Powershell Send-MailMessage to send an email.  The Powershell Script authenticated with the sending mail server using credentials that were stored in an encrypted file and decrypted on the fly during script execution to be passed as a System.Management.Automation.PSCredential."
#Send Email
Send-MailMessage -From $MailFrom -To $MailTo -Subject $MailSubject -Body $MailBody -Port $SMTPPort -Credential $EmailCredential -UseSsl
```

The screenshot below shows the demonstration script excluding the “Define Email Message Options” and “Send Email” portions at the end of the script.  For demonstration purposes, it also shows what the content of the $EmailCredentials variable, a PSCredential object, looks like.  Because the password was loaded as a SecureString, the Password is displayed as “System.Security.SecureString” instead of the actual password being displayed.

![Prep Step 3](https://icanthackit.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/prep-step-3.png?w=660)

I don’t show the email portion in the demonstration screenshots because I’m not using a real Mail Server and User Account for this.  But it all works as long as all of the options that you define for the Send-MailMessage command are valid for the Mail Server that you use.

### Decrypting a password file to reveal the plaintext password

As a final note on this post – I mentioned earlier that controlling access to your Key is critical, because anyone that has access to the key can decrypt the data that was secured with it.  In the situation that I’m demonstrating, since the key is being used to encrypt the password for an account, if an attacker can get their hands on the Key and the encrypted password file, then they may be able to use the User Account for accessing other services on the network (in addition to authenticating with the Mail Server, as the scripts demonstrate).

So, you got your hands on the key and password file, and you want to decrypt it to recover the plaintext password?  This will do it (re-using some variables that were used in previous scripts above)

```
$SMTPUsername = "Username"
$KeyStoragePath = "c:\YourKeyStorage\"
$KeyFileName = "Username@YourDomainDotCom.AES.Key"
$GetKey = Get-Content "$KeyStoragePath\$KeyFileName"
$CredentialsStoragePath = "C:\YourEncryptedCredentialsStorage"
$CredentialsFileName = "Username@YourDomainDotCom.securestring"
$EncryptedPasswordFile = "$CredentialsStoragePath\$CredentialsFileName"
$SecureStringPassword = Get-Content -Path $EncryptedPasswordFile | ConvertTo-SecureString -Key $GetKey
$EmailCredential = New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList $SMTPUsername,$SecureStringPassword
$EmailCredential.GetNetworkCredential().Password
```

The screenshot below shows that Powershell code being used to expose the plaintext password we encrypted earlier.  The password is “ThisIsMyP@ssw0rdfjaldskf;jNENROIEFDnlndlfw392fdkjslfjo3fdkNLFDSNFKJLSo32eo9#(\*$)#$#(\*%&NFJEI#fdklew”

Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThis vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software that is running on the following Cisco products:   + 3000 Series Industrial Security Appliance (ISA)   + ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances   + ASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls   + ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers   + ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall   + Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv)   + Firepower 2100 Series Security Appliance   + Firepower 4110 Security Appliance   + Firepower 4120 Security Appliance   + Firepower 4140 Security Appliance   + Firepower 4150 Security Appliance   + Firepower 9300 ASA Security Module   + Firepower Threat Defense Software (FTD)   + FTD Virtual (FTDv) **ASA Software** In the following table, the left column lists the vulnerable Cisco ASA features. The right column indicates the vulnerable configuration from the CLI command **show running-config**, if it can be determined.      | **Feature** | **Vulnerable Configuration** |   | --- | --- |   | Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM)1 | http server enable  http |   | AnyConnect IKEv2 Remote Access (with client services) | crypto ikev2 enable  client-services port  webvpn anyconnect enable |   | AnyConnect IKEv2 Remote Access (without client services) | crypto ikev2 enable  webvpn anyconnect enable |   | AnyConnect SSL VPN | webvpn enable |   | Cisco Security Manager2 | http server enable  http |   | Clientless SSL VPN | webvpn enable |   | Cut-Through Proxy (Not vulnerable unless used in conjunction with other vulnerable features on the same port) | aaa authentication listener  port |   | Local Certificate Authority (CA) | crypto ca server no shutdown |   | Mobile Device Manager (MDM) Proxy3 | mdm-proxy enable |   | Mobile User Security (MUS) | webvpn mus password  mus server enable port  mus |   | Proxy Bypass | webvpn  proxy-bypass |   | REST API4 | rest-api image disk0:/ rest-api agent |   | Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) Single Sign-On (SSO)5 | N/A |      1ASDM is vulnerable only from an IP address in the configured **http** command range.   2 Cisco Security Manager is vulnerable only from an IP address in the configured **http** command range.   3The MDM Proxy is first supported as of software release 9.3.1.   4The REST API is first supported as of software release 9.3.2. The REST API is vulnerable only from an IP address in the configured **http** command range.   5SAML SSO is first supported as of software release 9.6.      The customer can also use the **show asp table socket | include SSL|DTLS** command and look for an SSL or a DTLS listen socket on any TCP port. If either socket is present in the output and the ASA device is configured for one or more of the ASA features in the above table, the device is considered vulnerable. The following example shows an ASA device with SSL and DTLS listen sockets: ```   ciscoasa# show asp table socket | include SSL|DTLSSSL       00185038  LISTEN     172.16.0.250:443    0.0.0.0:*SSL       00188638  LISTEN     10.0.0.250:443      0.0.0.0:*DTLS      0018f7a8  LISTEN     10.0.0.250:443      0.0.0.0:*       ``` The customer can also check the **show asp table socket stats protocol ssl** command to list the underlying SSL system statistics. The SSL statistics indicate the number of each type of message received and is further verification that the ASA device is vulnerable. ```   ciscoasa# show asp table socket stats protocol sslNP SSL System Stats:  Handshake Started:          83  Handshake Complete:         60  SSL Open:                    7  SSL Close:                 285  SSL Server:                 84  SSL Server Verify:           0  SSL Client:                  0   ``` **Note:** While certain IKEv2 feature sets do not enable the underlying SSL TCP listening socket, they may still be vulnerable. Customers can use the CLI command **show running-config crypto ikev2** to check if the configuration command **crypto ikev2 enable** is present in the configuration. ```   ciscoasa# show running-config crypto ikev2 | include enablecrypto ikev2 enable Outside   ``` If a command like **crypto ikev2 enable** is present in the running configuration and the command **anyconnect enable** is part of the global **webvpn** configuration, the ASA device is also considered vulnerable.      **Determining the ASA Running Software Release**   To determine whether a vulnerable release of Cisco ASA Software is running on a device, administrators can use the **show version** command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco ASA Software Release **9.2(1)**: ```   ciscoasa# show version | include VersionCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.2(1) Device Manager Version 7.4(1)   ``` Customers who use Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to manage devices can locate the software release in the table that appears in the login window or the upper-left corner of the Cisco ASDM window.      **FTD Software**   This vulnerability applies to all FTD releases before the first fixed software release. The FTD release contains both Firepower and ASA code. Please review the *Firepower Threat Defense Devices* section in the [Cisco Firepower Compatibility Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/compatibility/firepower-compatibility.html#reference_070E1908889545BDB6CC564676202628) for additional information.      In the following table, the left column lists the vulnerable Cisco FTD features. The right column indicates the vulnerable configuration from the CLI command **show running-config**, if it can be determined.      | Feature | Vulnerable Configuration |   | --- | --- |   | HTTP Service enabled1 | http server enable  http |   | AnyConnect IKEv2 Remote Access (with client services)2,3 | crypto ikev2 enable  client-services port   webvpn anyconnect enable |   | AnyConnect IKEv2 Remote Access (without client services)2,3 | crypto ikev2 enable  webvpn anyconnect enable |   | AnyConnect SSL VPN2,3 | webvpn enable |      1 The HTTP feature is enabled via **Firepower Threat Defense Platform Settings > HTTP** on the Firepower Management Console (FMC).   2 Remote Access VPN features are enabled via **Devices > VPN > Remote Access** on the FMC or via **Device > Remote Access VPN** on the Firepower Device Manager (FDM).   3 Remote Access VPN features are first supported as of software release 6.2.2.      The customer can also use the **show asp table socket | include SSL|DTLS** command and look for an SSL or a DTLS listen socket on any TCP port. If either socket is present in the output and the FTD device is configured for one or more of the features listed in the above table, the device is considered vulnerable. The following example shows an FTD device with SSL and DTLS listen sockets: ```   firepower# show asp table socket | include SSL|DTLSSSL       01ffb648  LISTEN     1.1.1.1:443         0.0.0.0:* DTLS      00009438  LISTEN     1.1.1.1:443         0.0.0.0:*   ``` The customer can also check the **show asp table socket stats protocol ssl** command to list the underlying SSL system statistics. The SSL statistics indicate the number of each type of message received and is further verification that the FTD device is vulnerable. ```   firepower# show asp table socket stats protocol sslNP SSL System Stats:  Handshake Started:          44  Handshake Complete:         42  SSL Open:                    2  SSL Close:                  77  SSL Server:                 45  SSL Server Verify:           0  SSL Client:                  0   ``` **Note:** While certain IKEv2 feature sets do not enable the underlying SSL TCP listening socket, they may still be vulnerable. Customers can use the CLI command **show running-config crypto ikev2** to check if the configuration command **crypto ikev2 enable** is present in the configuration. ```   firepower# show running-config crypto ikev2 | include enablecrypto ikev2 enable Outside   ``` If a command like **crypto ikev2 enable** is present in the running configuration and the command **anyconnect enable** is part of the global **webvpn** configuration, the FTD device is also considered vulnerable.      **Determining the Running FTD Software Release**      Administrators can use the **show version** command in the CLI to determine the FTD release. In this example, the device is running software release **6.2.2**:   ```    > show version---------------------[ ftd ]---------------------Model : Cisco ASA5525-X Threat Defense (75) Version 6.2.2 (Build 362)UUID : 2849ba3c-ecb8-11e6-98ca-b9fc2975893cRules update version : 2017-03-15-001-vrtVDB version : 279----------------------------------------------------    ```   Products Confirmed Not VulnerableCisco has confirmed that the AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client is not vulnerable.      No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address all the features that are affected by this vulnerability. The management access to the security appliance can be restricted to known, trusted hosts using the CLI command **http** . Please refer to the *Enable HTTP Service* section in the [Cisco Guide to Harden Cisco ASA Firewall](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/asa-5500-x-series-next-generation-firewalls/200150-Cisco-Guide-to-Harden-Cisco-ASA-Firewall.html#anc15) for further information.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:   [http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN\_.html](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html)  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.  **Customers Without Service Contracts**  Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.  **Fixed Releases**   In the following tables, the left column lists major releases of Cisco ASA Software. The right column indicates whether a major release is affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for this vulnerability.
