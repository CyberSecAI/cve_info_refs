Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-0101:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an issue in the XML parser of Cisco ASA Software, specifically related to how it allocates and frees memory when processing a malicious XML payload. This improper memory management can lead to a double-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Double-Free Vulnerability (CWE-415):** The core issue is a double-free, which occurs when the same memory location is freed multiple times, leading to memory corruption.
- **Improper Input Validation**: The vulnerability is triggered by a specifically crafted XML message, implying the lack of proper input validation on the incoming XML data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code and gain full control of the affected system by sending a malicious XML packet.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can cause the device to reload or stop processing VPN authentication requests due to a low memory condition.
- **Memory Corruption:** The double-free vulnerability leads to memory corruption, which is the underlying cause of the RCE and DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attacker sends a crafted XML packet to a vulnerable interface of the ASA device.
- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Specific Features:** Vulnerable features include ASDM, AnyConnect IKEv2 and SSL VPN, Cisco Security Manager, Clientless SSL VPN, Cut-Through Proxy, Local Certificate Authority, Mobile Device Manager, Mobile User Security, Proxy Bypass, REST API, SAML SSO. The presence of an SSL or DTLS listen socket indicates potential vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have network access to a vulnerable interface on the ASA device.
- The attacker needs the ability to send a crafted XML message with specific headers to the target device on ports used for the vulnerable features.
- No prior authentication is needed.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the vulnerable device.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the device is configured for features like AnyConnect (IKEv2 or SSL), ASDM, or other features that expose an SSL/TLS socket.
- The vulnerability affects both Cisco ASA Software and Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) software.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
- There are no workarounds that mitigate all affected features, but access can be limited to trusted hosts via the http command.
- Exploitation attempts have been observed in the wild.

The provided Exploit-DB content includes a proof-of-concept Python script that demonstrates how to send the crafted XML to trigger the vulnerability, causing a device crash. This shows that the vulnerability is easily exploitable.
