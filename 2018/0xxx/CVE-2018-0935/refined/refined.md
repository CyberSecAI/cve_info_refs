Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from multiple use-after-free issues within the JScript engine's array methods. Specifically, when an array method (like `join`, `reverse`, `sort`, etc.) is called on an object that is not an array, JScript attempts to retrieve and convert the object's `length` property to a scalar value.
*   During this conversion, the `length` property is not tracked by the garbage collector. The conversion process triggers `toString()` or `valueOf()` callbacks, and within these callbacks, the `length` property can be freed.
*   Subsequently, if the code inside `toString()`/`valueOf()` tries to access `this`, it is accessing the memory which has already been freed resulting in Use-After-Free.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free (UAF):** The core vulnerability is a use-after-free condition. Memory allocated for the object's `length` property is freed while the code is still holding a pointer to it, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates that triggering this vulnerability leads to a crash of the JScript engine due to an access violation (reading freed memory). The crash would cause the application using the JScript engine (like Internet Explorer) to terminate, thus denying service.
*   **Potential for arbitrary code execution (not directly demonstrated in PoC):** While the provided PoC only demonstrates a crash, UAF vulnerabilities can, under certain circumstances, be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution. By carefully controlling the memory layout and freed objects, an attacker might be able to overwrite memory with malicious content and gain control of the program execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **JavaScript execution in Internet Explorer:** The vulnerability can be triggered by loading a malicious HTML page containing JavaScript that exploits the vulnerable JScript array methods. The provided PoC uses an HTML file that can be loaded in IE.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to serve malicious web content:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver HTML pages containing the exploit JavaScript code to the victim's browser (Internet Explorer). This could be achieved through a malicious website, a compromised website, or via a phishing email containing a malicious link.
*   **User interaction:** The user must visit the malicious page with a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer for the attack to succeed.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit-db entry also specifies the following details:
    *   The PoC was tested on Windows 7 64-bit in IE 11.0.50 with a 64-bit tab process and with Page Heap enabled.
    *   The issue is present in multiple array methods including: `join`, `reverse`, `sort`, `pop`, `push`, `shift`, `unshift`, `slice`, and `splice`.
    *   The vulnerability is triggered only when the entire memory block containing `this` variable gets freed. The PoC creates an object with a large number of elements to trigger this case.
    *   The suggested fix is to always put the `this` VAR on the garbage collector root list before any function gets called.
