**Vulnerable App:**

```
Windows Defender inspects a variety of different archive formats, among others RAR.

Inspection of mpengine.dll revealed that the code responsible for processing RAR archives appears to be a forked and modified version of the original unrar code; given that it still processes the VMSF_UPCASE filter (which was removed in unrar 5.0), it seems that the code is derived from a version of unrar older or equal than 4.2.4.

Interestingly, the issue discovered in CVE-2012-6706 (Sophos VMSF_DELTA, and in 2017 unrar) and other signedness issues in the RarVM::ExecuteStandardFilter function were fixed long ago (apparently without a report to upstream, most likely by simply turning the relevant variables from "signed" to "unsigned").

It appears that this blanket conversion from signed to unsigned ended up introducing a new vulnerability, though:

From unrar 4.2.4 rarvm.cpp:

    case VMSF_RGB:
      {
        int DataSize=R[4],Width=R[0]-3,PosR=R[1];
        byte *SrcData=Mem,*DestData=SrcData+DataSize;
        const int Channels=3;
        SET_VALUE(false,&Mem[VM_GLOBALMEMADDR+0x20],DataSize);
        if ((uint)DataSize>=VM_GLOBALMEMADDR/2 || PosR<0)
          break;
        for (int CurChannel=0;CurChannel<Channels;CurChannel++)

The code clearly ensures that PosR is positive from here on.

This check is no longer present in the binary version of the same code in mpengine, most likely since most signed comparisons in this function have been turned unsigned.

This causes a vulnerability later in the same function (RarVM::ExecuteStandardFilter)

Decompile of the mpengine code snippet:

if ( PosR + 2 < DataSize ) {
  v50 = (_BYTE *)(v39 + PosR);
  do {
    v51 = v50[1];
    *v50 += v51;
    v50 += 3;
    *(v50 - 1) += v51;
  } while ( (unsigned int)&v50[2 - v39] < DataSize );

Original unrar code:
  for (int I=PosR,Border=DataSize-2;I<Border;I+=3)
  {
    byte G=DestData[I+1];
    DestData[I]+=G;
    DestData[I+2]+=G;
  }

An attacker that can set PosR to be -2, and DataSize to 1, will bypass the (PosR + 2 < DataSize) check. v50 above will then point to one byte *before* the allocated buffer (v50 respective DestData points into a buffer at index DataSize -- so adding -2 to index 1 will index to -1. The byte from the start of this array will be added into the byte preceding the array.

A minimal sample RAR file that exhibits these traits & causes mpengine to corrupt memory and crash is attached.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
