| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 7.7 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 7.7 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 7.7 |

The vulnerability is due to the incorrect implementation of the CLI command, resulting in a failure to free all allocated memory upon completion. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the affected device and repeatedly issuing a specific CLI command or sending a specific SNMP poll request for a specific Object Identifier (OID). A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the IP routing process to restart or to cause a device reset, resulting in a DoS condition.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:  This advisory is part of the June 2018 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Collection, which includes 24 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 24 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: June 2018 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Collection](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-67770).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco NX-OS Software.  For information about which Cisco NX-OS Software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.  **Checking the Status of SNMP**  Administrators can check whether SNMP is running on a device by using the **show running-config snmp** command on the device CLI. If the command returns output, SNMP is configured.  ```   nxos-switch# show running-config snmp   !Command: show running-config snmp   .   .   .   snmp-server user admin network-admin auth md5 ***** priv ***** localizedkey   snmp-server community  group network-admin   ``` Determining the Cisco NX-OS Software Release Administrators can check the release of Cisco NX-OS Software that is running on a device by using the **show version** command in the device CLI. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco NX-OS Software Release 7.0(3)I5(1):  ```   nxos-switch# show version   Cisco Nexus Operating System (NX-OS) Software   TAC support: http://www.cisco.com/tac   Copyright (C) 2002-2016, Cisco and/or its affiliates.

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Firepower 2100 Series   + Firepower 4100 Series Next-Generation Firewall   + Firepower 9300 Security Appliance   + MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches   + Nexus 1000V Series Switches   + Nexus 1100 Series Cloud Services Platforms   + Nexus 2000 Series Switches   + Nexus 3500 Platform Switches   + Nexus 3600 Platform Switches   + Nexus 5500 Platform Switches   + Nexus 5600 Platform Switches   + Nexus 6000 Series Switches   + Nexus 7000 Series Switches   + Nexus 7700 Series Switches   + Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode   + Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules   + UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects Cisco has not investigated whether this vulnerability affects Cisco Nexus 4000 Series Switches, Cisco Nexus 5010 Switches, or Cisco Nexus 5020 Switches because those products have reached end-of-life status. For more information, refer to the [End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement for the Cisco Nexus 4000 Series Switch Modules for IBM BladeCenter](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/nexus-4000-series-switches/eos-eol-notice-c51-733205.html) and the [End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement for the Cisco Nexus 5010 and Nexus 5020 Switches](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/nexus-5000-series-switches/eol_c51-709037.html).  Details  * The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an application-layer protocol that provides a standardized framework and a common language for monitoring and managing devices in a network. It defines a message format for communication between SNMP managers and agents.  An SNMP agent gathers data from the SNMP MIB, which is the repository of information about device parameters and network data. It also responds to requests from an SNMP manager to get or set data. An SNMP agent contains MIB variables for which values can be requested or changed by an SNMP manager by using **get** or **set** operations.  This vulnerability affects all versions of SNMP supported on the device-Versions 1, 2c, and 3. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific SNMP packet to an affected device via IPv4 or IPv6. Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability.  To exploit this vulnerability via SNMP Version 2c or earlier, the attacker must know the SNMP read-only community string for the affected system. A community string is a password that is applied to a device to restrict both read-only and *read-write* access to the SNMP data on the device. These community strings, as with all passwords, should be chosen carefully to ensure that they are not trivial. They should also be changed at regular intervals and in accordance with network security policies. For example, the strings should be changed when a network administrator changes roles or leaves the organization.  To exploit this vulnerability via SNMP Version 3, the attacker must have user credentials for the affected system.  To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must take time to repeatedly send a specific CLI command or send a specific SNMP poll request for a specific OID to the affected device. Therefore, the attacker cannot immediately exhaust system memory; instead, system resources would be consumed over time.  Indicators of Compromise  * Exploitation of this vulnerability could exhaust system memory. The administrator can monitor the IPFIB process memory usage using the **show process memory | include ipfib | PID** command. If an ongoing increase is observed in the total amount of memory allocated to the IPFIB process, contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to help determine if a proactive reboot of the device is needed: ```   # show process memory | include ipfib | PID   PID    MemAlloc  MemLimit    MemUsed     StackBase/Ptr      Process   25179  71282688  1181531648  487817216   ffaf2ca0/ffaf1d9c  ipfib   26561  352071680 0           905453568   ff9a87a0/ff9a78a0  ipfib      # show processes memory | include ipfib | PID   PID    MemAlloc  MemLimit    MemUsed     StackBase/Ptr      Process   25179  71282688  1181531648  487817216   ffaf2ca0/ffaf1d9c  ipfib   26561  358326272 0           911708160   ff9a87a0/ff9a78a0  ipf   ``` In addition, exploitation of this vulnerability could cause an affected device to reload and generate an IPFIB core file. To view the IPFIB core file, administrators can use the **show core** command in the NX-OS CLI. Contact the Cisco TAC to review the core file and determine whether the device has been compromised by exploitation of this vulnerability.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  As a mitigation for the vulnerability that is described in this advisory, administrators can configure an access control list (ACL) on an SNMP community to filter incoming SNMP requests to ensure that SNMP polling is performed only by trusted SNMP clients. In the following example, the device will accept incoming SNMP requests only from a single trusted host, 192.168.1.2:  ```   switch# show access-list acl_for_snmp   IPV4 ACL acl_for_snmp     10 permit udp 192.168.1.2/32 192.168.1.3/32 eq snmp    ```  To implement the preceding ACL, administrators can add it to the **snmp-server community** configuration command:  ```   switch# show running-config snmp   !Command: show running-config snmp   snmp-server community mycompany    use-acl acl_for_snmp   ```  For additional information about configuring ACLs to filter incoming SNMP requests, see [Filtering SNMP Requests](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus5000/sw/system_management/b_Cisco_Nexus_5000_Series_NX-OS_System_Management_Configuration_Guide/Cisco_Nexus_5000_Series_NX-OS_System_Management_Configuration_Guide_chapter9.html#task_D3862190751F4B1A9F5353B015A888A7) in the *NX-OS Configuration Guide*.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

"title": "Details",
"text": "The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an application-layer protocol that provides a standardized framework and a common language for monitoring and managing devices in a network. It defines a message format for communication between SNMP managers and agents.\r\n\r\nAn SNMP agent gathers data from the SNMP MIB, which is the repository of information about device parameters and network data. It also responds to requests from an SNMP manager to get or set data. An SNMP agent contains MIB variables for which values can be requested or changed by an SNMP manager by using get or set operations.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability affects all versions of SNMP supported on the device���Versions 1, 2c, and 3. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific SNMP packet to an affected device via IPv4 or IPv6. Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability via SNMP Version 2c or earlier, the attacker must know the SNMP read-only community string for the affected system. A community string is a password that is applied to a device to restrict both read-only and read-write access to the SNMP data on the device. These community strings, as with all passwords, should be chosen carefully to ensure that they are not trivial. They should also be changed at regular intervals and in accordance with network security policies. For example, the strings should be changed when a network administrator changes roles or leaves the organization.\r\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability via SNMP Version 3, the attacker must have user credentials for the affected system.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must take time to repeatedly send a specific CLI command or send a specific SNMP poll request for a specific OID to the affected device. Therefore, the attacker cannot immediately exhaust system memory; instead, system resources would be consumed over time."

"title": "Workarounds",
"text": "There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a mitigation for the vulnerability that is described in this advisory, administrators can configure an access control list (ACL) on an SNMP community to filter incoming SNMP requests to ensure that SNMP polling is performed only by trusted SNMP clients. In the following example, the device will accept incoming SNMP requests only from a single trusted host, 192.168.1.2:\r\n\r\n\r\nswitch# show access-list acl\_for\_snmp\r\nIPV4 ACL acl\_for\_snmp 10 permit udp 192.168.1.2/32 192.168.1.3/32 eq snmp\r\n\r\nTo implement the preceding ACL, administrators can add it to the snmp-server community configuration command:\r\n\r\n\r\nswitch# show running-config snmp\r\n!Command: show running-config snmp snmp-server community mycompany use-acl acl\_for\_snmp\r\n\r\nFor additional information about configuring ACLs to filter incoming SNMP requests, see Filtering SNMP Requests [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus5000/sw/system\_management/b\_Cisco\_Nexus\_5000\_Series\_NX-OS\_System\_Management\_Configuration\_Guide/Cisco\_Nexus\_5000\_Series\_NX-OS\_System\_Management\_Configuration\_Guide\_chapter9.html#task\_D3862190751F4B1A9F5353B015A888A7\"] in the NX-OS Configuration Guide."
