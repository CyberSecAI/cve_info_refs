Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-0309:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect implementation of a specific CLI command within Cisco Nexus 3000 and 9000 Series Switches. This leads to a failure to free all allocated memory upon command completion. The same vulnerability exists with the associated Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) MIB.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper memory management in the handling of a specific CLI command.
- Failure to release allocated memory, leading to memory exhaustion.
- The same improper memory management also affects the device's SNMP implementation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeated exploitation leads to system memory exhaustion, potentially causing:
    - The IP routing process to restart.
    - A device reset (reboot).
    - Device reload and generation of an IPFIB core file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- **CLI:** By repeatedly issuing a specific vulnerable CLI command.
- **SNMP:** By sending specific SNMP poll requests for a specific Object Identifier (OID).
  - SNMP versions 1, 2c, and 3 are all affected.
  - Exploitation via SNMP v2c or earlier requires knowing the read-only community string.
  - Exploitation via SNMPv3 requires valid user credentials.
- Exploitation can be carried out using either IPv4 or IPv6.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the device. This can be via:
    - CLI access with valid credentials.
    - SNMP access with either a valid community string (SNMP v1 or v2c) or valid user credentials (SNMP v3).
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send traffic to the vulnerable device.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is not immediately exploitable. Memory exhaustion occurs over time with repeated exploitation.
- The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
- No workarounds are available, but mitigations are possible by configuring access control lists (ACLs) on SNMP communities to filter incoming SNMP requests and restrict them to trusted SNMP clients.
- Software updates have been released by Cisco to address this vulnerability.
