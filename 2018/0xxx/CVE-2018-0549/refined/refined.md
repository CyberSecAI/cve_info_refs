**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject and store malicious scripts within the "Rich text" of the "Message" application.

    - Access sensitive information visible to the user

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- The attacker needs to inject the malicious script via the "Rich text" field in the "Message" application.
- The injected script is then triggered when another user views that message.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with the ability to create or modify messages and use the "Rich text" functionality in the "Message" application.
- The attacker needs to entice a different, logged-in user to view the crafted message.

**Additional details:**
- This is a stored XSS vulnerability, meaning the malicious script is stored on the server.
- The vulnerability is specific to the "Rich text" functionality within the "Message" application of Cybozu Garoon.
