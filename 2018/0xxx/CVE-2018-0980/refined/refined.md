{
  "CVE-2018-0980": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability is due to a bug in the Chakra JIT compiler's bound check elimination process. The InvariantBlockBackwardIterator class incorrectly traverses the control flow graph, leading to incorrect information about hoisted bound checks, ultimately causing the removal of necessary bound checks.",
    "root_cause": "Incorrect traversal of the control flow graph by the `InvariantBlockBackwardIterator` class in Chakra's JIT compiler.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect bound check elimination",
      "Flawed control flow graph traversal logic"
    ],
    "impact": "By exploiting the missing bound checks, an attacker may be able to trigger out-of-bounds memory access, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted JavaScript code",
      "Triggering JIT compilation"
     ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to execute JavaScript code in Microsoft Edge"
     ]
