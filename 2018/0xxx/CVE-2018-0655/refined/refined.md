Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0655:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue located within the app settings section of the admin page in GROWI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input before storing it, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed when a user views the app settings section of the admin page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts within the web browser of a logged-in user who views the vulnerable app settings section. This can lead to various attacks, including:
  - Stealing cookies and session tokens.
  - Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
  - Defacing the website or performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is conducted over the network, likely through a web browser.
- **Exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges needs to inject the malicious script in the app settings section of the admin page. When another user with the right privileges navigates to the app settings in the admin panel the injected malicious script will be executed on their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Privileges:** The attacker needs high privileges to access and modify the app settings section of the admin panel.
