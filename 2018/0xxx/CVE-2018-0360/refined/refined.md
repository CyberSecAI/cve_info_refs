**Attack vectors:**
-  A specially crafted HWP file is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted HWP file to ClamAV for scanning. This can be done remotely, depending on the context in which ClamAV is used.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Secunia Research at Flexera.
