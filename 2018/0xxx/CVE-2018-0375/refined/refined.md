Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-0375

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the presence of undocumented, static user credentials for the `root` account in the Cluster Manager of Cisco Policy Suite.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use of hard-coded credentials, specifically a default, static password for the `root` user account.
- Lack of proper access control, allowing remote login to a critical system using default credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated remote attacker can log in to the affected system as the `root` user.
- Successful login provides the attacker with complete control of the system, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands with `root` privileges. This can lead to complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote network access is the attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable system.
- No prior authentication or specific user privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker simply needs to know the default credentials.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Cisco Policy Suite releases prior to 18.2.0.
- Cisco has released a software update to address this issue (version 18.2.0 and later).
- There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability other than upgrading to a patched version.
