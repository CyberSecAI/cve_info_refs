{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Windows Desktop Bridge VFS (Virtual File System) filter driver (wcnfs.sys) does not properly check if a file request originates from kernel mode or user mode within the context of a Desktop Bridge application. It incorrectly relies on the process context of the application. This allows for redirection of system file access.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper privilege management in the VFS filter driver.",
      "Lack of validation for the origin of file access requests (kernel mode vs user mode).",
      "Insecure use of per-user DOS device prefix during reparse operations.",
	    "Incorrect trust of the process context for file access permissions."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can achieve privilege escalation by redirecting file access requests within a Desktop Bridge application's context. Specifically, they can force the NtGetNlsSectionPtr system call to map any file as read-only, bypassing file locking and potentially leading to arbitrary file reads or other more severe outcomes (e.g., loading arbitrary drivers or configuration data)",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local exploitation by leveraging the Desktop Bridge VFS functionality.",
      "Creation of a new process within the same Desktop Bridge container as an existing application that uses VFS. Alternatively, injection into such a process."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to execute code within the context of a Desktop Bridge application.",
      "Ability to create a fake VFS path drive by redirecting the root drive.",
      "Knowledge of the system call (e.g., NtGetNlsSectionPtr) that can be exploited to trigger the vulnerability."
