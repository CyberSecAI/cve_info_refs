"title": "Summary",
"text": "A vulnerability in the NX-API feature of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to craft a packet to the management interface on an affected system, causing a buffer overflow.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to incorrect input validation in the authentication module of the NX-API subsystem. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP or HTTPS packet to the management interface of an affected system with the NX-API feature enabled. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as root.\r\n\r\nNote: NX-API is disabled by default.\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180620-nxos-bo [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180620-nxos-bo\"]\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the June 2018 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Collection, which includes 24 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 24 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: June 2018 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Collection [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-67770\"]."

"text": "On Cisco Nexus devices, CLIs are run only on the device. NX-API improves the accessibility of these CLIs by making them available outside of the switch by using HTTP/HTTPS. NX-API supports show commands and configurations.\r\nThe vulnerability affects only NX-OS devices configured with the NX-API feature enabled. To exploit this vulnerability, a crafted packet would need to be sent to the management interface of an affected device.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a Nexus device is configured with NX-API enabled, administrators can use the show feature | include nxapi command from the NX-OS CLI and verify that it is enabled. The following example shows the NX-API feature enabled on a device running NX-OS Software:\r\n\r\n\r\nnxos-switch# show feature | include nxapi\r\nnxapi 1 enabled\r\n\r\nA configured management interface would look similar to the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nswitch# configure terminal\r\nswitch(config)# interface mgmt 0 switch(config)# ip address 192.168.100.1/24 switch(config)# vrf member managment switch(config)#"

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 9.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 9.8 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 9.8 |

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Firepower 2100 Series   + Firepower 4100 Series Next-Generation Firewall   + Firepower 9300 Security Appliance   + Nexus 1000V Series Switches   + Nexus 1100 Series Cloud Services Platforms   + Nexus 3600 Platform Switches   + Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode   + UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects Cisco has not investigated whether this vulnerability affects Cisco Nexus 4000 Series Switches, Cisco Nexus 5010 Switches, or Cisco Nexus 5020 Switches because those products have reached end-of-life status. For more information, refer to the [End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement for the Cisco Nexus 4000 Series Switch Modules for IBM BladeCenter](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/nexus-4000-series-switches/eos-eol-notice-c51-733205.html) and the [End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement for the Cisco Nexus 5010 and Nexus 5020 Switches](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/nexus-5000-series-switches/eol_c51-709037.html).  Details  * On Cisco Nexus devices, CLIs are run only on the device. NX-API improves the accessibility of these CLIs by making them available outside of the switch by using HTTP/HTTPS. NX-API supports **show** commands and configurations. The vulnerability affects only NX-OS devices configured with the NX-API feature enabled. To exploit this vulnerability, a crafted packet would need to be sent to the management interface of an affected device.  To determine whether a Nexus device is configured with NX-API enabled, administrators can use the **show feature | include nxapi** command from the NX-OS CLI and verify that it is enabled. The following example shows the NX-API feature enabled on a device running NX-OS Software:  ```   nxos-switch# show feature | include nxapi   nxapi                1        enabled   ```  A configured management interface would look similar to the following example:    ```   switch# configure terminal   switch(config)# interface mgmt 0   switch(config)# ip address 192.168.100.1/24   switch(config)# vrf member managment   switch(config)#   ```  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:      <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the applicable table in this section. To help ensure a complete upgrade solution, consider that this advisory is part of a collection. For a complete list of the advisories in the collection and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: June 2018 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Collection](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-67770).
