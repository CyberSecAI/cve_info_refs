Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-0301:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability is due to incorrect input validation within the authentication module of the NX-API subsystem in Cisco NX-OS Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   A buffer overflow vulnerability is present in the NX-API feature.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected system.
