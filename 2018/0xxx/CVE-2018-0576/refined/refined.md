**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-0576

**Vulnerable Software:** WordPress plugin "Events Manager" prior to version 5.9

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the Events Manager plugin, leading to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin allows users to inject malicious scripts that are then stored in the database and executed when other users access the affected areas.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary script execution: A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browsers of logged-in users of the website.
- Potential for data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious scripts through the plugin's input fields/functionalities.
- The injected scripts are stored in the database and executed when other users view the affected content.
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Low privileges: An attacker with low privileges (e.g., a logged-in user with event creation/modification rights) can exploit this vulnerability.
- User Interaction: The vulnerability requires a user to interact with the malicious content on the website (e.g., visit a page with the injected script).
