Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-0249:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of malformed or invalid 802.11 Association Requests by Cisco Aironet 1800 series access points that use Qualcomm Atheros (QCA) based hardware platforms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation: The access point fails to properly validate incoming 802.11 Association Requests, which allows malformed requests to trigger the vulnerability.
- Denial of Service (DoS): The improper handling of malformed requests leads to a denial of service condition on the affected system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service: A successful exploit can prevent new clients from joining the access point, effectively disrupting wireless service.
- The vulnerability affects only new client association requests, not existing connections.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Adjacent network: An attacker must be within the range of the affected access point's wireless signal to exploit the vulnerability.
- Unauthenticated: The attacker does not require authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
- Malicious 802.11 Association Requests: The attack involves sending a stream of malformed or invalid 802.11 Association Requests to the access point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be physically located within the wireless range of the targeted access point.
- The attacker does not require any user credentials or prior access to the network.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft and send malformed 802.11 Association Requests.

**Affected Products:**
- Cisco Aironet 1560 Series Access Points
- Cisco Aironet 1810 Series OfficeExtend Access Points
- Cisco Aironet 1810w Series Access Points
- Cisco Aironet 1815 Series Access Points
- Cisco Aironet 1830 Series Access Points
- Cisco Aironet 1850 Series Access Points

**Unaffected Products:**
- Cisco Aironet 2800 Series Access Points
- Cisco Aironet 3800 Series Access Points

**Additional Information:**
- There are no workarounds available.
- The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
- Cisco is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability.
