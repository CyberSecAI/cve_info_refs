- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The installer of Anshin net security for Windows has a DLL search path issue, leading to insecure loading of Dynamic Link Libraries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure DLL loading (CWE-427).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user who runs the installer.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker places a malicious DLL in the same directory as the installer. When the installer is executed, it loads the malicious DLL instead of the legitimate one.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick the user into placing a malicious DLL in the same directory as the installer. The user then needs to execute the installer.
