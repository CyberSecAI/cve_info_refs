Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0181:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper authentication when accessing the Redis server used by Cisco Policy Suite for Mobile and Cisco Policy Suite Diameter Routing Agent software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The Redis server allows access without requiring authentication. This lack of authentication allows an attacker to connect to the server.
- **Key-Value Pair Modification:**  An attacker can modify key-value pairs stored in the Redis server database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Reduced Efficiency:** Modification of key-value pairs can reduce the efficiency of Cisco Policy Suite for Mobile and Cisco Policy Suite Diameter Routing Agent software. The specific impact on functionality is not detailed.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:**  Modifying data within the Redis server could lead to unpredictable behaviors in the affected applications, potentially opening doors to further attacks depending on the application logic.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the Redis server over the network.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to provide any credentials to connect and interact with the Redis server.

**Summary:**
CVE-2018-0181 is an unauthenticated access vulnerability that allows a remote attacker to modify data stored in a Redis server used by Cisco Policy Suite for Mobile and Cisco Policy Suite Diameter Routing Agent software. The lack of authentication enables this access. The impact is reduced system efficiency and potential for other exploits due to data manipulation.
