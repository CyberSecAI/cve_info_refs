Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation within an operations script of Cisco UCS Central.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The core issue is the lack of proper validation of input data processed by an operation script, which allows an attacker to inject malicious commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the `daemon` user on the affected Cisco UCS Central system. This means the attacker gains significant control over the system.
*   **High Impact:** The CVSS score is 8.8 (High), due to the high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
*   **Network Attack Vector:** The attack vector is classified as network based (`AV:N`).
*   **Crafted Request:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the user interface of Cisco UCS Central.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication Required:** The attacker must be authenticated to the Cisco UCS Central system (`PR:L`).
*   **No User Interaction:** The attack does not require any user interaction (`UI:N`).

**Affected Products:**
*   Cisco UCS Central Software prior to Release 2.0(1c)

**Unaffected Products:**
*   Cisco UCS Manager

**Mitigation:**
*   Upgrade to Cisco UCS Central Release 2.0(1c) or later to address the vulnerability.
*   There are no workarounds.
