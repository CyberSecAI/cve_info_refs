## Description

[![@blowdart](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/796298?u=6aec6ec03b0449244b5eecbe1bc0bc0cdf7d75dd&v=4&size=48)](/blowdart)[blowdart](https://github.com/blowdart)opened [on Mar 13, 2018](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/295#issue-304854672)
# Microsoft Security Advisory [CVE-2018-0787](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-365p-96qv-xr7g "CVE-2018-0787"): ASP.NET Core Elevation Of Privilege Vulnerability

## Executive summary

Microsoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in ASP.NET Core versions 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0. This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.

Microsoft is aware of a security vulnerability in all public versions of ASP.NET Core where an elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when a ASP.NET Core web application fails to validate web requests correctly.

## Discussion

Discussion for this issue can be found at [dotnet/aspnetcore#2954](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/2954)

### Mitigation factors

Sites are not vulnerable to this elevation of privilege when:

* The site is hosted behind a proxy, such as Internet Information Services (IIS), NGINX, or Apache, where:

  + The proxy validates the host header, and
  + The proxy is configured to listen on fully qualified domain names or
  + The proxy is configured with a wildcard subdomain where the root domain is fully controlled by the site owner.

For example, if IIS is configured to respond to requests for `contoso.com` or `*.contoso.com` hosts, the application is protected.

If IIS is configured to respond to any request from any host, the application is vulnerable.

Kestrel does not have the capability to validate host headers and is vulnerable if not placed behind a proxy that performs the host header validation.

Apps hosted in Azure Web Apps are not susceptible to this vulnerability.

## Affected software

Any ASP.NET Core hosted application which is directly exposed to the internet, or hosted behind a proxy which does not validate or restict host headers to known good values.

The vulnerability also affects any ASP.NET Core 2.0 project if it uses the following package versions, which must also be [updated](#app-update), in addition to addressing your proxy configuration :

| Package name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides | 2.0.0, 2.0.1 | 2.0.2 and later |
| Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core | 2.0.0, 2.0.1 | 2.0.2 and later |

*No patches are available for ASP.NET Core 1.0.x or ASP.NET Core 1.1.x. Microsoft requires that you place your 1.x ASP.NET Core application behind a proxy.

You must address the configuration of your proxy to protect your application. If you're not running ASP.NET Core 1.x behind a proxy, you must either place a proxy in front of your application or upgrade to ASP.NET Core 2.0.

and add the host validating middleware provided at <https://github.com/aspnet/BasicMiddleware/blob/release/2.0/samples/HostFilteringSample/>.*

## Advisory FAQ

### How do I know if I am affected?

Review the server and proxy configuration [instructions](#configuration) below to see if your system is configured correctly, and adjust the configuration if necessary.

### How do I fix the issue?

You must address the [configuration](#configuration) of your server or proxy to protect your application to limit requests to known hosts.

If you're not running Kestrel 1.x behind a proxy, you must either place a proxy in front of your application or upgrade to ASP.NET Core 2.0 and follow the 2.0 instructions below.

ASP.NET Core 2.0.x applications must [update your code](#app-update) to fully protect your application.

#### Server and Proxy configuration

You must examine your externally facing server or proxy configuration and ensure it requires host headers with fully qualified domain names, or known sub-domains if you are using sub-domain wild cards.

##### ASP.NET Core applications behind [IIS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/iis/)

To configure IIS to only respond to know hosts:

* Open IIS Manager.
* Expand the **Sites** node for the machine you want to configure.
* Select the site by clicking on the site.
* In the **Actions** list on the right-hand side of IIS Manager, click **Bindings**.
* Edit any bindings that do not have a host name to specify one. Do not use a `*` wildcard unless it's against a domain under your control. For example, `*.contoso.com` is safe, `*.com` is not.

##### ASP.NET Core applications running publicly on [Kestrel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel)

Kestrel does not have the capability to validate host headers. It must either be placed behind a proxy that performs the host header validation or the validation must be performed within the application by adding host filtering middleware provided at <https://github.com/aspnet/BasicMiddleware/blob/release/2.0/samples/HostFilteringSample/>. You must also [update your dependencies](#app-update) to fully protect your application.

##### ASP.NET Core applications running on [HTTP.SYS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/httpsys)

To configure URL prefixes and ports, you can use the `UseUrls` extension method, the `urls` command-line argument, the ASPNETCORE\_URLS environment variable, or the `UrlPrefixes` property on [HttpSysOptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.httpsys.httpsysoptions). The following code example uses `UrlPrefixes`.

```
public static IWebHost BuildWebHost(string[] args) =>
    WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .UseStartup<Startup>()
        .UseHttpSys(options =>
        {
            // The following options are set to default values.
            options.Authentication.Schemes = AuthenticationSchemes.None;
            options.Authentication.AllowAnonymous = true;
            options.MaxConnections = null;
            options.MaxRequestBodySize = 30000000;
            options.UrlPrefixes.Add("http://localhost:5000");
        })
        .Build();
```
##### ASP.NET Core applications behind [NGINX](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/linux-nginx)

To configure NGINX as a reverse proxy to forward requests to your ASP.NET Core app, replace the contents */etc/nginx/sites-available/default* with the following:

```
server {
    listen        80;
    server_name   example.com *.example.com;
    location / {
        proxy_pass         http://localhost:5000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header   Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header   Connection keep-alive;
        proxy_set_header   Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

Note that with NGINX, when there is no match for `server_name`, NGINX will pick the default server. If no default server has been defined, the first server in the conf file is the default server. Best practice is to add a specific default server which returns a status code of 444 in the conf file. An example default server configuration would be as follows:

```
server {
    listen   80 default_server;
    # listen [::]:80 default_server deferred;
    return   444;
}
```

With the preceding configuration file and default server, NGINX accepts public traffic on port 80 with host header `example.com` or `*.example.com`. Requests not matching these hosts won't get forwarded to Kestrel. NGINX forwards the matching requests to Kestrel at `http://localhost:5000`. See [How nginx processes a request](https://nginx.org/docs/http/request_processing.html) for more information.

Once the NGINX configuration is established, run `sudo nginx -t` to verify the syntax of the configuration files. If the configuration file test is successful, force NGINX to pick up the changes by running `sudo nginx -s reload`.

##### ASP.NET Core applications behind [Apache](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/linux-apache)

Configuration files for Apache are located within the `/etc/httpd/conf.d/` directory. Any file with the `*.conf*` extension:

* Is processed in alphabetical order, and
* The module configuration files in `/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/` are processed. The module configuration files in `/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/` contain any configuration files necessary to load modules.

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:5000/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:5000/
    ServerName www.example.com
    ServerAlias *.example.com
</VirtualHost>

```

The `VirtualHost` block can appear multiple times, in one or more files on a server. In the preceding configuration file, Apache accepts public traffic on port 80. The domain `www.example.com` is being served, and the `*.example.com` alias resolves to the same website. See [Name-based virtual host support](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/vhosts/name-based.html) for more information. Requests are proxied at the root to port 5000 of the server at 127.0.0.1. For bi-directional communication, `ProxyPass` and `ProxyPassReverse` are required.

Save the file and test the configuration. If everything passes, the response is `Syntax [OK]`.

```
sudo service httpd configtest
```

Restart Apache:

```
sudo systemctl restart httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
```
#### ASP.NET Core 2.0 application code updates

---

If you're targeting .NET Core 2.x and the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` "metapackage":

* Update its version number to 2.0.6 or later.
* Updating will pull in the fixed packages listed above.

If you're targeting .NET Framework, update the packages listed above to their safe version or later.

If your application is using Kestrel without a proxy or the HttpOverrides functionality (UseForwardedHeaders with ForwardedHost) you must also add the host filtering middleware provided at <https://github.com/aspnet/BasicMiddleware/tree/release/2.0/samples/HostFilteringSample/>.

---

.NET Core and ASP.NET Core have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. You must follow the update instructions below to address both types of dependency.

### Direct dependencies

Direct dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project. For example, if you add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to your project then you have taken a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`.

Direct dependencies are discoverable by examining your *csproj* file.

### Transitive dependencies

Transitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if you add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to your project it depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package (among others). Your project has a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` and a transitive dependency on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package.

Transitive dependencies are reviewable:

* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.
* By examining the *project.assets.json* file contained in the obj directory of your project.

The *project.assets.json* files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.

##### Fixing direct dependencies â Projects targeting .NET Core

Open *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the content menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:

```
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.All" Version="2.0.5" />
  </ItemGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <DotNetCliToolReference Include="Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools" Version="2.0.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

The preceding example has a reference to the vulnerable metapackage, as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute. The package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` version 2.0.5.

To update the version to the secure package, change the version number to a secure package version. In this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` to 2.0.6 or later. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:

```
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.All" Version="2.0.6" />
  </ItemGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <DotNetCliToolReference Include="Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools" Version="2.0.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

If you're using Visual Studio and save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.

If you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.

##### Fixing direct dependencies â Projects targeting .NET Framework

Open *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the content menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` nodes. The following shows an example project file:

```
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides" Version="2.0.1" />
  </ItemGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <DotNetCliToolReference Include="Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools" Version="2.0.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

The example has a reference to a single package, as seen by the `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute. The package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The example shows a direct dependency on one of the vulnerable packages from the table above, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides` version 2.0.1.

To update to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version. In the example, this would be updating `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides` to 2.0.2 and later. Save the *csproj* file. The updated and secure *csproj* look as follows:

```
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides" Version="2.0.2" />
  </ItemGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <DotNetCliToolReference Include="Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools" Version="2.0.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

If you're using Visual Studio and save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.

If you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependency version.

##### After updating your direct dependencies

Recompile your application.

If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to a compatible version.

For example if your project refers directly to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors` with a version number of `2.0.0`, when you update your `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to 2.0.1, compilation will throw:

`NU1012 Dependency conflict. Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc 2.0.1 expected Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors >= 2.0.1 but received 2.0.0`

To fix this, edit the version for the expected package to be the version expected by updating your *project.json* in the same way that you used to update the vulnerable package versions.

After you've addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must review your transitive dependencies.

###### Reviewing transitive dependencies

There are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either use Visual Studioâs Solution Explorer, or you can review the *project.assets.json* file.

###### Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer

To use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio 2017, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for each of the vulnerable package names above and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.

For example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:

[![vs2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)

The search results appear as a tree. In these results, you can see a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.

Under the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions. In this example, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions. In the example, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a vulnerable version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.

###### Manually reviewing project.assets.json (VS2017)

Open the *project.assets.json* file from your projectâs obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file. Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.

Search the *project.assets.json* file for each of the vulnerable packages, using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:

* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.
* Compare to the vulnerable versions table above.

For example, a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors/1.1.0` is a reference to v1.1.0 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors`. If your *project.assets.json* file includes references to any of the vulnerable packages shown above, then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.

###### Overriding transitive dependencies

If you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages this means:

* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or
* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.

If your transitive dependency review found references to any of the vulnerable packages you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.

Open *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the content menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:

```
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet" Version="2.0.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <DotNetCliToolReference Include="Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools" Version="2.0.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

For each of the vulnerable packages your search returned, you must add a direct dependency to the updated version by adding it to the *csproj* file.

You do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referring the fixed version.

For example, if your search showed a transitive reference to the vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides` version 2.0.0 you would add a reference to the fixed version, that is, 2.0.2 or later.

```
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverride" Version="2.0.2" />
    <PackageReference Include="ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet" Version="2.0.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <DotNetCliToolReference Include="Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools" Version="2.0.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

After you have added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.

If you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.

You can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.

If you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.

## Description

[![@blowdart](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/796298?u=6aec6ec03b0449244b5eecbe1bc0bc0cdf7d75dd&v=4&size=48)](/blowdart)[blowdart](https://github.com/blowdart)opened [on Mar 13, 2018](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/295#issue-304854672)
# Microsoft Security Advisory [CVE-2018-0787](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-365p-96qv-xr7g "CVE-2018-0787"): ASP.NET Core Elevation Of Privilege Vulnerability

## Executive summary

Microsoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in ASP.NET Core versions 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0. This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.

Microsoft is aware of a security vulnerability in all public versions of ASP.NET Core where an elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when a ASP.NET Core web application fails to validate web requests correctly.

## Discussion

Discussion for this issue can be found at [dotnet/aspnetcore#2954](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/2954)

### Mitigation factors

Sites are not vulnerable to this elevation of privilege when:

* The site is hosted behind a proxy, such as Internet Information Services (IIS), NGINX, or Apache, where:

  + The proxy validates the host header, and
  + The proxy is configured to listen on fully qualified domain names or
  + The proxy is configured with a wildcard subdomain where the root domain is fully controlled by the site owner.

For example, if IIS is configured to respond to requests for `contoso.com` or `*.contoso.com` hosts, the application is protected.

If IIS is configured to respond to any request from any host, the application is vulnerable.

Kestrel does not have the capability to validate host headers and is vulnerable if not placed behind a proxy that performs the host header validation.

Apps hosted in Azure Web Apps are not susceptible to this vulnerability.

## Affected software

Any ASP.NET Core hosted application which is directly exposed to the internet, or hosted behind a proxy which does not validate or restict host headers to known good values.

The vulnerability also affects any ASP.NET Core 2.0 project if it uses the following package versions, which must also be [updated](#app-update), in addition to addressing your proxy configuration :

| Package name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides | 2.0.0, 2.0.1 | 2.0.2 and later |
| Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core | 2.0.0, 2.0.1 | 2.0.2 and later |

*No patches are available for ASP.NET Core 1.0.x or ASP.NET Core 1.1.x. Microsoft requires that you place your 1.x ASP.NET Core application behind a proxy.

You must address the configuration of your proxy to protect your application. If you're not running ASP.NET Core 1.x behind a proxy, you must either place a proxy in front of your application or upgrade to ASP.NET Core 2.0.

and add the host validating middleware provided at <https://github.com/aspnet/BasicMiddleware/blob/release/2.0/samples/HostFilteringSample/>.*

## Advisory FAQ

### How do I know if I am affected?

Review the server and proxy configuration [instructions](#configuration) below to see if your system is configured correctly, and adjust the configuration if necessary.

### How do I fix the issue?

You must address the [configuration](#configuration) of your server or proxy to protect your application to limit requests to known hosts.

If you're not running Kestrel 1.x behind a proxy, you must either place a proxy in front of your application or upgrade to ASP.NET Core 2.0 and follow the 2.0 instructions below.

ASP.NET Core 2.0.x applications must [update your code](#app-update) to fully protect your application.

#### Server and Proxy configuration

You must examine your externally facing server or proxy configuration and ensure it requires host headers with fully qualified domain names, or known sub-domains if you are using sub-domain wild cards.

##### ASP.NET Core applications behind [IIS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/iis/)

To configure IIS to only respond to know hosts:

* Open IIS Manager.
* Expand the **Sites** node for the machine you want to configure.
* Select the site by clicking on the site.
* In the **Actions** list on the right-hand side of IIS Manager, click **Bindings**.
* Edit any bindings that do not have a host name to specify one. Do not use a `*` wildcard unless it's against a domain under your control. For example, `*.contoso.com` is safe, `*.com` is not.

##### ASP.NET Core applications running publicly on [Kestrel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel)

Kestrel does not have the capability to validate host headers. It must either be placed behind a proxy that performs the host header validation or the validation must be performed within the application by adding host filtering middleware provided at <https://github.com/aspnet/BasicMiddleware/blob/release/2.0/samples/HostFilteringSample/>. You must also [update your dependencies](#app-update) to fully protect your application.

##### ASP.NET Core applications running on [HTTP.SYS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/httpsys)

To configure URL prefixes and ports, you can use the `UseUrls` extension method, the `urls` command-line argument, the ASPNETCORE\_URLS environment variable, or the `UrlPrefixes` property on [HttpSysOptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.httpsys.httpsysoptions). The following code example uses `UrlPrefixes`.

```
public static IWebHost BuildWebHost(string[] args) =>
    WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .UseStartup<Startup>()
        .UseHttpSys(options =>
        {
            // The following options are set to default values.
            options.Authentication.Schemes = AuthenticationSchemes.None;
            options.Authentication.AllowAnonymous = true;
            options.MaxConnections = null;
            options.MaxRequestBodySize = 30000000;
            options.UrlPrefixes.Add("http://localhost:5000");
        })
        .Build();
```
##### ASP.NET Core applications behind [NGINX](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/linux-nginx)

To configure NGINX as a reverse proxy to forward requests to your ASP.NET Core app, replace the contents */etc/nginx/sites-available/default* with the following:

```
server {
    listen        80;
    server_name   example.com *.example.com;
    location / {
        proxy_pass         http://localhost:5000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header   Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header   Connection keep-alive;
        proxy_set_header   Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

Note that with NGINX, when there is no match for `server_name`, NGINX will pick the default server. If no default server has been defined, the first server in the conf file is the default server. Best practice is to add a specific default server which returns a status code of 444 in the conf file. An example default server configuration would be as follows:

```
server {
    listen   80 default_server;
    # listen [::]:80 default_server deferred;
    return   444;
}
```

With the preceding configuration file and default server, NGINX accepts public traffic on port 80 with host header `example.com` or `*.example.com`. Requests not matching these hosts won't get forwarded to Kestrel. NGINX forwards the matching requests to Kestrel at `http://localhost:5000`. See [How nginx processes a request](https://nginx.org/docs/http/request_processing.html) for more information.

Once the NGINX configuration is established, run `sudo nginx -t` to verify the syntax of the configuration files. If the configuration file test is successful, force NGINX to pick up the changes by running `sudo nginx -s reload`.

##### ASP.NET Core applications behind [Apache](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/linux-apache)

Configuration files for Apache are located within the `/etc/httpd/conf.d/` directory. Any file with the `*.conf*` extension:

* Is processed in alphabetical order, and
* The module configuration files in `/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/` are processed. The module configuration files in `/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/` contain any configuration files necessary to load modules.

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:5000/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:5000/
    ServerName www.example.com
    ServerAlias *.example.com
</VirtualHost>

```

The `VirtualHost` block can appear multiple times, in one or more files on a server. In the preceding configuration file, Apache accepts public traffic on port 80. The domain `www.example.com` is being served, and the `*.example.com` alias resolves to the same website. See [Name-based virtual host support](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/vhosts/name-based.html) for more information. Requests are proxied at the root to port 5000 of the server at 127.0.0.1. For bi-directional communication, `ProxyPass` and `ProxyPassReverse` are required.

Save the file and test the configuration. If everything passes, the response is `Syntax [OK]`.

```
sudo service httpd configtest
```

Restart Apache:

```
sudo systemctl restart httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
```
#### ASP.NET Core 2.0 application code updates

---

If you're targeting .NET Core 2.x and the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` "metapackage":

* Update its version number to 2.0.6 or later.
* Updating will pull in the fixed packages listed above.

If you're targeting .NET Framework, update the packages listed above to their safe version or later.

If your application is using Kestrel without a proxy or the HttpOverrides functionality (UseForwardedHeaders with ForwardedHost) you must also add the host filtering middleware provided at <https://github.com/aspnet/BasicMiddleware/tree/release/2.0/samples/HostFilteringSample/>.

---

.NET Core and ASP.NET Core have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. You must follow the update instructions below to address both types of dependency.

### Direct dependencies

Direct dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project. For example, if you add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to your project then you have taken a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`.

Direct dependencies are discoverable by examining your *csproj* file.

### Transitive dependencies

Transitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if you add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to your project it depends on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package (among others). Your project has a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` and a transitive dependency on the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` package.

Transitive dependencies are reviewable:

* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.
* By examining the *project.assets.json* file contained in the obj directory of your project.

The *project.assets.json* files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.

##### Fixing direct dependencies â Projects targeting .NET Core

Open *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the content menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:

```
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.All" Version="2.0.5" />
  </ItemGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <DotNetCliToolReference Include="Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools" Version="2.0.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

The preceding example has a reference to the vulnerable metapackage, as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute. The package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` version 2.0.5.

To update the version to the secure package, change the version number to a secure package version. In this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.All` to 2.0.6 or later. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:

```
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.All" Version="2.0.6" />
  </ItemGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <DotNetCliToolReference Include="Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools" Version="2.0.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

If you're using Visual Studio and save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.

If you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.

##### Fixing direct dependencies â Projects targeting .NET Framework

Open *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the content menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` nodes. The following shows an example project file:

```
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides" Version="2.0.1" />
  </ItemGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <DotNetCliToolReference Include="Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools" Version="2.0.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

The example has a reference to a single package, as seen by the `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute. The package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The example shows a direct dependency on one of the vulnerable packages from the table above, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides` version 2.0.1.

To update to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version. In the example, this would be updating `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides` to 2.0.2 and later. Save the *csproj* file. The updated and secure *csproj* look as follows:

```
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides" Version="2.0.2" />
  </ItemGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <DotNetCliToolReference Include="Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools" Version="2.0.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

If you're using Visual Studio and save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. You can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.

If you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependency version.

##### After updating your direct dependencies

Recompile your application.

If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to a compatible version.

For example if your project refers directly to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors` with a version number of `2.0.0`, when you update your `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package to 2.0.1, compilation will throw:

`NU1012 Dependency conflict. Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc 2.0.1 expected Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors >= 2.0.1 but received 2.0.0`

To fix this, edit the version for the expected package to be the version expected by updating your *project.json* in the same way that you used to update the vulnerable package versions.

After you've addressed all of your direct dependencies, you must review your transitive dependencies.

###### Reviewing transitive dependencies

There are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either use Visual Studioâs Solution Explorer, or you can review the *project.assets.json* file.

###### Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer

To use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio 2017, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for each of the vulnerable package names above and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.

For example, searching for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` in an example project that contains a package that takes a dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` shows the following results in Visual Studio 2017:

[![vs2017](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/796298/25858816/8ecdc2b4-3491-11e7-9363-746804bb9832.png)

The search results appear as a tree. In these results, you can see a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core` version 1.1.2 is discovered.

Under the Dependencies node is a NuGet node. Under the NuGet node is the list of packages you have directly taken a dependency on and their versions. In this example, the application takes a direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`. `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` in turn has leaf nodes that list its dependencies and their versions. In the example, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc` package takes a dependency on a version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ApiExplorer`, that in turn takes a dependency on a vulnerable version of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`.

###### Manually reviewing project.assets.json (VS2017)

Open the *project.assets.json* file from your projectâs obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file. Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.

Search the *project.assets.json* file for each of the vulnerable packages, using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:

* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.
* Compare to the vulnerable versions table above.

For example, a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors/1.1.0` is a reference to v1.1.0 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Cors`. If your *project.assets.json* file includes references to any of the vulnerable packages shown above, then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.

###### Overriding transitive dependencies

If you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages this means:

* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or
* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.

If your transitive dependency review found references to any of the vulnerable packages you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.

Open *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the content menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:

```
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet" Version="2.0.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <DotNetCliToolReference Include="Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools" Version="2.0.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

For each of the vulnerable packages your search returned, you must add a direct dependency to the updated version by adding it to the *csproj* file.

You do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referring the fixed version.

For example, if your search showed a transitive reference to the vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides` version 2.0.0 you would add a reference to the fixed version, that is, 2.0.2 or later.

```
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverride" Version="2.0.2" />
    <PackageReference Include="ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet" Version="2.0.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <DotNetCliToolReference Include="Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Tools" Version="2.0.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

After you have added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.

If you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.

You can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.

If you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.
