{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-ID": "CVE-2018-0787",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from ASP.NET Core web applications failing to properly validate host headers in web requests.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of host headers in web requests"
    ],
    "Impact": "Elevation of privilege vulnerability. An attacker could potentially gain elevated privileges by exploiting the lack of proper host header validation.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited through network requests that target ASP.NET Core applications that do not properly validate host headers. This can occur if the application is directly exposed to the internet or is behind a proxy that doesn't perform the necessary host header validation.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send web requests to a vulnerable ASP.NET Core application. No specific user interaction is required, however, an attacker is required to craft the request to exploit the vulnerability."
  },
  "Affected software": [
    "ASP.NET Core versions 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0 when not hosted behind a properly configured proxy.",
    "ASP.NET Core 2.0 projects using Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1",
    "ASP.NET Core 2.0 projects using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1"
    ],
    "Mitigation": [
    "For ASP.NET Core applications behind a proxy (IIS, NGINX, Apache): Configure the proxy to validate host headers and to only respond to requests with fully qualified domain names or known subdomains. Avoid wildcard host header configurations unless the root domain is fully controlled.",
     "For ASP.NET Core applications running on Kestrel: Place Kestrel behind a proxy that performs host header validation or add host filtering middleware to the application.",
     "For ASP.NET Core applications using HTTP.SYS: Configure URL prefixes and ports using UseUrls extension method, the urls command-line argument, the ASPNETCORE_URLS environment variable, or the UrlPrefixes property on HttpSysOptions.",
    "Update the Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides and Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core packages to versions 2.0.2 or later for ASP.NET Core 2.0 applications.",
      "For applications targeting .NET Core 2.x and using the Microsoft.AspNetCore.All metapackage, update to version 2.0.6 or later.",
      "For applications targeting .NET Framework, update the vulnerable packages to their secure versions or later.",
       "If using Kestrel without a proxy or HttpOverrides functionality (UseForwardedHeaders with ForwardedHost), add the host filtering middleware provided at <https://github.com/aspnet/BasicMiddleware/tree/release/2.0/samples/HostFilteringSample/>."
