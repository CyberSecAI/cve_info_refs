Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2018-0482
*   **Vulnerable Product:** Cisco Prime Network Control System
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface.
*   **Weakness:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Attack Vector:** A remote, authenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to persuade a user of the web interface to click a malicious link.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a valid user account on the Cisco Prime Network Control System.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Execution of arbitrary script code within the context of the web-based management interface.
    *   Access to sensitive browser-based information by the attacker.
*   **Workarounds:** None available.
*  **Fixed Software:** Software updates are available to address this vulnerability, refer to the Cisco bug ID (CSCvj92813) for specific release information.

**Summary of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a stored XSS issue. An authenticated attacker can inject malicious script code through user-supplied input within the web-based management interface. When another user interacts with the malicious data (e.g., by clicking a link), the script executes in the user's browser, potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions as the victim user.
