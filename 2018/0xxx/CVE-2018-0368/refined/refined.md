**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insufficient security restrictions on log files within Cisco DNA Center software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unprotected log files are accessible to local users.
- Sensitive information, including potentially system credentials, is logged in these unprotected files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can access sensitive log files.
- Disclosure of system credentials, potentially leading to further unauthorized access and privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access to the system is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker accesses unprotected log files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated local user on the affected Cisco DNA Center system.

**Summary of the vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is an information disclosure issue in Cisco DNA Center, where insufficient restrictions on log files allow an authenticated, local attacker to access sensitive information, potentially including system credentials. This is caused by the lack of proper access controls on the log files.
