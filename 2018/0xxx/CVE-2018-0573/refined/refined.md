Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0573:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly restrict access to files uploaded via the file uploader after their designated public availability period has expired. Specifically, if the baserCMS installation is not performed correctly, it is possible to access files even after their expiry date by directly specifying the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Access Control Failure:** The core weakness is the lack of proper access control enforcement. The system fails to prevent access to expired content when accessed directly via URL. This is due to a flawed implementation of the public expiry date functionality within the file uploader.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can bypass the intended access restrictions and view files that were supposed to be no longer publicly accessible. This can lead to the exposure of sensitive or confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Access:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by directly accessing the URL of a file that was uploaded via the file uploader even if the public expiry date is over.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No special access is required:** An attacker does not need to log into the system.
*   **Knowledge of URL:** The attacker needs to know or guess the exact URL of the uploaded file, which can be challenging if not publicly linked elsewhere on the site. However, the URL structure might be predictable or guessable.
*   **Failed Installation:** This vulnerability only exists if the baserCMS installation had some issue that resulted in the access restrictions not being properly configured.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided content indicates that this vulnerability only exists when baserCMS is not installed correctly.
*   The JVN entry provides a CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) and CVSS v2 base score of 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) for this issue.
