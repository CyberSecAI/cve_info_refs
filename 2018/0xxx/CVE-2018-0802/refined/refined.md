        "root_cause": "A long font name in an RTF file overflows a 32-byte buffer on the stack when copied using strcpy in the Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE). Specifically, the lfFaceName buffer in a LOGFONTA structure allocated on the stack is overflowed when a long font name is copied into it.",
        "weakness": "Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when copying a long font name.",
        "impact": "Remote code execution. The overflow can overwrite the return address on the stack, allowing the attacker to redirect program execution to arbitrary code. In this case, the attacker was able to reliably launch the calculator application as a proof of concept.",
         "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is triggered by opening a crafted RTF file containing a malicious equation object with a long font name.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can create a malicious RTF file. The attacker needs to be able to get a user to open the crafted RTF file."

The code copies an amount of data (controlled by variables v12\\v13) to an address (pointed to by local variables v6 and v8) on the stack, without proper bounds checking, allowing overwrite of EIP.",
        "weakness": "Stack-based buffer overflow due to improper handling of the SIZE record. The function copies data to stack-based buffers based on user-controlled length values (v12 and v13) without proper size checks, resulting in an overflow.",

         "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft a malicious RTF file with specific values for v12 and v13 in the Equation OLE object's SIZE record to cause a stack buffer overflow. Additionally, an attacker must bypass ASLR in the process."
