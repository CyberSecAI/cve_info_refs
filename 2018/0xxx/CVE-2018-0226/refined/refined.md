Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-0226:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how Cisco Mobility Express software configures default SSH user accounts for access points.
*   Specifically, when an administrator adds user accounts directly to the Mobility Express controller (instead of using the default configuration or the SSH username creation wizard), the software sets the *first created* SSH user account as the default SSH user for access points.
*   Although this first created account is meant to have read-only privileges for the Mobility Express controller itself, it can inadvertently receive administrative privileges on associated access points.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Privilege Assignment:** The core issue is the misconfiguration where an account intended for read-only access on the controller is granted administrative privileges on the access points.
*   **Default Account Mismanagement:** The vulnerability is triggered by the software's incorrect handling of default SSH user account assignment.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A remote attacker, authenticated on the Mobility Express controller with a low-privileged account, can gain administrative privileges on an access point.
*   **Arbitrary Administrative Actions:** With escalated privileges, the attacker can log in to the access point via SSH with full administrative rights and perform any administrative action.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
*   **SSH:** The attack vector is via Secure Shell (SSH).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Controller Credentials:** The attacker needs valid user credentials for an affected Cisco Mobility Express controller.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the controller and the vulnerable access point.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability affects Cisco Aironet 1800, 2800, and 3800 Series Access Points running specific versions of Cisco Mobility Express Software.
*   There are no workarounds available.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
