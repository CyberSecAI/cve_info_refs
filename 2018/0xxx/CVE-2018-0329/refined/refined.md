Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the default configuration of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) feature within Cisco Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) Software. Specifically, a hard-coded, read-only community string is present in the configuration file for the SNMP daemon.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Hard-coded Credentials:** The use of a static, hard-coded community string for SNMP access is a significant weakness. This eliminates the need for an attacker to guess or brute-force credentials.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to exploit the static community string.
- **Exposure of SNMP Data:** The SNMP daemon uses the static community string, allowing an attacker to read data that is accessible via SNMP.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can read any data accessible through SNMP on the affected Cisco WAAS device. This could include sensitive system information, network configurations, performance statistics, and other data.
- The confidentiality of the information is compromised since the attacker can read the data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network.
- **SNMP Queries:** The attacker uses the static community string in SNMP version 2c queries to access the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the affected Cisco WAAS device.
- **SNMP Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of the SNMP protocol and how to send queries.
- **No Authentication Required**: The attacker doesn't need any prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability, due to the hardcoded community string.

**Additional Notes:**
- The hard-coded credentials are in an internal configuration file, not visible in the running or startup configurations.
- There are no workarounds to address this vulnerability.
- Cisco has released software updates to fix the issue.
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials).
- The CVSS v3 base score is 5.3 (Medium severity).
