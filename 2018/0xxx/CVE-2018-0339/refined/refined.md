Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of certain parameters passed to the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The lack of proper input validation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary script code within the context of the web interface.
- The attacker could potentially access sensitive browser-based information belonging to users of the interface.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to convince a user of the Cisco ISE web-based management interface to click on a specially crafted link.
- The attack is conducted remotely and does not require prior authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to craft a malicious link that, when clicked, will execute the injected script.
- The attacker must be able to socially engineer or otherwise trick a user into clicking the malicious link.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting).
- The CVSS v3 score is 6.1 (Medium) with vector string "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N".
- There are no workarounds to address the vulnerability.
- Cisco has released software updates to remediate the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered through internal security testing.
- Cisco is not aware of any public exploitation of this vulnerability.
