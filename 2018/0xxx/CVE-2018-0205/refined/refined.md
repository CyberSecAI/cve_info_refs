Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0205:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to improper input validation in the User Provisioning tab of the Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning Tool.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web application. This is a client-side attack where the victim's browser executes the malicious script.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could access the Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning Tool by injecting crafted data into the database. This implies that a successful XSS attack could lead to:
    - Account compromise
    - Data theft or manipulation
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects a malicious string into the Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning database. This suggests the attacker needs a way to write to the database, possibly through an exposed API or through an authenticated user account if privilege escalation is possible.
- The injected malicious string is then rendered on the user's browser through the User Provisioning tab, thus executing the script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated for the initial injection.
- The attacker needs a method to inject data into the Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning database.
- The attack is remote.
- The attacker relies on the victim's browser to execute the malicious script. User interaction is required, as the victim has to load the malicious data from the database through the User Provisioning Tab.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects the Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning Tool.
- There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.
- Cisco has released software updates to fix this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
- CVSS v3 score is 4.7 (Medium). The vector string is CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
- CWE-79 is associated with this CVE, which corresponds to "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')."
