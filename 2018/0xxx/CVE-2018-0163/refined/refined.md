Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A logic change error introduced into the code during a software regression.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  Improper access control in the 802.1x multiple-authentication (multi-auth) feature of Cisco IOS Software.
-  The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the authentication phase on an 802.1x multi-auth port.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker can bypass 802.1x access controls.
- Successful exploitation grants the attacker access to the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Adjacent network access. An attacker must be in the same network segment as the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be adjacent to the affected Cisco device, with network access to the 802.1x multi-auth port.
- The attacker needs to attempt access to the port after a successful supplicant has authenticated.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Cisco IOS Software when configured with 802.1x in multi-auth mode.
- There are no workarounds to mitigate the vulnerability, requiring a software update.
- The vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
- Cisco IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software are not affected by this vulnerability.
