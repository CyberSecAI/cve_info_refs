Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0327:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of certain parameters passed to the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) web framework via HTTP GET and HTTP POST methods.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The lack of proper input validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary script or HTML code into the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker who can trick a user into following a malicious link can execute arbitrary script or HTML code in the user's browser within the context of the affected website. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Defacement of the web page
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Other malicious actions within the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), meaning an attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
*   The attack requires user interaction (UI:R). The attacker must convince a user to click a malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious link with the injected script.
*   The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to click the malicious link.
*   The attacker does not need any prior privileges (PR:N) on the targeted system.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability affects Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE).
*   There are no known workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
*   The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is CWE-79, which corresponds to Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting').
*   The CVSS v3 base score is 6.1 which is considered medium severity
