Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.      This advisory is available at the following link:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-20180718-nexus-9000-dos>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI Mode running software version 13.0(1k).  The vulnerability can only be exploited when unicast routing is enabled on the Bridge Domain (BD). DHCP and DHCP relay do not have to be configured for the vulnerability to be exploited.  **Determining the NX-OS Software Release**      Administrators can check the version of NX-OS Software running on their device by using the **show version** command from the device CLI. The following example identifies the **11.2(2)** release:  ```   nxos-n9k-aci# show version   Cisco Nexus Operating System (NX-OS) Software   such license is available at   http://www.opensource.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.php and   http://www.opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.php   Software     BIOS:      version N/A     kickstart: version 11.2(2) [build 11.2(1.184)]     system:    version 11.2(2) [build 11.2(1.184)]   ``` **Determining the APIC Software Release**   There is a one-to-one mapping between the software for Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI Mode. To determine what Cisco APIC release is in use, administrators can remove the leftmost **1** from the Cisco NX-OS Software version number. In the previous example, the Cisco APIC Software version is 1.2(2). **Determining Whether Unicast Routing is Enabled**  Administrators can check whether unicast routing is enabled on their   device by using the following command from the device CLI:  ```   nxos-n9k-aci# moquery -d uni/tn-ag/BD-bd1 | egrep "unicastRoute"unicastRoute             : yes   ``` Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-20180718-nexus-9000-dos#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has determined that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Firepower 2100 Series   + Firepower 4100 Series Next-Generation Firewall   + Firepower 9300 Security Appliance   + MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Director Switches   + Nexus 1000V Series Switches   + Nexus 1100 Series Cloud Services Platforms   + Nexus 2000 Series Switches   + Nexus 3000 Series Switches   + Nexus 3500 Platform Switches   + Nexus 3600 Platform Switches   + Nexus 5000 Series Switches   + Nexus 5500 Platform Switches   + Nexus 5600 Platform Switches   + Nexus 7000 Series Switches   + Nexus 7700 Series Switches   + Nexus 9000 Series Switches in NX-OS mode   + Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules   + UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects  Indicators of Compromise  * Exploitation of this vulnerability could cause the affected device to reload and write a core file. Contact Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to review the core file and confirm whether it was due to this vulnerability.  To verify the current status of the virtual memory usage, administrators can enter the command **ps aux | grep 'dhcp\_snoop\|VSZ'**   from the leaf node prompt. If the displayed value exceeds 3 GB, a reboot   should be performed to prevent an unplanned device restart. The following example shows a device that has not reached the 3 GB value for the Virtual Memory Size (VSZ):  ```   nxos-n9k-aci# ps aux | grep 'dhcp_snoop\|VSZ'USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMANDroot     13225  0.0  1.5 1712896 382940 ?

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high number of malicious DHCPv6 packets to be processed by an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the system to run low on memory, which could cause an eventual reboot of an affected device. The vulnerability only applies to IPv6 protocol packets and not for IPv4 protocol packets.\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 8.6 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.6 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 8.6 |
