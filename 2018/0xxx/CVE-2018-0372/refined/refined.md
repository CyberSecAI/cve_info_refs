Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0372:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper memory management when DHCPv6 packets are received on an interface of the targeted Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switch in ACI mode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability lies in how the device handles DHCPv6 packets, specifically related to memory allocation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can cause the device to run low on system memory.
- This leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.
- The device might eventually reboot due to memory exhaustion.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attack over the network.
- Sending a high number of malicious DHCPv6 packets to be processed by the affected device.
- The vulnerability only applies to IPv6 protocol packets and not for IPv4 protocol packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An unauthenticated attacker with network access to the vulnerable device.
- The attacker does not need any specific privileges or credentials.
- Unicast routing must be enabled on the Bridge Domain (BD) of the vulnerable device for the exploit to work.
- DHCP and DHCP relay do not need to be configured for the vulnerability to be exploited.

**Additional Details:**
- Affected products: Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI Mode running software version 13.0(1k).
- The vulnerability can be identified by monitoring virtual memory usage of the dhcp_snoop process.  If the VSZ exceeds 3 GB, a reboot is recommended.
- Exploitation can cause the device to reload and create a core file.
- There are no known workarounds, only software updates.
- Fixed in Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI Mode version 13.0(2k) and later releases.
- The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
- The CVSS score is 8.6 (High) with vector string: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H
- Snort rules are available for detection (47272, 47273, and 31983)
