In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows.\r\n\r\nCisco Unified Contact Center Express Stored Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (Unified CCX) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored XSS attack against a user of the web-based interface of an affected application.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based interface of an affected application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.\r\n\r\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2018-0400\r\n\r\nThe Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Base score for this vulnerability is: 6.1 [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N\"]\r\n\r\nThe Cisco bug ID for this vulnerability is: CSCvg70904 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvg70904\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco Unified Contact Center Express Reflected Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified CCX could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a reflected XSS attack against a user of the web-based interface of an affected application.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based interface of an affected application.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 6.3 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 6.3 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 6.3 |

As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.

This advisory is available at the following link:  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThese vulnerabilities affect Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (Unified CCX). For information about affected software releases, consult the Cisco bug IDs at the top of this advisory.Products Confirmed Not VulnerableOnly products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * Four vulnerabilities in Cisco Unified CCX could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct XSS attacks against a user of the interface, conduct a CSRF attack, or retrieve a cleartext password.      The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another; exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit another vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.      Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows.  **Cisco Unified Contact Center Express Stored Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability** A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (Unified CCX) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored XSS attack against a user of the web-based interface of an affected application.  The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based interface of an affected application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2018-0400  The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Base score for this vulnerability is: [6.1](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)  The Cisco bug ID for this vulnerability is: [CSCvg70904](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvg70904)  **Cisco Unified Contact Center Express Reflected Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability** A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified CCX could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a reflected XSS attack against a user of the web-based interface of an affected application.  The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based interface of an affected application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.  The CVE ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2018-0401  The CVSS Base score for this vulnerability is: [6.1](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)  The Cisco bug ID for this vulnerability is: [CSCvg70967](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvg70967)  **Cisco Unified Contact Center Express Cross-Site Request Forgery Vulnerability** A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified CCX could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a CSRF attack and perform arbitrary actions on an affected application.  The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected device.
