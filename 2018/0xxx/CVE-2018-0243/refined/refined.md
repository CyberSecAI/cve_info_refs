Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-0243:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect detection of SMB2 or SMB3 files based on their total file length within the Cisco Firepower System Software's detection engine.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper input validation: The software fails to correctly determine if an SMB2/SMB3 file should be blocked based on its length.
- File Policy Bypass: The incorrect detection logic allows a crafted SMB2/SMB3 file to bypass a configured file action policy that is meant to block such files if they contain malware.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can send malicious SMB2/SMB3 files through a vulnerable device even when the device is configured to block them. This circumvents security policies designed to prevent malware.
- Potential malware infiltration if the bypassed file is indeed malware.
- The exploit allows for bypassing the intended security controls, which can result in further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote network attack.
- The attacker sends crafted SMB2 or SMB3 transfer requests through the targeted device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Unauthenticated, remote attacker.
- The attacker needs to be able to send SMB2/SMB3 traffic to a vulnerable system.
- No special privileges are required on the target system.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** Cisco Firepower System Software with file action policies configured (specifically prior to version 6.2.3).
