    "Command Injection [CWE-77]"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `/qcenter/hawkeye/v1/network_config` API endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to have a valid 'Power User' account and must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. They also need to know the admin user's password, which can be obtained through another vulnerability (CVE-2018-0706)."
