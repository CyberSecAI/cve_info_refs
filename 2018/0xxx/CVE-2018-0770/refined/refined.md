{
  "CVE-2018-0770": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the Chakra JIT compiler's 'GlobOpt::OptTagChecks' function, which does not properly consider 'IsLoopPrePass'. This allows certain code patterns to bypass a previous fix.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper handling of 'IsLoopPrePass' in JIT compiler leading to type confusion"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to a crash in the JavaScript engine.",
    "attack_vectors": "Crafted JavaScript code that exploits the JIT compiler's optimization flaw.",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to execute crafted JavaScript code within the context of a vulnerable application using the Chakra engine (e.g., Microsoft Edge). No special privileges are needed."
