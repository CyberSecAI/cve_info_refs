Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0093:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The web-based management interface is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks. This is due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before it is rendered in the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary script code in the context of the web-based management interface of the affected device.
*   An attacker can access sensitive browser-based information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker must persuade a user of the web-based management interface to click a crafted link. The crafted link would contain malicious script that, when rendered by the vulnerable application, would execute in the context of the user's browser session.
*   The attack vector is network-based (AV:N)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
*   The attacker must rely on user interaction (UI:R) to click the crafted link.
*   The attacker does not need any privileges on the system (PR:N).
*   The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the web-based management interface of the Cisco Web Security Appliance.
*   There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
*   The scope is changed (S:C) because the vulnerability allows the attacker to execute scripts within the user's browser session on a web interface provided by the affected device.
*   The CVSS score is 6.1 (Medium) with a vector string of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
