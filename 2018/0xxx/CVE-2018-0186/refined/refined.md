Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-0186:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the web-based user interface (web UI) of Cisco IOS XE Software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities (CWE-79).

**Impact of exploitation:**
An unauthenticated, remote attacker can conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web UI of the affected software. This could potentially lead to:
*   The attacker executing arbitrary scripts in the user's browser within the context of the vulnerable web application, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
*   The attacker gaining access to sensitive information, if the user has access to the application.

**Attack vectors:**
Remote, unauthenticated attacker over the network via the web UI.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to reach the web UI of the vulnerable Cisco IOS XE software.
* The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
* The attacker needs to induce the victim to interact with the malicious crafted URL/content. This is a classic XSS scenario requiring user interaction.

**Additional Details:**

*   The HTTP server feature needs to be enabled on the Cisco IOS XE device for the vulnerability to be exploitable.
*   The advisory mentions that there are no workarounds to address these vulnerabilities.
*   The advisory also lists the specific Cisco Bug IDs associated with this issue: CSCuz38591, CSCvb09530, and CSCvb10022.
