{
  "CVE-2018-0838": {
    "Root cause": "The JIT compiler uses NewScObjectNoCtor instructions to create new objects. These instructions are not checked by CheckJsArrayKills which is used to validate the array information.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Type confusion",
      "Inadequate validation of array information during object creation."
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of Service",
    "Attack vectors": "By crafting a specific sequence of JavaScript operations, an attacker can trigger the type confusion vulnerability in the Chakra JIT compiler.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to execute JavaScript code within a vulnerable environment (Microsoft Edge). The provided Proof of Concept demonstrates the specific JavaScript necessary to trigger the vulnerability."
