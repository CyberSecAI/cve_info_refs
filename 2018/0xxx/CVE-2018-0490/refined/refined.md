Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-0490:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is located within the directory authority protocol list code of the Tor software. An incorrectly formatted relay descriptor could trigger a null-pointer dereference when directory authorities tried to vote on it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Null-pointer Dereference:** The primary weakness is that the code fails to properly handle invalid or malformed relay descriptors, leading to a null pointer dereference when the directory authority attempts to process these descriptors during the voting process. This dereference results in a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a crash of the directory authorities. Repeated crashes of directory authorities would disrupt the Tor network by hindering the network's ability to function properly.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The attack involves sending a specially crafted, malformed relay descriptor to the directory authorities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to submit relay descriptors:** An attacker would need to be in a position to submit a malformed relay descriptor to the directory authorities. This could be through operating a malicious Tor relay or potentially through some other way of injecting data into the directory authority system.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability specifically affected directory authorities; Tor relays and clients were not affected.
*   The issue was tracked as TROVE-2018-001 within the Tor project.
*   The fix was included in Tor versions 0.3.2.10, 0.3.1.10 and 0.2.9.15 and later.
