Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-0227:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the incorrect verification of SSL Client Certificates during SSL VPN connection attempts on Cisco ASA and FTD devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Certificate Validation:** The system fails to properly verify the SSL client certificate presented during the authentication process, allowing connections to be established without a valid private key and certificate pair. This violates the expected behavior of client certificate authentication.
- **Bypass of Authentication:** The improper validation enables an attacker to bypass the intended SSL certificate verification steps, effectively circumventing the authentication mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** A successful exploit allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to establish an SSL VPN connection to the affected ASA or FTD device.
- **Potential Network Access:** By gaining unauthorized VPN access, an attacker could potentially gain access to the internal network behind the firewall, leading to further compromise.
- **Integrity Violation:** The attacker can modify or tamper with data or configurations within the network, thus compromising its integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Attack:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability over a network connection, making it possible to exploit remotely.
- **SSL VPN Connection:** The attacker initiates a connection to the ASA or FTD's VPN endpoint using a crafted or invalid client certificate.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Accessibility:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the affected ASA or FTD device's VPN endpoint over the network.
- **No Credentials Needed**:  The attacker does not need any legitimate usernames or passwords.
- **SSL Client Certificate**: The attacker must be able to send the ASA or FTD device a client certificate during the handshake process.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco ASA and FTD devices configured for Client Certificate Authentication.
