| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 7.5 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 7.5 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 7.5 |

"text": "A vulnerability in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Virtual Private Network (VPN) Client Certificate Authentication feature for Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to establish an SSL VPN connection and bypass certain SSL certificate verification steps.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to incorrect verification of the SSL Client Certificate. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the ASA VPN without a proper private key and certificate pair. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to establish an SSL VPN connection to the ASA when the connection should have been rejected.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180418-asa1 [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180418-asa1\"]"

"text": "This vulnerability affects Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) and Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software that is running on the following Cisco products:\r\n3000 Series Industrial Security Appliances (ISA)\r\nASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances\r\nASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls\r\nASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers\r\nAdaptive Security Virtual Appliances (ASAv)\r\nFirepower 4110 Security Appliances\r\nFirepower 9300 ASA Security Modules\r\n\r\nTo be considered vulnerable, the ASA or FTD has to be configured for Client Certificate Authentication. Administrators can check for a vulnerable configuration using the show running-config tunnel-group | include authentication | include certificate command. If either the authentication certificate or authentication multiple-certificate configuration option is present in the configuration then the device is vulnerable. The following is an example of a vulnerable configuration:\r\n\r\n\r\nasa# show running-config tunnel-group | include authentication | include certificate\r\nauthentication certificate authentication multiple-certificate\r\n Vulnerable ASA Software ASA Software is only vulnerable if running one of the following software versions:\r\n\r\nRelease 9.4\r\nASA software versions 9.4.3.1, 9.4.3.2 and 9.4.4 through 9.4.4.13\r\n\r\nRelease 9.5\r\nASA software versions 9.5.2.7, 9.5.2.8 and 9.5.3.7 through 9.5.3.9\r\n\r\nRelease 9.6\r\nASA software versions 9.6.2.9 through 9.6.2.21 and 9.6.3 through 9.6.3.17\r\nDetermining the ASA Software Release To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco ASA Software is running on a device, administrators can use the show version | include Version command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.4(4):\r\nciscoasa# show version | include Version\r\nCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.4(4)\r\nDevice Manager Version 7.4(1)\r\n Customers who use Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to manage devices can locate the software release in the table that appears in the login window or the upper-left corner of the Cisco ASDM window. Vulnerable FTD Software FTD software is only vulnerable if running one of the following software versions:\r\n\r\nRelease 6.0\r\nFTD software versions 6.0 through 6.0.1.4.\r\n\r\nRelease 6.1\r\nFTD software versions 6.1.0 through 6.1.0.5.\r\nDetermining the Running FTD Software Release Administrators can use the show versionCLI command to determine the FTD release. In this example, the device is running software release 6.1.0.\r\n> show version\r\n---------------------[ ftd ]---------------------\r\nModel : Cisco ASA5525-X Threat Defense (75) Version 6.1.0 (Build 362)\r\nUUID : 2849ba3c-ecb8-11e6-98ca-b9fc2975893c\r\nRules update version : 2017-03-15-001-vrt\r\nVDB version : 279\r\n----------------------------------------------------"

Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThis vulnerability affects Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) and Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software that is running on the following Cisco products:   + 3000 Series Industrial Security Appliances (ISA)   + ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances   + ASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls   + ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers   + Adaptive Security Virtual Appliances (ASAv)   + Firepower 4110 Security Appliances   + Firepower 9300 ASA Security Modules To be considered vulnerable, the ASA or FTD has to be configured for **Client Certificate Authentication**. Administrators can check for a vulnerable configuration using the **show running-config tunnel-group | include authentication | include certificate** command. If either the **authentication certificate** or **authentication multiple-certificate** configuration option is present in the configuration then the device is vulnerable. The following is an example of a vulnerable configuration:  ```   asa# show running-config tunnel-group | include authentication | include certificate   authentication certificate   authentication multiple-certificate   ``` Vulnerable ASA SoftwareASA Software is only vulnerable if running one of the following software versions:      **Release 9.4**   ASA software versions 9.4.3.1, 9.4.3.2 and 9.4.4 through 9.4.4.13      **Release 9.5**   ASA software versions 9.5.2.7, 9.5.2.8 and 9.5.3.7 through 9.5.3.9      **Release 9.6**   ASA software versions 9.6.2.9 through 9.6.2.21 and 9.6.3 through 9.6.3.17Determining the ASA Software ReleaseTo determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco ASA Software is running on a device, administrators can use the **show version** **| include Version** command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco ASA Software Release **9.4(4)**: ```   ciscoasa# show version | include VersionCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.4(4)Device Manager Version 7.4(1)   ``` Customers who use Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to manage devices can locate the software release in the table that appears in the login window or the upper-left corner of the Cisco ASDM window.Vulnerable FTD SoftwareFTD software is only vulnerable if running one of the following software versions:   **Release 6.0**   FTD software versions 6.0 through 6.0.1.4.      **Release 6.1**   FTD software versions 6.1.0 through 6.1.0.5.Determining the Running FTD Software ReleaseAdministrators can use the **show version**CLI command to determine the FTD release. In this example, the device is running software release **6.1.0**. ```   > show version---------------------[ ftd ]---------------------Model : Cisco ASA5525-X Threat Defense (75) Version 6.1.0 (Build 362)UUID : 2849ba3c-ecb8-11e6-98ca-b9fc2975893cRules update version : 2017-03-15-001-vrtVDB version : 279----------------------------------------------------   ``` Products Confirmed Not VulnerableCisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Firepower 2100 Series Security Appliances. No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:   [http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN\_.html](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html)  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release.
