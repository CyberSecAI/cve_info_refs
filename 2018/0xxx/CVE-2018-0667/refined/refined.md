Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2018-0667:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a DLL preloading issue present in the installer for INplc SDK Express and INplc SDK Pro+. The installer attempts to load a DLL file. If a malicious DLL with the same name is present in the same directory as the installer, it will load and execute the malicious DLL instead of the intended one.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **DLL Preloading (CWE-427):** The installer does not properly validate the source or authenticity of the DLL files it loads, making it susceptible to loading malicious DLLs placed in the same directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution with the privilege of the user who invokes the installer. This means an attacker can gain control of the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker places a malicious DLL file with the same name as the legitimate DLL expected by the installer, in the same directory as the installer.
- When the user runs the vulnerable installer, it will load the attacker's malicious DLL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have write access to the directory where the installer is run. This allows them to place the malicious DLL before the user executes the installer.
- The attacker must also know the name of the DLL that the installer attempts to load.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability only affects the installer.  Systems with the INplc software already installed are not affected.
- The solution is to use the latest version of the installer, or if using the product CD-ROM, ensure not to copy to rewriteable media.
- There is an implication that if a user runs the installer from a writeable media, they should check for suspicious files in the directory beforehand.
