Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-0875:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of an insecure hashing algorithm in .NET Core for case-insensitive string comparisons. This weakness allows an attacker to predict the hashes of strings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Hashing Algorithm:**  .NET Core used a hashing algorithm that was susceptible to collisions when handling case-insensitive strings. This was particularly exploitable when using Dictionary data structures with case-invariant keys.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could intentionally create hash collisions by crafting specific strings. When these strings are used as keys in a Dictionary, the lookup times increase dramatically, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector involves inserting crafted strings into a Dictionary or similar data structures that use case-insensitive string comparison as part of their functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to supply input that can be used as case-insensitive keys in a .NET Core application, specifically those using Dictionary structures.

**Summary of Vulnerability:**
*The core issue is a hash collision vulnerability in .NET Core's string comparison logic that could lead to a denial-of-service attack if an attacker provides carefully crafted strings.

**Additional Notes:**
* Red Hat rated this issue as having a low security impact.
* The issue was fixed in updated versions of .NET Core (1.0.10, 1.1.7, and 2.0.6).
* The vulnerability was reported by Ben Adams of Illyriad Games.
