Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-0468

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to the installation of the PostgreSQL database with unchanged default access credentials within the Cisco Energy Management Suite (CEMS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Hardcoded default credentials for the PostgreSQL database: Username: `postgres`, Password: `Pemadmin123!`
- The application stores the password in a configuration file (jemprocessor.conf) as ciphertext, but it can be decrypted using the application's secret key.
- Lack of randomized password generation during installation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can access and alter confidential data stored in the PostgreSQL database. This includes user password hashes and other application data.
- Depending on database configuration and compromised data, it could lead to further compromise of the application and/or connected systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local access:** By default, an attacker needs local access to the host where CEMS is installed to connect to the database.
- **Potential remote access (configuration-dependent):** If the PostgreSQL server is configured to allow external network connections, a remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability if they can authenticate to the machine where CEMS is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local access:** An attacker must be able to log in to the operating system of the CEMS host (for default configuration).
- **Potential network access:** If PostgreSQL server is misconfigured, an attacker with network access to the vulnerable server may be able to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Chris Lyne from Tenable.
- Cisco has released a fix in version 5.2.3 of the Energy Management Suite that randomizes the database access password for new installations, but this fix does not change passwords on existing deployments.
- Users with existing installations must manually change the database password following the instructions provided by Cisco.
- The vulnerability is classified as "Medium" severity based on CVSS v2 scoring (5.9 / 5.1) and "High" severity based on CVSS v3 scoring (7.1 and 7.8) depending on the source.
- The affected products are Cisco Energy Management versions 4.4 and 5.2.x before 5.2.3.
