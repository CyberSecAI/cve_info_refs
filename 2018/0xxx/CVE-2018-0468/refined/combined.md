# [R1] Cisco Energy Management Suite Default PostgreSQL Credentials

Medium

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Tenable has discovered that default credentials for PostgreSQL are used in Cisco Energy Management.

#### Default PostgreSQL Credentials

Default credentials are used by Cisco Energy Management to access a local PostgreSQL database. This database stores application data, including user password hashes. In order to exploit this vulnerability, [by default] an attacker must have local access to the host operating system; however, this depends on the configuration of PostgreSQL.

The default credentials for the PostgreSQL database are:

```

Username: postgres
Password: Pemadmin123!

```

The hard-coded password is checked for several times throughout the codebase. Additionally, the password is stored in jemprocessor.conf as ciphertext; however, this password may be decrypted using the application secret key.

As stated above, by default, an attacker must have local access to exploit this issue. This is due to the configuration of the PostgreSQL server. If a system administrator were to modify the configuration to allow external network connections, a remote access vector would be created.

### Solution

Upgrade to Cisco Energy Management version 5.2.3.

| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.

| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 7.1 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 7.1 |

The vulnerability is due to the installation of the PostgreSQL database with unchanged default access credentials. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the machine where CEMS is installed and establishing a local connection to the database.  The fix for this vulnerability randomizes the database access password in new installations; however, the fix will not change the password for existing installations. Users are required to manually change the password, as documented in the [Workarounds](#work) section of this advisory.  There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThis vulnerability affects Cisco Energy Management Suite (CEMS). For information about affected software releases, consult the Cisco bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory.Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Workarounds  * Users of existing installations can change the database access password by following the instructions in the [Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/web/software/285994366/144305/release_notes.html) document under the *"*Reset PostgreSQL database password*"* section.  Fixed Software  * For information about fixed software releases, consult the Cisco bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
