Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-0112

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation within Cisco WebEx clients. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize or validate Flash (.swf) files, which can lead to code execution when a malicious file is opened.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of proper input validation when handling Flash files.
*   **Remote Code Execution:**  The vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution on the user's system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can achieve remote code execution on the system of a user who opens a malicious Flash file. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **File Sharing:** The attacker leverages the file-sharing capability of the WebEx client to deliver the malicious Flash file to meeting attendees.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires the user to open the malicious .swf file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the WebEx meeting.
*   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely via WebEx meeting functionalities.
*   **File Sharing access**: The attacker needs to have the ability to share files via the Webex file sharing feature.

**Affected Products:**
*   Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS31) client builds prior to T31.23.2
*   Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS32) client builds prior to T32.10
*   Cisco WebEx Meetings with client builds prior to T32.10
*   Cisco WebEx Meetings Server builds prior to 2.8 MR2

**Mitigation:**
*   Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability.
*   Customers who cannot update should remove all WebEx software using the Meeting Services Removal Tool or the Mac WebEx Meeting Application Uninstaller
*   Note: Upon updating to the most current client build of the WebEx Suites, customers will no longer be able to share Flash (.*swf*) files by using the WebEx file-sharing feature.
