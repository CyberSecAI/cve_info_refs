Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThis vulnerability affects clients that are installed by customers when accessing a WebEx meeting. The following client builds of Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS30, WBS31, and WBS32), Cisco WebEx Meetings, and Cisco WebEx Meetings Server are impacted by the vulnerability described in this advisory:   + Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS31) client builds prior to T31.23.2   + Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS32) client builds prior to T32.10   + Cisco WebEx Meetings with client builds prior to T32.10   + Cisco WebEx Meetings Server builds prior to 2.8 MR2To determine whether a Cisco WebEx Business Suite site is running an affected version of the WebEx client build, users can log in to their Cisco WebEx meeting site and go to the **Support > Downloads** section. The version of the WebEx client build will be displayed on the right side of the page under **About Meeting Center**. See the “Fixed Software” section for details.      Alternatively, version information of the Cisco WebEx meeting client can be accessed from within the Cisco WebEx meeting client. Version information for the Cisco WebEx meeting client on Windows and Linux platforms can be viewed by choosing **Help > About Cisco WebEx Meeting Center**. Version information for the Cisco WebEx meeting client on Mac platforms can be viewed by choosing **Meeting Center > About Cisco WebEx Meeting Center**.      Cisco WebEx software updates are cumulative in client builds. For example, if client build 30.32.16 is fixed, build 30.32.17 will contain the fix. Cisco WebEx site administrators have access to secondary version nomenclature; for example, T30 SP32 EP 16, which shows that the server is running client build 30.32.16.      **Note:** Customers who do not receive automatic software updates may be running versions of Cisco WebEx that have reached end of software maintenance and should contact customer support.Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * The Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS) meeting services and Cisco WebEx Meetings are a hosted multimedia conferencing solution that is managed and maintained by Cisco WebEx. The Cisco WebEx Business Suite includes Cisco WebEx Event Center, Cisco WebEx Meeting Center, Cisco WebEx Support Center, and Cisco WebEx Training Center. The Cisco WebEx Meetings Server is a multimedia conferencing solution that customers can host in their private clouds. Customers download the WebEx client application to attend meetings on the various Cisco WebEx Centers.      Exploitation of this vulnerability may cause remote code execution to occur on the system running an affected client.      To exploit this vulnerability, the client application would require a meeting attendee to open a malicious Flash (*.swf*) file. An attacker may be able to accomplish this exploit by providing the malicious *.swf* file directly to users via the file-sharing capabilities of the client.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, it is possible to remove all WebEx software completely from a system by using the Meeting Services Removal Tool (for Microsoft Windows users) or Mac WebEx Meeting Application Uninstaller (for Apple Mac OS X users), both of which are available for download from the Cisco Collaboration Help for Cisco Spark, WebEx, and Jabber article at <https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/WBX000026396>.      Removal of the WebEx software from a Linux or UNIX-based system can be accomplished by following the steps in the Cisco Collaboration Help for Cisco Spark, WebEx, and Jabber article at <https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/WBX28548>.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:      <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.  **Customers Without Service Contracts**  Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.  **Fixed Releases**  The following client builds of Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS31 and WBS32), Cisco WebEx Meetings, and Cisco WebEx Meetings Server address the vulnerability described in this advisory:    + Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS31) client builds T31.23.2 and later   + Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS32) client builds T32.10 and later   + Cisco WebEx Meetings client builds T32.1 and later   + Cisco WebEx Meetings Server builds 2.8 MR2 and later To determine whether a Cisco WebEx meeting site is running an affected version of the WebEx client build, users can log in to their Cisco WebEx meeting site and go to the **Support > Downloads** section. The version of the WebEx client build will be displayed on the right side of the page under **About Meeting Center**. Cisco WebEx software updates are cumulative in client builds. For example, if client build 30.32.16 is fixed, build 30.32.17 will contain updated software.  **Note:** Users with Cisco WebEx Business Suites that are on lockdown will need to contact WebEx Support to apply the appropriate patch to their WebEx site.  **Note:** Upon updating to the most current client build of the WebEx Suites, customers will no longer be able to share Flash (.*swf*) files by using the WebEx file-sharing feature.  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 9.0 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 9.0 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 9.0 |
