Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0322:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a failure to enforce access restrictions on the Help Desk and User Provisioning roles within the web management interface of Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning (PCP). This lack of proper access control allows authenticated users with these lower-level roles to bypass intended restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control:** The primary weakness is the failure to adequately enforce access control mechanisms based on user roles. This allows users with lower privileges (Help Desk, User Provisioning) to access and modify data associated with accounts that should be outside their purview.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting this access control issue, an attacker can modify attributes of higher-privileged accounts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Modification:** An attacker can modify sensitive data associated with arbitrary accounts on the affected device.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain elevated privileges on the device.
- **Compromise of System:** An attacker could potentially compromise the entire system due to the elevated privileges obtained.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Access:** The attack is performed remotely through the web management interface.
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the system with either Help Desk or User Provisioning role.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the web management interface of the affected Cisco PCP device.
- **Valid User Credentials:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account with either Help Desk or User Provisioning role to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning (PCP) Releases 12.1 and prior.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning Releases 12.2 and later.
- There are no workarounds available.
- The vulnerability was found during internal security testing.
- CVSS v3 score is 8.8 with vector string `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`.
