Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-0110:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a design flaw in Cisco WebEx Meetings Server. Specifically, the system does not properly disable access to certain user accounts (remote support account) even after they have been disabled via the web application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The core issue is the failure to effectively disable access to the remote support account when requested through the web interface.
*   **Design Flaw:** The system's architecture allows disabled accounts to remain accessible through alternative access points.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain access to the remote support account despite it being disabled via the web interface.
*   **Server Modification:** With access to the support account, the attacker could potentially modify server configurations.
*   **Data Breach:** The attacker could gain access to sensitive customer data stored on the server.
*   **Compromised System:** The overall system and its confidentiality and integrity can be compromised.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Attack:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system, even with low privileges.
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the system remotely via the network.

**Additional Notes:**

*   There are no workarounds available to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability affects Cisco WebEx Meetings Server.
*   Cisco hosted WebEx services are not affected.
*   The CVSS score is 6.4 (Medium), with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N.
