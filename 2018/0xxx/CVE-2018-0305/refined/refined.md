        "Content": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Fabric Services component of Cisco FXOS Software and Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability exists because the affected software insufficiently validates Cisco Fabric Services packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted Cisco Fabric Services packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to force a NULL pointer dereference and cause a DoS condition.",
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The affected software insufficiently validates Cisco Fabric Services packets.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insufficient input validation of Cisco Fabric Services packets, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.",
        "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted Cisco Fabric Services packet to an affected device. The specific attack vector depends on the configured Cisco Fabric Services distribution type:\n\nCFSoFC: Via Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) or Fibre Channel over IP (FCIP) if FC ports are configured.\nCFSoE: From a vPC peer or an attacker with access to a vPC peer link.\nCFSoIP: From any node with IP network connectivity to the management interface of the device.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Unauthenticated, remote attacker. The attacker's position varies depending on the distribution type configured:\n\nCFSoFC: Must have access to the data plane of an FC port.\nCFSoE: Must be a vPC peer or have access to a vPC peer link.\nCFSoIP: Must have IP network connectivity to the management interface of the device."
