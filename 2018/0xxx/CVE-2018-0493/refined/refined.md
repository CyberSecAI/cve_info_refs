Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0493:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to incorrect memory management in the `remctld` and `remctl-shell` servers, specifically when handling commands configured with the `sudo` option. It is a use-after-free or double-free error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability:  Memory is freed, and then accessed again, leading to unpredictable behavior, possibly code execution.
- Double-free vulnerability: Memory is freed more than once, leading to memory corruption and crashes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution: A malicious client could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the server if the command is configured with the `sudo` option.
-  The provided context says that exploitation appears to be difficult.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network access: A client must have network access to the `remctld` server.
- Specific configuration: The client must be able to run a command that uses the `sudo` configuration option.
- Multiple executions:  The client would need to run the command using sudo multiple times in a single connection using keep-alive to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the `remctld` server.
- Ability to execute commands on the server configured with the `sudo` option.
- Ability to send multiple requests in a single connection with keep-alive enabled.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects `remctld` and not `remctl-shell`.
- The vulnerability is present in versions 3.12 and 3.13 of `remctl` but is fixed in version 3.14 and later.
- Debian stable (stretch) is affected, and the fix was provided in version 3.13-1+deb9u1. Debian unstable was fixed in 3.14-1.
- Older Debian releases are not affected.
