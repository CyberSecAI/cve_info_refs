Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0572:

**CVE-2018-0572: Restrict access permissions failure in contents management function**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how baserCMS handles access restrictions for content management. Even when access to the content list is restricted, users can bypass this restriction by directly inputting the URL of a specific content's edit page.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Insufficient Access Control:** The system does not properly enforce access restrictions on individual content edit pages.
    *   **URL Direct Access Vulnerability:** The system allows direct access to edit pages through URL manipulation, bypassing intended access controls.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker, who has a site operator privilege (but not system admin) could potentially access and view or alter restricted content. This could lead to unauthorized modification or viewing of sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network:** The attack occurs over the network, likely via HTTP/HTTPS requests.
    *   **Direct URL Manipulation:** The attacker directly inputs the URL of the target content's edit page.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have a valid login account with "site operator" privileges within baserCMS, meaning they are not an administrator.
    *   **Knowledge of Target URLs:** The attacker needs to know or guess the URLs of the restricted content's edit pages.
