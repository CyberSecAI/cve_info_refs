Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2018-0526:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how the "Message" application in Cybozu Office handles external images. When a user views a message, the application may load and display an image hosted on an external server without the user's explicit consent or knowledge.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Disclosure (CWE-200): The vulnerability allows for potential information disclosure, as the loading of external images could reveal information about the user or their network to the external server hosting the image. This is a type of information exposure, since the application does not properly control access and rendering of the external resource.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is the unintended disclosure of information. When viewing a message, the user's client may load an external image without their knowledge, potentially leaking information about the user's environment to the third-party server hosting the image.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through specially crafted messages that include links to external images. The attacker could create a message with a link to an image on a server they control. When the user views the message, the application will automatically request the image, potentially revealing information to the attacker's server.
- The attacker would need to craft an email message or message in the Cybozu "Message" application and include the external image URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any specific access to the Cybozu Office server.
- The attacker needs the ability to send messages to a target user using the Cybozu "Message" application or via email if using HTML formatted emails.
- The attacker must have control of a server hosting the image they want to load.
