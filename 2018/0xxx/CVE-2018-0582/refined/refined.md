Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-0582

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The ASUS RT-AC68U wireless LAN router contains a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This means that the router's web interface does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is the presence of an XSS flaw (CWE-79). This allows the attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web pages viewed by users of the router's web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts within the context of a user's web browser when they access the router's management interface. This could lead to various malicious activities:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing cookies or session tokens, allowing the attacker to impersonate a legitimate user.
    *   **Data Theft:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive information displayed within the router's management interface.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious sites or triggering the download of malware.
    *   **Defacement:** Changing the appearance or content of the router's web interface.
    *   **Credential Theft**: Capturing user credentials entered into the router's login page.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-Based:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network (AV:N), meaning an attacker can exploit it remotely.
*   **User Interaction Required:** Exploitation requires a user to interact with the malicious link or content (UI:R). The user has to be logged into the router's management web interface or be tricked into opening the malicious link in a browser in the same network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable router, typically being on the same network or having access through the WAN interface if exposed.
*   **No Privileges Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication to the router (PR:N), although it does require a logged in user to execute the script on their browser.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting a crafted link or malicious webpage.
*  **Low Attack Complexity**

**Affected Products:**
* ASUS RT-AC68U Firmware versions prior to 3.0.0.4.380.1031.

**Solution:**
*   The vulnerability can be mitigated by updating the firmware to version 3.0.0.4.380.1031 or later.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was reported by Yuto MAEDA of University of Tsukuba to IPA.
*   JPCERT/CC coordinated with the developer under Information Security Early Warning Partnership.
