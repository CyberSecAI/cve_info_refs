## For Those Who Want to Run Ahead

RT-AC68U supports combined dual-band data rates of up to 1900Mbps. 1300
Mbps 802.11ac at 5 GHz gives Gigabit wireless data rates, while Broadcom®
TurboQAM™ technology super-charges 2.4 GHz 802.11n performance from
450 Mbps to 600 Mbps with compatible devices.

Powered by a dual-core processor, the RT-AC68U eliminates the performance
drops that plague other routers with busy networks. So even on the busiest
home networks, HD video streaming is always smooth, the latency low for
online gaming and VoIP calls, and file downloads are never interrupted.

The RT-AC68U also features dual USB ports for file, printers and 3G/4G
modems sharing and a USB 3.0 port for up to ten times faster data transfers
than USB 2.0.

ExclusiveASUS AiCloud transforms your home networking into your personal
cloud for easy streaming and sharing to smartphones, PCs, and tablets.
Router-to-Router sync also makes it simple to sync files on USB-connected
storage with other compatible ASUS routers for hassle-free sharing of large
files with family and friends.

The easy-to-use ASUSWRT graphical user interface unlocks the power of
the RT-AC68U giving robust control to optimize your network for you. 30-second
set-up and easy traffic management means even network newbies can enjoy
its sophisticated features, while power users will love its IPv6 support,
multiple wireless SSIDs and encrypted VPN access.

### Super-fast AC Wi-Fi with TurboQAM™ Wi-Fi acceleration

Powered by 5th generation Wi-Fi (5G Wi-Fi), the new 802.11ac chipset gives
the RT-AC68U superfast Gigabit wireless speeds. What's more, RT-AC68U uses
TurboQAM™ technology to upgrade 2.4G Wi-Fi even further to give you
unprecedented speeds. At 2.4 GHz, it's 33% faster than generic wireless-N900
routers, reaching 600 Mbps, while on the 5 GHz band it blazes to 1300 Mbps
- or triple 802.11n rates. That's 1900 Mbps of concurrent wireless power!

\*To get the best performance, pair RT-AC68U with ASUS PCE-AC68 client card

### Do more at once with dual-core processors inside

The ASUS RT-AC68U features a dual-core processor that eliminates the performance
drops that plague other routers. So even on the busiest home networks,
HD video streaming is always smooth, the latency low for online gaming
and VoIP calls, and file downloads are never interrupted.
