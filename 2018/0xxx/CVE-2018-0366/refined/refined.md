- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary script code within the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious link and persuade a user of the WSA's web-based management interface to click it. The attacker does not require any authentication.
