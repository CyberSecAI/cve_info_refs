The vulnerability exists because the affected software insufficiently validates header values in Cisco Fabric Services packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted Cisco Fabric Services packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow that could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a DoS condition.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:  This advisory is part of the June 2018 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Collection, which includes 24 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 24 vulnerabilities.

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Firepower 2100 Series Firewalls   + Nexus 1000V Series Switches   + Nexus 1100 Series Cloud Services Platforms   + Nexus 3600 Platform Switches   + Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode Cisco has not investigated whether this vulnerability affects Cisco Nexus 4000 Series Switches, Cisco Nexus 5010 Switches, or Cisco Nexus 5020 Switches because those products have reached end-of-life status. For more information, refer to the [End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement for the Cisco Nexus 4000 Series Switch Modules for IBM BladeCenter](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/nexus-4000-series-switches/eos-eol-notice-c51-733205.html) and the [End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement for the Cisco Nexus 5010 and Nexus 5020 Switches](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/nexus-5000-series-switches/eol_c51-709037.html).  Details  * Cisco Fabric Services provides a common infrastructure for distributing and synchronizing configuration data between Cisco devices that are on the same network and with virtual port channels (vPCs). This includes configuration data for applications and features that are compatible with and enabled to use Cisco Fabric Services-for example, Distributed Device Alias Services, Network Time Protocol (NTP), and user and administrator roles.  To distribute and synchronize data, Cisco Fabric Services can be configured to use any of the following distribution types:    + **Cisco Fabric Services over Fibre Channel (CFSoFC)**-Distributes data over a Fibre Channel (FC), such as a virtual storage area network (VSAN). CFSoFC distribution is enabled by default.   + **Cisco Fabric Services over Ethernet (CFSoE)**-Distributes data over an Ethernet network. For vPC support, Cisco Fabric Services must be configured to use this distribution type. CFSoE distribution is disabled by default.   + **Cisco Fabric Services over IP (CFSoIP)**-Distributes data over an IPv4 or IPv6 network. CFSoIP distribution is disabled by default. The vulnerability described in this advisory is due to insufficient input validation that could occur when the affected software processes Cisco Fabric Services packets that it receives during distribution and synchronization operations. Exploitation of the vulnerability does not require any applications to be enabled to use Cisco Fabric Services. Instead, exploitation depends on which Cisco Fabric Services distribution types are configured for a device. In addition, the attack vectors vary based on which distribution types are configured, as follows:    + **CFSoFC**-An attack could occur via Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) or Fibre Channel over IP (FCIP), if FC ports are configured for a device. In this scenario, an attack could succeed in the data plane, not the management plane, of any FC port. If no FC ports are configured for a device, this distribution type cannot be used to exploit the vulnerability.   + **CFSoE**-An attack is possible from only a vPC peer or an attacker who has access to a vPC peer link. No other peer, neighbor, or network node can be used to exploit the vulnerability.   + **CFSoIP**-An attack is possible from any node that has IP network connectivity to the management interface of a device. In this scenario, an attack cannot succeed from the data plane. If a device is enabled to use more than one distribution type, the applicable attack vectors for all those distribution types exist for the device.  Administrators can display configuration information and check the distribution status of Cisco Fabric Services for a device by using the **show cfs status** command in the device CLI, as shown in the following example:  ```   switch# show cfs status   Distribution : Enabled   Distribution over IP : Disabled   IPv4 multicast address : 239.255.70.83   IPv6 multicast address : ff15::efff:4653   Distribution over Ethernet : Disabled   ```  In the preceding example, the *Enabled* value in the **Distribution** field of the command output indicates that Cisco Fabric Services is enabled for the device and the device is configured to use the default Cisco Fabric Services distribution type, which is CFSoFC. The *Disabled* value in the **Distribution over IP** field and the **Distribution over Ethernet** field indicates that the device is not additionally configured to use the CFSoIP and CFSoE distribution types.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:      <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the applicable table in this section. To help ensure a complete upgrade solution, consider that this advisory is part of a collection. For a complete list of the advisories in the collection and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: June 2018 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Collection](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-67770).

"text": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Fabric Services component of Cisco FXOS Software and Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability exists because the affected software insufficiently validates header values in Cisco Fabric Services packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted Cisco Fabric Services packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow that could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180620-fxnxos-fab-ace [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180620-fxnxos-fab-ace\"]\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the June 2018 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Collection, which includes 24 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 24 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: June 2018 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Collection [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-67770\"]."

"title": "Details",
"text": "Cisco Fabric Services provides a common infrastructure for distributing and synchronizing configuration data between Cisco devices that are on the same network and with virtual port channels (vPCs). This includes configuration data for applications and features that are compatible with and enabled to use Cisco Fabric Services���for example, Distributed Device Alias Services, Network Time Protocol (NTP), and user and administrator roles.\r\n\r\nTo distribute and synchronize data, Cisco Fabric Services can be configured to use any of the following distribution types:\r\n\r\nCisco Fabric Services over Fibre Channel (CFSoFC)���Distributes data over a Fibre Channel (FC), such as a virtual storage area network (VSAN). CFSoFC distribution is enabled by default.\r\nCisco Fabric Services over Ethernet (CFSoE)���Distributes data over an Ethernet network. For vPC support, Cisco Fabric Services must be configured to use this distribution type. CFSoE distribution is disabled by default.\r\nCisco Fabric Services over IP (CFSoIP)���Distributes data over an IPv4 or IPv6 network. CFSoIP distribution is disabled by default.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability described in this advisory is due to insufficient input validation that could occur when the affected software processes Cisco Fabric Services packets that it receives during distribution and synchronization operations. Exploitation of the vulnerability does not require any applications to be enabled to use Cisco Fabric Services. Instead, exploitation depends on which Cisco Fabric Services distribution types are configured for a device. In addition, the attack vectors vary based on which distribution types are configured, as follows:\r\n\r\nCFSoFC���An attack could occur via Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) or Fibre Channel over IP (FCIP), if FC ports are configured for a device. In this scenario, an attack could succeed in the data plane, not the management plane, of any FC port. If no FC ports are configured for a device, this distribution type cannot be used to exploit the vulnerability.\r\nCFSoE���An attack is possible from only a vPC peer or an attacker who has access to a vPC peer link. No other peer, neighbor, or network node can be used to exploit the vulnerability.\r\nCFSoIP���An attack is possible from any node that has IP network connectivity to the management interface of a device. In this scenario, an attack cannot succeed from the data plane.\r\n\r\nIf a device is enabled to use more than one distribution type, the applicable attack vectors for all those distribution types exist for the device.\r\n\r\nAdministrators can display configuration information and check the distribution status of Cisco Fabric Services for a device by using the show cfs status command in the device CLI, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nswitch# show cfs status\r\nDistribution : Enabled Distribution over IP : Disabled IPv4 multicast address : 239.255.70.83 IPv6 multicast address : ff15::efff:4653 Distribution over Ethernet : Disabled\r\n\r\nIn the preceding example, the Enabled value in the Distribution field of the command output indicates that Cisco Fabric Services is enabled for the device and the device is configured to use the default Cisco Fabric Services distribution type, which is CFSoFC. The Disabled value in the Distribution over IP field and the Distribution over Ethernet field indicates that the device is not additionally configured to use the CFSoIP and CFSoE distribution types."

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 9.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 9.8 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 9.8 |
