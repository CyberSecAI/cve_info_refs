Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-0308

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of header values in Cisco Fabric Services packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient input validation leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device.
- Denial of Service (DoS): Exploitation can also cause a denial-of-service condition, making the device unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vectors vary depending on the configured Cisco Fabric Services distribution types:
    - **CFSoFC (Cisco Fabric Services over Fibre Channel):**
      - Attack via Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) or Fibre Channel over IP (FCIP), if FC ports are configured.
      - The attack occurs in the data plane, not the management plane of any FC port.
      - If no FC ports are configured, this vector is not exploitable.
    - **CFSoE (Cisco Fabric Services over Ethernet):**
      - Attack is possible only from a vPC (virtual port channel) peer or an attacker with access to a vPC peer link.
    - **CFSoIP (Cisco Fabric Services over IP):**
      - Attack is possible from any node with IP network connectivity to the management interface.
      - This attack cannot succeed from the data plane.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to the device.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected device, which depends on the configured distribution type:
    - **CFSoFC:** Network access to the FC ports.
    - **CFSoE:** Access to a vPC peer or the vPC peer link.
    - **CFSoIP:** IP network connectivity to the management interface.
- **Crafted Packets:** The attacker must be able to send crafted Cisco Fabric Services packets to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability exists in the Cisco Fabric Services component of Cisco FXOS Software and Cisco NX-OS Software.
- The vulnerability does not require any specific application using Cisco Fabric Services to be enabled. Exploitation depends solely on which CFS distribution types are active.
- The document provides detailed instructions on how to identify if a device is configured to use Cisco Fabric Services and its distribution types via the CLI using the "show cfs status" command.
- There are no workarounds available.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
