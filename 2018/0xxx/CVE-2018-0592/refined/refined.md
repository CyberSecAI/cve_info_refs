Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0592:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is insecure loading of Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs), specifically "Application Directory (App Dir) DLL planting." This occurs because the affected applications and installers do not properly validate the location from which they load DLLs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CWE-427:** Uncontrolled Search Path Element - The applications and installers search for DLLs in the same directory where they reside, in addition to system directories, without proper validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** If a malicious DLL file is placed in the same directory as the vulnerable application or installer, it will be loaded and executed with the privileges of the user who runs the application or installer. This allows an attacker to gain control of the system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local:** An attacker needs to place a malicious DLL file in the same directory as the vulnerable application or installer. This can occur if an attacker has write access to the directory, or if a user is tricked into putting the malicious DLL there.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must execute the vulnerable application or installer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Write access or user interaction:** An attacker needs to either have write access to the directory where the application or installer resides or convince a user to place a malicious DLL there.
*   **Malicious DLL creation:** The attacker needs to create a DLL file crafted to execute the desired malicious code.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in multiple Microsoft Windows applications and installers, including Microsoft OneDrive, Skype for Windows, and the installers for Visual Studio Community and Visual Studio Code.
*   Microsoft considers this a low-impact issue and has stated they do not plan to release security updates to address the vulnerability.
*   Workarounds include ensuring that system directories are write-protected, using standard user accounts for daily tasks, and making sure that installers and applications are invoked from safe directories without unrelated files.
*   The provided content includes CVSS v3 and v2 scores and vectors.
