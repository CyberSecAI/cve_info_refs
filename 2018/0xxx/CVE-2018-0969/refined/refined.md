The provided content is related to CVE-2018-0969.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `nt!NtQueryAttributesFile` system call. When invoked with specific paths of certain kernel objects, the `FileAttributes` field within the returned `FILE_BASIC_INFORMATION` structure is not initialized.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Kernel stack memory disclosure: The 4-byte `FileAttributes` field is uninitialized and contains arbitrary stack data, leading to a kernel stack memory disclosure to user-mode.
- Lack of initialization: The kernel does not properly initialize the `FileAttributes` field when processing specific paths.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker can read uninitialized kernel stack memory, potentially leaking sensitive information, such as addresses that can be used to defeat ASLR or other secrets.
- Potential for further exploits: By obtaining kernel memory content, an attacker might be able to find valuable information for further exploitation of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: The attacker needs to execute code locally on the target system.
- Specific paths: The vulnerability is triggered by calling `nt!NtQueryAttributesFile` with specific object paths. The article lists several paths that trigger the leak on Windows 10, such as:
    - `\ArcName\multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)`
    - `\GLOBAL??\Harddisk0Partition1`
    - `\GLOBAL??\Volume{GUID}`
    - `\GLOBAL??\SystemPartition`
    - `\GLOBAL??\STORAGE#Volume#{GUID}#0000000000100000#{GUID}`
    - `\GLOBAL??\HarddiskVolume1`
    - `\Device\SystemPartition`
    - `\Device\HarddiskVolume1`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local user access: The attacker must be able to execute code on the target system.
- No elevated privileges are explicitly mentioned.

**Additional Details:**
- The content provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) code, along with details on how to reproduce the vulnerability and observe the memory leak.
- The PoC code includes a function called `SprayKernelStack`, which fills the kernel stack with marker bytes (0x41). This allows the leaked stack data to be more easily observed.
- The vulnerable operating systems include Windows 7 to 10, both 32 and 64 bit.
