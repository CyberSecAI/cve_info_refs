  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A new symlink feature in NPFS (Named Pipe File System) introduced in Windows 10 1709 allows creation of symlinks by low-privileged users, and these symlinks are handled differently from other Windows symlinks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Creation of NPFS symlinks is not restricted to privileged users, allowing low IL or normal users to create them.",
      "Accessing an NPFS symlink results in the NPFS driver creating an NTFS symlink reparse point, allowing the symlink to redirect to different devices, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.",
       "Opening an NPFS symlink does not respect the FILE_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT flag, which could lead to unusual behavior."
    ],
    "impact": "Elevation of privilege (EoP) by redirecting privileged operations on named pipes to other files. For example, a privileged caller expecting to write to a named pipe could unknowingly write data to a file, potentially leading to EoP.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local exploitation by creating malicious NPFS symlinks with low privileges.",
    "required_capabilities": "Low IL or normal user privileges on Windows 10 1709 or later. The attacker needs to be able to open the root named pipe device (\\Device\\NamedPipe)."
