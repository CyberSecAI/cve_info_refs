Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-0953

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a type confusion issue within the Microsoft Edge Chakra JavaScript engine's JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler. Specifically, the `JavascriptNativeFloatArray::SetItem` function can convert a float array to a var array if a specific double value (referred to as the "magic value") is provided. The JIT-compiled code does not properly check this input value, allowing for type confusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Type confusion: The JIT-compiled code does not validate the input double value against the magic value before using the array.
- Inadequate type checking: The lack of proper validation of the input leads to the wrong code being executed, resulting in a type confusion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The provided exploit code triggers the type confusion, leading to a crash and denial of service. The provided exploit is specifically classified as a DoS type exploit.

**Attack Vectors:**
- JavaScript execution: The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a specific JavaScript code that provides a "magic value" to `JavascriptNativeFloatArray::SetItem` during array manipulation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code within a context using the vulnerable Microsoft Edge browser with the vulnerable Chakra engine.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability lies in how the Chakra engine's JIT compiler optimizes array writes. When the specific double value (``-5.3049894784e-314``) is used to write to an element of float array, the engine converts float array to `var array`, since that magic number is equal to the missing item value. However, the JIT-compiled version of the `SetItem` function doesn't check for this condition. This mismatch in the type of the array being used results in a type confusion that leads to a crash.
