Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0584:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an authentication bypass issue in the IIJ SmartKey App for Android.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-287: Improper Authentication:** The application fails to properly validate the user's identity, allowing an attacker to potentially bypass the authentication mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can potentially obtain one-time passwords generated by the application. This can be used to bypass two-factor authentication on systems protected by IIJ SmartKey App.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access (CVSS v3):** The vulnerability can be exploited locally, meaning the attacker needs some form of access to the device on which the vulnerable app is installed.
*   **Network Access (CVSS v2):** The CVSS v2 score indicates a network attack vector but with high complexity. 
    
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **CVSS v3:** The attacker requires physical access to the device, low complexity, and no special privileges. User interaction is required, suggesting the user might need to be tricked into doing something.
*   **CVSS v2:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability from a network position, but high attack complexity is required, and no authentication is needed.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects IIJ SmartKey App for Android version 2.1.0 and earlier.
*   The vendor recommends updating to version 2.1.1 or later.
*   A workaround is to use the Android OS standard screen lock, which mitigates the risk.

**Summary:**

This CVE describes an authentication bypass vulnerability in the IIJ SmartKey App for Android. The vulnerability allows an attacker to obtain one-time passwords, potentially leading to unauthorized access to accounts protected by two-factor authentication. The attack can be performed locally with some user interaction and low complexity, while the CVSS v2 score suggest that it might also be performed remotely under a high complexity. The official recommendation is to update to the latest version of the app.
