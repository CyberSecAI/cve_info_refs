{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The nt!NtQueryInformationTransactionManager system call, when invoked with the TransactionManagerRecoveryInformation (4) information class, discloses uninitialized kernel pool memory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Kernel pool memory disclosure",
      "Use of uninitialized memory"
    ],
    "impact": "Local authenticated attackers could potentially defeat exploit mitigations like kernel ASLR, and read other secrets stored in the kernel address space by repeatedly triggering the vulnerability.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access",
      "System call exploitation"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be local and authenticated. They need the ability to execute code on the vulnerable machine and call the vulnerable system call `nt!NtQueryInformationTransactionManager`."
