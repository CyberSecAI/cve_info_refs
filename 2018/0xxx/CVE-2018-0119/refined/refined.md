Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0119:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper display of user account tokens generated within the Cisco Spark system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Authentication Control:** The core issue is a flaw in the authentication controls within the account services of Cisco Spark, specifically how user account tokens are handled.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  The improper handling of tokens can lead to unintended information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker, through exploiting the vulnerability, can interact with and view information on an affected device that they should normally be prohibited from accessing.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** Successful exploitation can cause a partial impact on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Attack:** The attack is carried out remotely over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the Cisco Spark system.
*   **Access to User Account Tokens:** The attacker needs to gain access to a valid token that is in use by another account.

**Summary of CVE-2018-0119**

The vulnerability lies in how Cisco Spark handles user account tokens. An authenticated remote attacker could potentially gain access to another user's token, allowing them to interact with and view information on an affected device that they normally wouldn't be able to, leading to partial compromise of confidentiality, integrity and availability.
