Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The installer for "FLET'S VIRUS CLEAR Easy Setup & Application Tool" and "FLET'S VIRUS CLEAR v6 Easy Setup & Application Tool" has a flaw in how it searches for DLL files. This is described as an issue with the DLL search path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure DLL Loading (CWE-427):** The installer does not properly validate the location of DLL files it loads. This allows an attacker to place a malicious DLL in a location where the installer will find it first, instead of the legitimate DLL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  By exploiting the DLL search path vulnerability, an attacker can cause the installer to load and execute a malicious DLL. This will result in arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user who ran the installer.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attacker needs to have access to the local system where the installer is executed.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The user must run the vulnerable installer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to place a malicious DLL file in a location where the installer will search for it before the legitimate DLL, typically within the user's environment.
*   The attacker must trick the user into running the vulnerable installer.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability exists within the installer itself. Once the application is installed, the vulnerability is not present.
* The fix is to use the latest installer version which is version 13.1 and was released on 2018-05-29
