Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-0508:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `epg search result viewer(kkcald)` application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS, meaning it doesn't properly sanitize user inputs, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts in the web browser of a logged-in user. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Stealing user credentials
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Defacement of the web application
    *   Other malicious actions within the context of the user's browser

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based (`AV:N`), meaning a remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability through the network.
*   The vulnerability requires user interaction (`UI:R`), as the victim user must visit a malicious page or interact with the injected malicious content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need any privileges on the vulnerable system (`PR:N`).
*   The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script into the application via user input.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerable product is `epg search result viewer (kkcald)` version 0.7.21 and earlier.
* The vulnerability is classified as a reflected XSS because it requires user interaction.
* The provided CVSS scores indicate a medium severity vulnerability.
* The vendor, kkcal, has been notified and the information is available on their website.
