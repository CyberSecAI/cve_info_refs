      "information": "This document provides extensive technical details regarding CVE-2018-0709. \n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to unsanitized input being passed to the operating system during date configuration updates. Specifically, a `passwd` field within a JSON request is used directly in a bash echo command without proper sanitization.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command Injection (CWE-77). The application does not sanitize the `passwd` parameter when updating the date configuration, allowing for arbitrary command execution.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system, leading to full system compromise.\n\n**Attack vectors:** A malicious user can send a crafted POST request to the `/qcenter/hawkeye/v1/date_config` endpoint, injecting malicious code into the `passwd` parameter.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n*   The attacker needs to be authenticated as a 'Power User'.\n*   The attacker needs network access to the Qâ€™center Virtual Appliance web interface."
