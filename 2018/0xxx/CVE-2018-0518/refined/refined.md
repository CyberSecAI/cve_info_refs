Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly verify SSL server certificates within the LINE for iOS application. This is due to a flaw in a third-party SDK that was incorporated into the app.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient SSL Certificate Validation:** The core issue is the lack of proper validation of SSL server certificates, making the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Eavesdropping:** A successful MITM attack could allow an attacker to intercept and eavesdrop on encrypted communication between the LINE app and its servers. This could potentially expose sensitive data being transmitted.
- **Data Tampering:** In addition to eavesdropping, attackers could also manipulate the data being transmitted, potentially altering information sent to or received from the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** The primary attack vector involves a MITM attack. This commonly occurs on untrusted networks, such as malicious Wi-Fi access points controlled by the attacker.
- **Network Based:** The attack occurs over a network connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be positioned on the network path between the user's device and the LINE servers.
- **Malicious Access Point:** The attacker typically needs to operate a rogue Wi-Fi access point or have compromised network infrastructure to perform the MITM attack.
- **High Complexity:** The attack complexity is considered high.

**Affected Versions:**
- LINE for iOS versions 7.1.3 to 7.15 are affected.
- Versions before 7.1.3 and after 7.16 are not affected.

**Unaffected Features:**
- Text messages, LINE login credentials (passwords), free voice calls, and free video calls within the LINE app are not affected by this specific vulnerability.

**Mitigation:**
- Update to LINE for iOS version 7.16 or later.
