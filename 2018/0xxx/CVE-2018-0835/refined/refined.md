Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a type confusion issue in the Microsoft Edge Chakra JavaScript engine's JIT compiler, specifically when using `Array.prototype.reverse`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Type Confusion:** The vulnerability is a type confusion, where the engine incorrectly handles the data type of an array. The `Array.prototype.reverse` function can be inlined, and this might invoke `EnsureNonNativeArray` to convert the prototype of "this" to a Var array. The prototype is meant to be a native array, but this conversion to a Var array prevents that.
- **Bypass:** The provided exploit uses `Array.prototype.sort` to bypass the prototype conversion by manipulating the prototype within the compare function. This allows creation of an object whose prototype is a native array.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided exploit demonstrates a crash of the JavaScript engine.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **JavaScript Code Execution:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafted JavaScript code executed within Microsoft Edge.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Execute JavaScript:** An attacker needs to be able to execute malicious JavaScript code within the Microsoft Edge browser, either via a compromised website or some other method that can execute JavaScript within the browser context.
- **No specific privilege required**: The vulnerability is exploitable without requiring specific user privileges.

**Additional Notes:**

- The exploit leverages the JIT compiler's inlining of `Array.prototype.reverse` and the behavior of `Array.prototype.sort` to manipulate object prototypes and trigger the type confusion.
- The provided code is similar to a previous issue (1457).
- The exploit uses `arr.__proto__ = null` to avoid inline caching and `delete arr[1]` to avoid `doArrayMissingValueCheckHoist`.
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) code effectively crashes the browser.
