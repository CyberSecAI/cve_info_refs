Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0600:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The installer for PlayMemories Home for Windows has an issue related to the DLL search path. This allows it to load Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) insecurely.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure DLL loading:** The installer does not properly validate the location from which it loads DLLs, making it vulnerable to DLL hijacking. This is due to the usage of an insecure DLL search path (CWE-427).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user who runs the installer. This could lead to complete compromise of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited by placing a malicious DLL in the same directory as the installer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to place a malicious DLL in the same directory as the installer before the user executes it.
- **User interaction:** The user must execute the installer to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Social engineering:** The attacker must trick the user into placing the malicious DLL into the appropriate folder.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the installation process and not after the software is installed.
- A workaround is provided where users should check for suspicious files in the directory where the installer is before running it.
- The vulnerability is described as a "DLL hijacking" vulnerability
