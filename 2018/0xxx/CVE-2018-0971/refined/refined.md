Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0971:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `nt!NtQuerySystemInformation` system call, specifically when invoked with the `SystemPageFileInformation` (0x12) and `SystemPageFileInformationEx` (0x90) information classes.
- The kernel discloses uninitialized stack memory to user-mode clients.
- The output structure contains a nested `UNICODE_STRING` structure.
- On x64 builds, padding bytes are introduced between `MaximumLength` and `Buffer` fields within the `UNICODE_STRING` structure to achieve 8-byte alignment of the `Buffer` pointer.
- These padding bytes are not initialized in the kernel's local copy of the structure and are returned to the user-mode caller in their uninitialized state.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Uninitialized kernel stack memory is exposed to user-mode processes.
- **Lack of Initialization:** The kernel fails to properly initialize padding bytes within the `UNICODE_STRING` structure before returning them to user mode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR) bypass:** By repeatedly triggering the vulnerability and analyzing the disclosed stack data, attackers can gain insight into the kernel's memory layout.
- **Information Leakage:** Attackers can potentially read other secrets or sensitive data present on the kernel stack by repeatedly triggering this vulnerability.
- This could be used to facilitate other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local, authenticated access is needed to call `nt!NtQuerySystemInformation`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers must be able to execute code with the privileges required to make the vulnerable system call.
- The vulnerability is exploitable locally on the target system.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects 64-bit versions of Windows 7 to 10.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit is provided, which sprays the kernel stack with a marker byte ('A') to demonstrate the memory disclosure.
- The PoC successfully retrieves the uninitialized bytes at offsets 0x14-0x17 of the structure
