Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper error handling within the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Engine of Cisco Firepower System Software while processing SSL traffic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Error Handling:** The SSL Engine does not handle errors correctly when processing SSL traffic.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary vulnerability is the potential for a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **High CPU Utilization:** A successful exploit could cause a persistent high CPU utilization condition on the vulnerable device, degrading its performance.
*   **Denial of Service:** The high CPU usage can lead to a denial of service, making the device unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** The attacker can be remote, not requiring local access to the system.
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploited over a network connection.
*   **Crafted SSL Traffic:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending a large volume of specifically crafted SSL traffic to the target device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Remote Access:** The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable device to send the crafted SSL traffic.
*   **Ability to Generate Traffic:** The attacker must have the capacity to generate and send a substantial volume of crafted SSL packets.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
*   There were no public announcements or known malicious exploitation of this vulnerability when the advisory was released.
*   The advisory provides workarounds to mitigate the issue by disabling specific features.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-399 (Resource Management Errors).
*   CVSS score is 5.9 (Medium severity) with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H.
