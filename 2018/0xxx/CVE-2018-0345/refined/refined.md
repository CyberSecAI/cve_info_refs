Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0345:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient validation of command arguments passed to the configuration and management database of the Cisco SD-WAN Solution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper input sanitization when processing commands sent to the configuration database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the `vmanage` user within the affected system. This could lead to a compromise of the configuration management system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is remote and requires an authenticated attacker. This indicates a network-based attack where a legitimate user or a compromised account is used to send malicious commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the Cisco SD-WAN solution. This implies they must have valid credentials.
- The attacker can be remote, suggesting the vulnerability can be exploited from anywhere on the network where the affected system is accessible.
- The attacker needs to create custom functions that contain malicious code which will be executed by the system.

**Summary of the vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a remote code execution vulnerability due to insufficient command argument validation. An authenticated attacker can exploit this by creating and executing malicious custom functions. If successful, the attacker can execute arbitrary commands with `vmanage` privileges leading to the compromise of the configuration management system.
