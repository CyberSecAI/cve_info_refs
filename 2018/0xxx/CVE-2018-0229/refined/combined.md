| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 6.5 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 6.5 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 6.5 |

"text": "A vulnerability in the implementation of Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication for Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Desktop Platforms, Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software, and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to establish an authenticated AnyConnect session through an affected device running ASA or FTD Software. The authentication would need to be done by an unsuspecting third party.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability exists because there is no mechanism for the ASA or FTD Software to detect that the authentication request originates from the AnyConnect client directly. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link and authenticating using the company's Identity Provider (IdP). A successful exploit could allow the attacker to hijack a valid authentication token and use that to establish an authenticated AnyConnect session through an affected device running ASA or FTD Software.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n"

"title": "Details",
"text": "The vulnerability described in this advisory originates from the dilemma that the head-end device that has the SAML 2.0-based SSO for AnyConnect feature enabled has no way to verify that the authentication request came from the same machine that is running the AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client.\r\n\r\nThe fix for this vulnerability involves changes in both the head-end device's ASA software and the client-side's AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client. This includes embedded browser functionality in the AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client. For a complete fix, both the head-end device and the AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client must be upgraded.\r\n\r\nAs the fix for this vulnerability requires protocol adjustments, the ASA has no automatic backward compatibility between the behavior of a solution running software versions prior to the fix and the default behavior of solutions running software versions that do include the fix.\r\n\r\nFor a transition period, both the AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client and ASA Software will support both methods. The AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client will automatically detect the correct behavior when talking to a head-end device. On the ASA side, the previous behavior will be disabled by default. The previous behavior can be enabled manually per Connection Profile (\"tunnel-group\") using the newly introduced saml external-browser command under webvpn-attributes.\r\n\r\nWhen upgrading an ASA that has the SAML 2.0-based SSO for AnyConnect feature enabled, the new behavior will be enforced after the upgrade. Customers who cannot upgrade their AnyConnect clients at the same time will need to re-enable the previous behavior manually by adding the saml external-browser command after the ASA upgrade has completed. Cisco recommends removing the saml external-browser command after all AnyConnect clients have been migrated.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the Important Notes section in the Release Notes for the Cisco ASA Series, 9.9(x) [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa99/release/notes/asarn99.html#reference\_wpd\_32d\_ybb\"], the About SSO and SAML 2.0 section in the Cisco ASA Series VPN CLI Configuration Guide, 9.9 [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa99/configuration/vpn/asa-99-vpn-config/webvpn-configure-users.html#concept\_E4852D9DE2B44A469C4D9C31444BFB62\"], the AnyConnect 4.6.00362 New Features section in the Release Notes for Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client, Release 4.6, [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/vpn\_client/anyconnect/anyconnect46/release/notes/b\_Release\_Notes\_AnyConnect\_4\_6.html#reference\_iwz\_3kr\_ycb\"] and the VPN Authentication Using SAML section in the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client Administrator Guide, Release 4.6 [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/vpn\_client/anyconnect/anyconnect46/administration/guide/b\_AnyConnect\_Administrator\_Guide\_4-6/configure-vpn.html#reference\_FE50F6515F3F41F085C733AF39C83275\"] for further information on the changed behavior."

The authentication would need to be done by an unsuspecting third party.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThis vulnerability affects the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client, and ASA Software and FTD Software configured for **SAML 2.0-based SSO** for **AnyConnect Remote Access VPN** that is running on the following Cisco products:   + 3000 Series Industrial Security Appliances (ISA)   + ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances   + ASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls   + ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers   + Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv)   + Firepower 2100 Series Security Appliance   + Firepower 4100 Series Security Appliance   + Firepower 9300 ASA Security Module   + FTD Virtual (FTDv) **ASA Software**  The ASA Software is only vulnerable if running software version 9.7.1 or later.Determining the Cisco ASA Software ReleaseTo determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco ASA Software is running on a device, administrators can use the **show version** command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco ASA Software Release **9.7(1)4**: ```   ciscoasa# show version | include Version   Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.7(1)4   Firepower Extensible Operating System Version 2.1(1.66)   Baseboard Management Controller (revision 0x1) Firmware Version: 2.4   ``` Customers who use Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to manage devices can locate the software release in the table that appears in the login window or the upper-left corner of the Cisco ASDM window.  **FTD Software**  The FTD Software is only vulnerable if running software version 6.2.1 or later.Determining the Cisco FTD Software Release To determine which Cisco FTD Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device and use the **show version** command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco FTD Software Release 6.2.2:  ```   > show version      ------------------[ ftd ]-----------------------Model : Cisco Firepower 2130 Threat Defense (77) Version 6.2.2 (Build 81)UUID : 0cd3595a-7efa-11e7-aaa1-ee3989c8bf25Rules update version : 2017-12-20-001-vrtVDB version : 290----------------------------------------------------   ```  **AnyConnect Software**  The AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client Software is only vulnerable if running software version 4.4.00243 or later.  **ASA and FTD Features**  The ASA software and the FTD software are vulnerable only if all of the following features are configured:    1. SAML 2.0 Identity Provider (IdP)   2. SAML 2.0 Service Provider (SP)   3. AnyConnect Remote Access VPN **Note:** SAML 2.0 for AnyConnect features are first supported as of ASA release 9.7.1, FTD release 6.2.1, and AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client release 4.4.00243.     To determine whether ASA or FTD is configured with a SAML 2.0 IdP, administrators can use the **show webvpn saml idp** CLI command. The following output shows an ASA configured with a SAML 2.0 IdP:  ```   ciscoasa# show webvpn saml idp saml idp my_domain_idp  url sign-in https://asa-dev.my.domain.com/idp/endpoint/HttpRedirect  url sign-out https://asa-dev.my.domain.com/idp/endpoint/HttpRedirect  trustpoint idp my_domain_trustpoint  trustpoint sp asa_trustpoint   ```  To determine whether ASA or FTD is configured as SAML 2.0 SP, administrators can use the **show running-config tunnel-group | include remote-access|webvpn-attributes|saml** CLI command. The following output shows an ASA configured as SAML 2.0 SP:  ```   ciscoasa# show running-config tunnel-group | include remote-access|webvpn-attributes|samltunnel-group cloud_idp_onelogin type remote-accesstunnel-group cloud_idp_onelogin webvpn-attributes authentication saml saml identity-provider my_domain_idp   ```  To determine whether ASA or FTD is configured for AnyConnect Remote Access VPN, administrators can use the **show running-config** CLI command and consult the following table for vulnerable configurations.       | Feature | Vulnerable Configuration |   | --- | --- |   | AnyConnect IKEv2 Remote Access (with client services) | crypto ikev2 enable  client-services port  webvpn anyconnect enable |   | AnyConnect IKEv2 Remote Access (without client services) | crypto ikev2 enable  webvpn anyconnect enable |   | AnyConnect SSL VPN | webvpn enable |      Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * The vulnerability described in this advisory originates from the dilemma that the head-end device that has the SAML 2.0-based SSO for AnyConnect feature enabled has no way to verify that the authentication request came from the same machine that is running the AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client.      The fix for this vulnerability involves changes in both the head-end device's ASA software and the client-side's AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client. This includes embedded browser functionality in the AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client. For a complete fix, both the head-end device and the AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client must be upgraded.      As the fix for this vulnerability requires protocol adjustments, the ASA has no automatic backward compatibility between the behavior of a solution running software versions prior to the fix and the default behavior of solutions running software versions that do include the fix.      For a transition period, both the AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client and ASA Software will support both methods. The AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client will automatically detect the correct behavior when talking to a head-end device. On the ASA side, the previous behavior will be disabled by default. The previous behavior can be enabled manually per Connection Profile ("**tunnel-group**") using the newly introduced **saml external-browser** command under **webvpn-attributes**.      When upgrading an ASA that has the SAML 2.0-based SSO for AnyConnect feature enabled, the new behavior will be enforced after the upgrade. Customers who cannot upgrade their AnyConnect clients at the same time will need to re-enable the previous behavior manually by adding the **saml external-browser** command after the ASA upgrade has completed. Cisco recommends removing the **saml external-browser** command after all AnyConnect clients have been migrated.  Please refer to the **Important Notes** section in the [Release Notes for the Cisco ASA Series, 9.9(x)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa99/release/notes/asarn99.html#reference_wpd_32d_ybb), the **About SSO and SAML 2.0** section in the [Cisco ASA Series VPN CLI Configuration Guide, 9.9](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa99/configuration/vpn/asa-99-vpn-config/webvpn-configure-users.html#concept_E4852D9DE2B44A469C4D9C31444BFB62), the **AnyConnect 4.6.00362 New Features** section in the [Release Notes for Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client, Release 4.6,](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/vpn_client/anyconnect/anyconnect46/release/notes/b_Release_Notes_AnyConnect_4_6.html#reference_iwz_3kr_ycb) and the **VPN Authentication Using SAML** section in the [Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client Administrator Guide, Release 4.6](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/vpn_client/anyconnect/anyconnect46/administration/guide/b_AnyConnect_Administrator_Guide_4-6/configure-vpn.html#reference_FE50F6515F3F41F085C733AF39C83275) for further information on the changed behavior.
