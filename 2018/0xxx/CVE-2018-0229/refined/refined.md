Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0229:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of a mechanism within Cisco ASA and FTD software to verify that SAML authentication requests originate from the same machine running the AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client. This absence of verification allows an attacker to potentially hijack a valid authentication token.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Session Fixation:** The core vulnerability is a session fixation issue. The ASA/FTD device cannot confirm if the authentication request comes directly from the AnyConnect client.
*   **Lack of Origin Verification:** The primary weakness is that the ASA/FTD software does not validate the source of the SAML authentication request, making it vulnerable to relay attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** A successful exploit allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to establish an authenticated AnyConnect session through a vulnerable ASA or FTD device.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The attacker can potentially hijack a valid authentication token by tricking a user to authenticate via a crafted link.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to persuade a user to click a crafted link and authenticate through the company's Identity Provider (IdP).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to reach the vulnerable ASA or FTD device.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs social engineering skills to trick a user into clicking a malicious link and authenticate through the IdP.
*   **No Prior Authentication Required:** The attacker doesn't need any prior authentication or credentials to start the attack, they leverage a valid user's authentication to gain access.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client (4.4.00243 or later), Cisco ASA Software (9.7.1 or later) and Cisco FTD Software (6.2.1 or later) are affected when configured for SAML 2.0-based SSO for AnyConnect Remote Access VPN.
*   **Mitigation:** The fix requires updates to both the ASA/FTD software and the AnyConnect client, including implementing embedded browser functionality in the client to ensure the authentication request is coming from the correct device.
*   **Backward Compatibility:** The fix introduces protocol changes, leading to potential compatibility issues with older AnyConnect clients. The ASA software includes a temporary setting to revert to the older behavior to allow for phased client upgrades.
*   **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds that fully address this vulnerability. Upgrading to the patched versions is required for full mitigation.
