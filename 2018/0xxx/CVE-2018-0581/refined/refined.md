**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need any privileges (PR:N)
*   The attacker needs to induce a user to interact with the malicious script (UI:R).

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is rated as medium severity in both CVSS v3 (6.1) and v2 (4.3).
*   The vulnerability affects RT-AC87U firmware versions prior to 3.0.0.4.378.9383
