  "CVE-2018-0175": {
    "Description": "A format string vulnerability in the LLDP subsystem of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an adjacent, unauthenticated attacker to cause a DoS condition or execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.",
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of certain fields in an LLDP message.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Use of Externally-Controlled Format String (CWE-134)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could cause a DoS condition or gain the ability to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.",
     "Attack vectors": [
        "Adjacent network"
      ],
    "Attacker capabilities": [
        "Adjacent, unauthenticated attacker",
         "Must convince an authenticated user to execute a specific 'show' command in the CLI of the affected device."
      ],
    "Additional Details": "The vulnerability is due to improper handling of certain fields in an LLDP message. An attacker who is connected directly to an interface of an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by submitting an LLDP PDU that is designed to prime the device for exploitation. An attacker must then convince an authenticated user to execute a specific show command in the CLI of the affected device."
