Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-0349:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper input validation of the `request admin-tech` command within the CLI of the affected Cisco SD-WAN Solution software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core issue is a lack of proper sanitization or validation of user input passed to the `request admin-tech` command. This allows an attacker to manipulate the command and its arguments.
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-78, which refers to "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')."

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the underlying operating system of the affected device.
- Successful exploitation can lead to privilege escalation to the `root` user.
- The vulnerability impacts the availability of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (`AV:N`).
- The attack complexity is low (`AC:L`).
- No user interaction is required (`UI:N`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated (`PR:N`).
- The attacker must be able to access the CLI of the affected device remotely.
- The attacker must modify the `request admin-tech` command.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple Cisco SD-WAN products if they are running a release prior to 18.3.0. These products include vBond Orchestrator Software, vEdge Routers (100, 1000, 2000, and 5000 series), vEdge Cloud Router Platform, vManage Network Management Software, and vSmart Controller Software.
- There are no known workarounds.
- The vulnerability was found during internal security testing.
- Cisco released software updates (version 18.3.0 of the Cisco SD-WAN Solution) to address the vulnerability.

**CVSS Score:**
- The base CVSS v3 score is 8.6, with a vector string of `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H`.
- This translates to:
  - Network Attack Vector (AV:N)
  - Low Attack Complexity (AC:L)
  - No Privileges Required (PR:N)
  - No User Interaction (UI:N)
  - Scope Changed (S:C)
  - No Confidentiality Impact (C:N)
  - No Integrity Impact (I:N)
  - High Availability Impact (A:H)
