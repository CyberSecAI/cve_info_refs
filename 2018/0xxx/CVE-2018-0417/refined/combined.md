| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 7.5 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 7.5 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 7.5 |

"text": "A vulnerability in TACACS authentication with Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform certain operations within the GUI that are not normally available to that user on the CLI.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to incorrect parsing of a specific TACACS attribute received in the TACACS response from the remote TACACS server. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating via TACACS to the GUI on the affected device. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to create local user accounts with administrative privileges on an affected WLC and execute other commands that are not allowed from the CLI and should be prohibited.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n This advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181017-wlc-gui-privesc [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181017-wlc-gui-privesc\"]"

If TACACS authorization is not configured, the WLC is not vulnerable.\r\n Determine If TACACS Authorization Is Configured\r\nIf the show tacacs-server feature is not available, this indicates that the TACACS feature (feature tacacs) is not enabled and the device is not affected by this vulnerability. The following example displays the output an administrator may use to verify if the device is vulnerable.\r\n\r\nIf no output is shown under the tables after issuing the command show tacas summary, the device is not running the TACACS service and is not vulnerable. The following output shows an example of output from a vulnerable device running the TACACS service.\r\n\r\n\r\n(wlc) >show tacacs summary\r\nAuthentication Servers Idx Server Address Port State Tout --- ---------------- ------ -------- ---- 1 10.1.1.12 49 Enabled 2 Authorization Servers Idx Server Address Port State Tout --- ---------------- ------ -------- ---- 1 10.1.1.12 49 Enabled 2 Accounting Servers Idx Server Address Port State Tout --- ---------------- ------ -------- ---- 1 10.1.1.12 49 Enabled 2\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco WLC Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fixed\"] section of this advisory.\r\n Determining the Cisco WLC Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco WLC Software release is running on a device, administrators can use the controller’s web interface or the CLI.\r\n\r\nTo use the web interface, do the following:\r\n\r\nBy using a browser, log in to the controller’s web interface\r\nClick the Monitor tab\r\nClick Summary in the left pane\r\nUnder Controller Summary, the Software Version field shows the release number of the software that is currently running on the device\r\n\r\nTo use the CLI, log in to the controller via Telnet, issue the show sysinfo command, and then refer to the value in the Product Version field of the command output. The following example shows the command output for a device that is running Cisco WLC Software Release 8.3.102.0:\r\n\r\n\r\n(wlc)> show sysinfo\r\n Manufacturer's Name.............................. Cisco Systems Inc. Product Name.....................................

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco Wireless LAN Controller Software GUI Privilege Escalation Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20181017-wlc-gui-privesc  First Published: 2018 October 17 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCvh65876](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvh65876)     CVE-2018-0417     CWE-264       CVSS Score: [Base 7.5](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2018-0417     CWE-264       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181017-wlc-gui-privesc/csaf/cisco-sa-20181017-wlc-gui-privesc.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in TACACS authentication with Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform certain operations within the GUI that are not normally available to that user on the CLI.  The vulnerability is due to incorrect parsing of a specific TACACS attribute received in the TACACS response from the remote TACACS server. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating via TACACS to the GUI on the affected device. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to create local user accounts with administrative privileges on an affected WLC and execute other commands that are not allowed from the CLI and should be prohibited.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers that are running a software release prior to the first fixed release and are configured for TACACS authorization. If TACACS authorization is not configured, the WLC is not vulnerable. Determine If TACACS Authorization Is Configured If the **show** **tacacs-server** feature is not available, this indicates that the TACACS feature (**feature tacacs**) is not enabled and the device is not affected by this vulnerability. The following example displays the output an administrator may use to verify if the device is vulnerable.  If no output is shown under the tables after issuing the command **show tacas summary**, the device is not running the TACACS service and is not vulnerable. The following output shows an example of output from a vulnerable device running the TACACS service.  ```   (wlc) >show tacacs summary   Authentication Servers      Idx  Server Address    Port    State     Tout   ---  ----------------  ------  --------  ----   1    10.1.1.12         49      Enabled   2      Authorization Servers      Idx  Server Address    Port    State     Tout   ---  ----------------  ------  --------  ----   1    10.1.1.12         49      Enabled   2      Accounting Servers      Idx  Server Address    Port    State     Tout   ---  ----------------  ------  --------  ----   1    10.1.1.12         49      Enabled   2   ```  For information about which Cisco WLC Software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fixed) section of this advisory. Determining the Cisco WLC Software Release To determine which Cisco WLC Software release is running on a device, administrators can use the controller’s web interface or the CLI.  To use the web interface, do the following:    1. By using a browser, log in to the controller’s web interface   2. Click the **Monitor** tab   3. Click **Summary** in the left pane   4. Under **Controller Summary**, the **Software Version** field shows the release number of the software that is currently running on the device To use the CLI, log in to the controller via Telnet, issue the **show sysinfo** command, and then refer to the value in the **Product Version** field of the command output. The following example shows the command output for a device that is running Cisco WLC Software Release 8.3.102.0:  ```   (wlc)> show sysinfo      Manufacturer's Name.............................. Cisco Systems Inc.   Product Name..................................... Cisco Controller   Product Version.................................. 8.3.102.0   Bootloader Version............................... 1.0.1Field Recovery Image Version..................... 6.0.182.0   Firmware Version................................. FPGA 1.3, Env 1.6, USB console 1.27   Build Type....................................... DATA + WPS   .   .   .   ``` Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. As a mitigation, customers may choose to implement access control lists (ACLs) to filter or restrict management access on a configured device.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.
