"title": "Summary",
"text": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for Advanced Recording Format (ARF) and Webex Recording Format (WRF) files. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by providing a user with a malicious .arf or .wrf file via email or URL and convincing the user to launch the file in the Webex recording players. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow arbitrary code execution on the system of a targeted user. There is no risk when a .arf player that is stored on a Webex site is played in the Webex Network Recording Player.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Webex players are applications that are used to play back Webex meetings that have been recorded by an online meeting attendee. The Webex Network Recording Player for .arf files can be automatically installed when the user accesses a recording that is hosted on a Webex server. The Webex Player for .wrf files can be downloaded manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco has updated affected versions of the ARF and WRF recording players on Cisco Webex Meetings Suite sites, Cisco Webex Meetings Online sites, and Cisco Webex Meetings Server. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180718-webex-rce [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180718-webex-rce\"]"

"text": "The Cisco Webex Meetings Suite services and Cisco WebEx Meetings Online are hosted multimedia conferencing solutions that are managed and maintained by Cisco Webex. Cisco Webex Meetings Server is a multimedia conferencing solution that customers can host in their private clouds.\r\n\r\nCisco Webex Meetings services can be configured to allow recording of a meeting that is stored online and can be downloaded by a user in ARF format. These services can also record meetings directly on local computers in WRF format. The Cisco Webex Network Recording Player plays .arf files and the Cisco Webex Player plays .wrf files.\r\n\r\nThe Network Recording Player can be automatically installed when a user accesses a recording file that is hosted on a Cisco Webex Meetings Suite site (for streaming playback mode). The Cisco Webex Network Recording Player can also be installed manually. The Cisco Webex Player can only be manually installed from the Webex site.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for .arf files is available for Cisco Webex Meetings Suite (WBS31, WBS32, WBS33), Cisco Webex Meetings Online, and for Cisco Webex Meetings Server. The Cisco Webex Player for .wrf files is only available for Cisco Webex Meetings Suite (WBS31, WBS32, and WBS33) and Cisco Webex Meetings Online. The Cisco Webex Player for .wrf files is not available for Cisco Webex Meetings Server.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerabilities disclosed in this advisory affect the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player and the Cisco Webex Player. Windows, OS X, and Linux versions of the players are all affected by at least one vulnerability described in this advisory."

However, it is possible to remove the affected Cisco Webex Network Recording Player and Cisco Webex Player by following the uninstall procedure for the operating system. For example, in Windows, use Add or Remove Programs to uninstall the affected players.\r\n\r\nTo remove Webex software completely from a system, use the Meeting Services Removal Tool (for Microsoft Windows users) or Mac Webex Meeting Application Uninstaller (for Apple Mac OS X users), available for download from the Cisco Collaboration Help article Cisco WebEx and 3rd Party Support Utilities [\"https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/WBX000026396\"].\r\n\r\nRemoval of the Webex software from a Linux or UNIX-based system can be accomplished by following the steps in the Cisco Collaboration Help article How Do I Uninstall WebEx Software on a Linux or Unix Based System? [\"https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/WBX28548\"]."

"title": "Fixed Software",
"text": "Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n Fixed Releases The following versions of the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player and the Cisco Webex Player available from the Cisco Webex Meetings Suite sites (WBS31, WBS32, WBS33), Cisco Webex Meetings Online site, and Cisco Webex Meetings Server address all the vulnerabilities described in this advisory:\r\n\r\nCisco Webex Meetings Suite (WBS31) - Cisco Webex Network Recording Player and Cisco Webex Player versions WBS31.23 and later\r\nCisco Webex Meetings Suite (WBS32) - Cisco Webex Network Recording Player and Cisco Webex Player versions WBS32.15 and later\r\nCisco Webex Meetings Suite (WBS33) - Cisco Webex Network Recording Player and Cisco Webex Player versions WBS33.2 and later\r\nCisco Webex Meetings Online - Webex Network Recording Player and WebEx Player versions 1.3.35 and later\r\nCisco Webex Meetings Server - Webex Network Recording Player versions 3.0MR1 and later\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the latest versions of the ARF and WRF players are available from http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html [\"http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html\"].\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a Cisco Webex meeting site has an updated version of the Cisco Webex Players, users can sign into their Cisco Webex Meetings site and go to the Support > Downloads section. The version is displayed on the right side of the page under About Webex Meetings.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Webex Network Recording Player (for .arf files) will be automatically upgraded to the latest, nonvulnerable version when users access a recording file that is hosted on a Cisco Webex Meetings site that contains the versions previously specified. Users will need to manually uninstall the Cisco Webex Player and get the updated version of the Cisco Webex Player from http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html [\"http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html\"] or from a Cisco Webex Meetings site specified previously.\r\n\r\nNote: Customers on lockdown sites will not automatically get updated versions of the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player and Cisco Webex Player. Contact Webex Support to update a Cisco Webex site and get the updated version of the Cisco Webex Recording Players from http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html [\"http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html\"].\r\n Cisco Bug ID First Fixed Release WBS31 WBS32 WBS33 Webex Meetings Online Webex Meetings Server CSCvi02621 31.23 32.15 33.2 CSCvi02965 1.3.35 CSCvi63329 31.23 32.15 33.2 CSCvi63333 3.0MR1 CSCvi63335 1.3.35 CSCvi63374 31.23 32.15 33.2 CSCvi63376 3.0MR1 CSCvi63377 1.3.35 CSCvi63391 31.23 32.15\r\n 33.0.6\r\n 33.1.1\r\n 33.2\r\n CSCvi63392 3.0MR1 CSCvi63396 1.3.35 CSCvi63495 31.23 32.15 33.2 CSCvi63497 3.0MR1 CSCvi63498 1.3.35 CSCvi82684 31.23 33.2 CSCvi82700 3.0MR1 CSCvi82705 1.3.35 CSCvi82725 31.23 32.15 33.2 CSCvi82737 3.0MR1 CSCvi82742 1.3.35 CSCvi82760 31.23 32.15 33.2 CSCvi82771 1.3.35 CSCvj51284 32.15 33.2\r\n CSCvj51294 1.3.35"

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by providing a user with a malicious *.arf* or *.wrf* file via email or URL and convincing the user to launch the file in the Webex recording players. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow arbitrary code execution on the system of a targeted user. There is no risk when a *.arf* player that is stored on a Webex site is played in the Webex Network Recording Player.  The Cisco Webex players are applications that are used to play back Webex meetings that have been recorded by an online meeting attendee. The Webex Network Recording Player for *.arf* files can be automatically installed when the user accesses a recording that is hosted on a Webex server. The Webex Player for *.wrf* files can be downloaded manually.  Cisco has updated affected versions of the ARF and WRF recording players on Cisco Webex Meetings Suite sites, Cisco Webex Meetings Online sites, and Cisco Webex Meetings Server. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products These vulnerabilities affect ARF and WRF recording players available from Cisco Webex Meetings Suite sites, Cisco Webex Meetings Online sites, and Cisco Webex Meetings Server.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 7.8 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 7.8 |
