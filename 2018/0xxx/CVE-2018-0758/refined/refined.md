{
  "CVE-2018-0758": {
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow in the `Lowerer::LowerSetConcatStrMultiItem` method during string concatenation.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Missing integer overflow check when calculating the length of concatenated strings.",
      "The `Lowerer::LowerSetConcatStrMultiItem` method does not validate the resulting length after adding lengths of the strings. "
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (DoS).",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a script concatenates a large number of strings, causing an integer overflow during length calculation. This results in an incorrect length value being used, leading to a crash or other unexpected behavior.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to be able to execute JavaScript code in Microsoft Edge. This is achievable through a malicious website or by exploiting another vulnerability that allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the browser."
