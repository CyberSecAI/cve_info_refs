The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) frames that pass through the data plane of an affected AP. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by associating to a vulnerable AP, initiating a PPTP VPN connection to an arbitrary PPTP VPN server, and sending a malicious GRE frame through the data plane of the AP. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an internal process of the targeted AP to crash, which in turn would cause the AP to reload. The AP reload would cause a DoS condition for clients that are associated with the AP.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable software release:    + Aironet 1810 Series APs   + Aironet 1830 Series APs   + Aironet 1850 Series APs For information about which software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.
