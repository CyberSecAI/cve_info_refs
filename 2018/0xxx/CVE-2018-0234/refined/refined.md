Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) frames that pass through the data plane of affected Cisco Aironet Access Points. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) implementation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The access points do not properly validate GRE frames received during PPTP connections. This lack of validation allows a malicious GRE frame to trigger a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit causes a critical process (NSS core process) on the access point to crash, which then leads to the access point reloading. This reload disrupts service for clients associated with the affected AP, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.
*   **Network Proximity:**  The attacker must be on the same wireless network as the vulnerable AP.
*   **PPTP Connection:**  The attacker initiates a PPTP connection to the affected AP.
*   **Malicious GRE Frame:** The attacker sends a crafted, malicious GRE frame through the data plane of the access point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be within the wireless network of the vulnerable Cisco Aironet access point.
*   The attacker must be capable of initiating a PPTP connection to the access point.
*   The attacker must be able to craft and send malicious GRE frames.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that this vulnerability was reintroduced.
*   There are no workarounds available to mitigate the vulnerability, and the only solution is to apply the software patches.
*   The vulnerability affects Cisco Aironet 1810, 1830, and 1850 Series Access Points running specific versions of Cisco Mobility Express Software.
*   The vulnerability does not affect Aironet APs running Lightweight AP software or Cisco IOS Software, nor other models such as 1560, 2800, 3800, or Wireless LAN controllers.
