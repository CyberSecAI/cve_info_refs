Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-0707:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a command injection vulnerability in the `change_passwd` API method of the QNAP Q'Center virtual appliance web interface. Specifically, when an admin user changes their password, the application executes an operating system command using the provided input, and this input is not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Command Injection (CWE-77):**  The application directly incorporates user-supplied data (the new password) into a shell command without proper sanitization, allowing the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.
*   **Insecure API Design**: The API requires passwords to be base64 encoded, which makes it easier to inject commands, since the attacker does not need to bypass any filters

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the Q'Center virtual appliance as the 'admin' operating system user.
*   **Full System Compromise:**  Successful exploitation could lead to complete control of the affected system, allowing for data theft, system manipulation, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is accessible through the QNAP Q'Center web interface.
*   **API Endpoint:** The specific vulnerable endpoint is `/hawkeye/v1/account` with the `change_passwd` query.
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The exploit requires sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated to the Q'Center web interface.
*   **Admin Access (or Password Disclosure):** The attacker needs to be logged in as an admin user to exploit the vulnerability directly. However, the exploit can be combined with CVE-2018-0706 where any authenticated user can retrieve the admin user's password.
*   **Knowledge of API:** The attacker needs knowledge of the specific API endpoint and parameters to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details (beyond the CVE description):**

*   **Base64 encoding:** The API requires the password to be base64 encoded.
*   **Sudo Execution:** The password change is executed by a "sudo passwd" command in the underlying OS, where the injected command gets executed.
*   **Metasploit Module:** A Metasploit module exists that can automate the exploitation of this vulnerability
*   **Privilege Escalation Path**: The exploit can be chained with CVE-2018-0706, which allows any authenticated user to obtain the admin user password, effectively escalating privileges to admin if a lower-privileged account is available.
*   **Vulnerable Versions:** The vulnerability affects QNAP Q'Center Virtual Appliance versions prior to 1.7.1083. The advisory specifically mentions versions 1.6.1056 and 1.6.1075 as vulnerable.

**In summary, CVE-2018-0707 details a critical command injection vulnerability in the QNAP Q'Center Virtual Appliance that allows authenticated users (or any user leveraging another vulnerability to get admin credentials) to execute arbitrary commands on the system by exploiting the password change functionality.**
