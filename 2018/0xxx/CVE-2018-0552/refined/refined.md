Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-0552:

**Root Cause:**
The installer for PhishWall Client Firefox and Chrome edition for Windows has an issue with the DLL search path. This can lead to the installer insecurely loading Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure DLL Loading:** The installer does not properly validate the location of DLL files it loads, making it vulnerable to DLL hijacking/planting attacks. This corresponds to CWE-427 (Uncontrolled Search Path Element).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the installer.
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local:** The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in a location where the installer will search for it.
- **User Interaction:** Requires the user to run the vulnerable installer

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in a location where the installer will search.
- The attacker must rely on the user running the installer to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects the installer only, not the installed software itself.
- Users are advised to use the latest installer provided by the vendor
- Windows 7 users may need to apply the KB2533623 patch before using the updated installer
- The analysis assumes the user is tricked into placing a malicious DLL file in a specific folder.
