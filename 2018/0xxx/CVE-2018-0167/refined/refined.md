      "summary": "A buffer overflow vulnerability in the LLDP subsystem of Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XE Software, and Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an adjacent, unauthenticated attacker to cause a DoS condition or execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.",
      "details": "The vulnerability is due to improper error handling of malformed LLDP messages. An attacker who is connected directly to an interface of an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by submitting an LLDP protocol data unit (PDU) that is designed to trigger the issue. If successful, an exploitable buffer overflow condition may occur that could result in a DoS condition or the attacker gaining the ability to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.",

      "vulnerability_types": [
        "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer",
         "Buffer Overflow"
      ],
       "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in loss of availability, confidentiality, and/or integrity caused by memory exhaustion, module restart, information corruption, and/or information exposure, denial of service (DoS) condition or the attacker gaining the ability to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.",
      "attack_vector": "An adjacent, unauthenticated attacker",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be connected directly to an interface of an affected device.",
        "remediation": "Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. See the advisories for specific software versions. Rockwell Automation recommends users upgrade to FRN 15.2(6)E1 or later."
