Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0450:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of Cisco Data Center Network Manager.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to inadequate input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary script code within the context of the web interface.
- An attacker could potentially access sensitive browser-based information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (remote).
- An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious link and persuading a user to click it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted link to a user of the affected management interface.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in the web management interface of Cisco DCNM. An unauthenticated attacker can trick a user into clicking a malicious link, which then allows the attacker to execute arbitrary javascript code in the victim's browser session. This could lead to session hijacking or data theft. The vulnerability is rated as medium severity.
