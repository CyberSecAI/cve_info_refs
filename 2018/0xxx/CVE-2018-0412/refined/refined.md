CVE-2018-0412:
  - Root cause: Improper processing of certain Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN (EAPOL) messages during the Wi-Fi handshake process.
  - Weakness: Encryption algorithm downgrade.
  - Impact: An attacker can force the usage of a less secure WPA-TKIP cipher instead of AES-CCMP, potentially leading to subsequent cryptographic attacks and disclosure of confidential information.
  - Attack vector: An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker can establish a man-in-the-middle position between a supplicant and an authenticator. The attacker then manipulates EAPOL message exchange.
  - Required capabilities: The attacker needs to be in an adjacent network position to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
