The provided content relates to CVE-2018-0596.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insecure DLL search path within multiple Microsoft Windows applications and installers. This allows them to load Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) from the same directory where the application or installer resides.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-427:** Uncontrolled Search Path Element. The applications and installers do not properly control the locations from which they load DLLs.
-  **DLL planting:**  The applications are vulnerable to "Application Directory (App Dir) DLL planting," where a malicious DLL can be placed in the same directory as the application or installer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user invoking the application or installer.
- A crafted DLL can be loaded and executed by the vulnerable application or installer.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local: An attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in the same directory as the vulnerable application or installer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL file in the same directory where a vulnerable application/installer resides.
- Requires user interaction, as the user needs to execute the vulnerable application or installer.
- The vulnerability is exploitable by a user, without requiring elevated privileges.
- The attack vector is local.
