| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco IOS and IOS XE Software Bidirectional Forwarding Detection Denial of Service Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20180328-bfd  First Published: 2018 March 28 16:00 GMT  Last Updated:  2022 December 15 22:19 GMT  Version 1.4:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCvc40729](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvc40729)     CVE-2018-0155     CWE-388       CVSS Score: [Base 8.6](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2018-0155     CWE-388       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-bfd/csaf/cisco-sa-20180328-bfd.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) offload implementation of Cisco Catalyst 4500 Series Switches and Cisco Catalyst 4500-X Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a crash of the *iosd* process, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition.  The vulnerability is due to insufficient error handling when the BFD header in a BFD packet is incomplete. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted BFD message to or across an affected switch. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a reload of the system.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-bfd>  This advisory is part of the March 28, 2018, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 20 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 22 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: March 2018 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-66682).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software and the BFD feature is enabled:    + Catalyst 4500 Supervisor Engine 6-E (K5)1   + Catalyst 4500 Supervisor Engine 6L-E (K5)1   + Catalyst 4500 Supervisor Engine 7-E (K10)2   + Catalyst 4500 Supervisor Engine 7L-E (K10)2   + Catalyst 4500E Supervisor Engine 8-E (K10)3   + Catalyst 4500E Supervisor Engine 8L-E (K10)4   + Catalyst 4500E Supervisor Engine 9-E (K10)5   + Catalyst 4500-X Series Switches (K10)2   + Catalyst 4900M Switch (K5)1   + Catalyst 4948E[-F] Ethernet Switch (K5)1 1. BFD feature support as of Cisco IOS Software release 15.1(1)SG2. BFD feature support as of Cisco IOS XE Software release 3.5.0E3. BFD feature support as of Cisco IOS XE Software release 3.6.0E4. BFD feature support as of Cisco IOS XE Software release 3.8.1E5. BFD feature support as of Cisco IOS XE Software release 3.10.0E  This vulnerability can be exploited only if the BFD feature is enabled on an affected device. The BFD feature is enabled by default in Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software if the software is running an IP Base (*ipbase*) package license or a higher license. The BFD feature is not supported by a LAN Base (*lanbase*) package license. For more information, see [LAN Base, IP Base, and Enterprise Services Image Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL_29986-01.html#23636).  For information about which Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fixed) section of this advisory. Determining Whether the BFD Feature Is Enabled To determine whether the BFD feature is enabled on a device, administrators can use the **show running-config | include feature bfd** command in privileged EXEC mode. The following example shows the output of the **show running-config | include feature bfd** command on a Cisco Catalyst Switch that has the BFD feature disabled:  ```   switch# show running-config | include feature bfd  platform module all feature bfd disable platform module feature bfd disable platform feature bfd disable feature bfd disable   ```  Empty output from the **show running-config | include feature bfd** command would indicate that the BFD feature is enabled. Determining Which Package License Is Enabled To determine which package license is enabled on a device, administrators can use the **show license feature** command in privileged EXEC mode. The following example shows the output of the **show license feature** command on a Cisco Catalyst Switch that has the IP Base (*ipbase*) package license enabled:  ```   C4500# show license feature      Feature name        Enforcement  Evaluation  Clear Allowed  Enabled   Right...     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------   entservices         true         true        true           false     true         ipbase              true         false       true           true      false        lanbase             false        false       true           false     false        internal_service    true         false       true           false     false        ```  If a software release does not support the **show license feature** command, administrators can determine which package license is enabled on a device by identifying the type of software image that is currently running on the device. To identify the type of software image that is running on a device, administrators can use the **show version | include image** command in privileged EXEC mode. The following example shows the output of the **show version | include image** command on a Cisco Catalyst Switch that is running a software image that has the LAN Base (*lanbase*) package license enabled:  ```   C4948E# show version | include image   ```  ```   System image file is "bootflash:cat4500e-lanbasek9-mz.151-2.SG3.bin"   ```  Determining the Cisco IOS Software Release To determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the **show version** command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to *Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software* or *Cisco IOS Software*. The banner also displays the installed image name in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.5(2)T1 and has an installed image name of *C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M*:  ```   Router> show version      Cisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)   Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport   Copyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.   Compiled Mon 22-Jun-15 09:32 by prod_rel_team   .   .   .   ```  For information about the naming and numbering conventions for Cisco IOS Software releases, see the [Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/ios-nx-os-reference-guide.html). Determining the Cisco IOS XE Software Release To determine which Cisco IOS XE Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the **show version** command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS XE Software, the system banner displays *Cisco IOS Software*, *Cisco IOS XE Software*, or similar text.  The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 16.2.1 and has an installed image name of *CAT3K\_CAA-UNIVERSALK9-M*:  ```   ios-xe-device# show version      Cisco IOS Software, Catalyst L3 Switch Software (CAT3K_CAA-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version Denali 16.2.1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)   Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport   Copyright (c) 1986-2016 by Cisco Systems, Inc.   Compiled Sun 27-Mar-16 21:47 by mcpre   .   .   .   ```  For information about the naming and numbering conventions for Cisco IOS XE Software releases, see the [Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/ios-nx-os-reference-guide.html). Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the Cisco Catalyst 4500 Series Supervisor Engine V-10GE (K2) or the Cisco Catalyst 4948 Switch (K2).  Cisco has also confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco IOS XR Software or Cisco NX-OS Software.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Administrators who do not use the BFD feature in their environments can disable the feature by using the **feature bfd disable** command in global configuration mode. The **feature bfd disable** command is available in Cisco IOS Software Releases 15.2(1)E and later and Cisco IOS XE Software Releases 3.5.0E and later.  Administrators who do use the BFD feature in their environments can implement [Control Plane Policing (CoPP)](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/XE3-10-0E/configuration/guide/xe-310-cg.pdf) to allow processing of BFD packets from known BFD peers only and drop all other BFD traffic to limit exposure.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.  **Customers Without Service Contracts**  Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.          Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides a tool, the [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x), that identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).  Customers can use this tool to perform the following tasks:    + Initiate a search by choosing one or more releases from a drop-down list or uploading a file from a local system for the tool to parse   + Enter the output of the **show version** command for the tool to parse   + Create a custom search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication To determine whether a release is affected by any published Cisco Security Advisory, use the [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) on Cisco.com or enter a Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software release-for example, **15.1(4)M2** or **3.13.8S**-in the following field:               For a mapping of Cisco IOS XE Software releases to Cisco IOS Software releases, refer to the [Cisco IOS XE 2 Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/2/release/notes/rnasr21/rnasr21_gen.html#wp3000032), [Cisco IOS XE 3S Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/3/release/notes/asr1k_rn_3s_rel_notes/asr1k_rn_3s_sys_req.html#wp3069754), or [Cisco IOS XE 3SG Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL_24726.html#pgfId-2570252), depending on the Cisco IOS XE Software release.

The BFD feature is enabled by default in Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software if the software is running an IP Base (ipbase) package license or a higher license. The BFD feature is not supported by a LAN Base (lanbase) package license. For more information, see LAN Base, IP Base, and Enterprise Services Image Support [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL\_29986-01.html#23636\"].\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fixed\"] section of this advisory.\r\n Determining Whether the BFD Feature Is Enabled\r\nTo determine whether the BFD feature is enabled on a device, administrators can use the show running-config | include feature bfd command in privileged EXEC mode. The following example shows the output of the show running-config | include feature bfd command on a Cisco Catalyst Switch that has the BFD feature disabled:\r\n\r\n\r\nswitch# show running-config | include feature bfd\r\n\r\nplatform module all feature bfd disable\r\nplatform module feature bfd disable\r\nplatform feature bfd disable\r\nfeature bfd disable\r\n\r\nEmpty output from the show running-config | include feature bfd command would indicate that the BFD feature is enabled.\r\n Determining Which Package License Is Enabled\r\nTo determine which package license is enabled on a device, administrators can use the show license feature command in privileged EXEC mode.

If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides a tool, the Cisco IOS Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"], that identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).\r\n\r\nCustomers can use this tool to perform the following tasks:\r\n\r\nInitiate a search by choosing one or more releases from a drop-down list or uploading a file from a local system for the tool to parse\r\nEnter the output of the show version command for the tool to parse\r\nCreate a custom search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a release is affected by any published Cisco Security Advisory, use the Cisco IOS Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] on Cisco.com or enter a Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software release—for example, 15.1(4)M2 or 3.13.8S—in the following field:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a mapping of Cisco IOS XE Software releases to Cisco IOS Software releases, refer to the Cisco IOS XE 2 Release Notes [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios\_xe/2/release/notes/rnasr21/rnasr21\_gen.html#wp3000032\"], Cisco IOS XE 3S Release Notes [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios\_xe/3/release/notes/asr1k\_rn\_3s\_rel\_notes/asr1k\_rn\_3s\_sys\_req.html#wp3069754\"], or Cisco IOS XE 3SG Release Notes [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL\_24726.html#pgfId-2570252\"], depending on the Cisco IOS XE Software release."

* **CVSS v3 9.8**
* **ATTENTION**: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit.
* **Vendor**: Rockwell Automation
* **Equipment**: Allen-Bradley Stratix Industrial Managed Ethernet Switch
* **Vulnerabilities**: Improper Input Validation, Resource Management Errors, 7PK – Errors, Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, Use of Externally-Controlled Format String.

## 2. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in loss of availability, confidentiality, and/or integrity caused by memory exhaustion, module restart, information corruption, and/or information exposure.

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following versions of Allen-Bradley Stratix Industrial Managed Ethernet Switch use a vulnerable version of Cisco IOS or IOS XE:

* Allen-Bradley Stratix 8300 Industrial Managed Ethernet Switches, versions 15.2(4a)EA5 and earlier.

### 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

### 3.2.1   [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)

A vulnerability in the Smart Install feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to trigger a reload of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition, or to execute arbitrary code on an affected device.

The vulnerability is due to improper validation of packet data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted Smart Install message to an affected device on TCP port 4786. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow on the affected device.

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Rockwell Automation reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC from the semi-annual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Rockwell Automation has released the following knowledge base article 1073315:

<https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1073315/> (login required)

Cisco has released new Snort Rules at <https://www.cisco.com/web/software/286271056/117258/sf-rules-2018-03-29-new.html> to help address the following vulnerabilities:

* CVE-2018-0171 - Snort Rule 46096 and 46097
* CVE-2018-0156 - Snort Rule 41725
* CVE-2018-0174 - Snort Rule 46120
* CVE-2018-0172 - Snort Rule 46104
* CVE-2018-0173 - Snort Rule 46119

Cisco adds the following notes for the Smart Install vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-0171 and CVE-2018-0156):

* Smart Install is turned off by express setup; however, upgraded switches but not re-setup may have it enabled.
* Disable the Smart Install feature with the no vstack configuration command if it is not needed or once setup is complete.
* Users who do use the feature—and need to leave it enabled—can use ACLs to block incoming traffic on TCP port 4786.

CVE-2018-0155: Administrators who do not use the BFD feature in their environments can disable the BFD feature by using the feature bfd disable command in global configuration mode to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. Administrators who do use the BFD feature can implement Control Plane Policing (CoPP) to allow processing of BFD packets from known BFD peers only and drop all other BFD traffic to limit exposure.

CVE-2018-0167 and CVE-2018-0175 have no specific mitigations in place. See the following Cisco advisory for more details:

<https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-lldp>

Rockwell Automation also recommends that users implement the following general security guidelines:

* Help minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and confirm that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS-CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the [ICS-CERT website.](/ics/)

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 8.6 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.6 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 8.6 |
