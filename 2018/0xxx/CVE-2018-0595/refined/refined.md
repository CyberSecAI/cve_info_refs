Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0595:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is "Application Directory (App Dir) DLL planting". The installer of Skype for Windows, along with other applications and installers, insecurely loads Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) from the same directory where the installer resides. This occurs due to an issue with the DLL search path.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure DLL loading: The application/installer searches for and loads DLLs from its own directory, which is not secure.
- [CWE-427](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html): Uncontrolled Search Path Element.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: If a malicious DLL is placed in the same directory as the vulnerable installer, it will be loaded and executed with the same privileges as the user running the installer.
- Complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability

**Attack vectors:**
- Local: The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in the same directory as the vulnerable installer before the installer is executed.
- User Interaction: The user must execute the installer for the malicious code to be executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to place a malicious DLL in the same directory as the installer
- The user must run the installer

**Additional details:**
- Microsoft acknowledges the issue as "App Dir DLL planting" but does not plan to release security updates.
- The provided JVN report lists several affected products, each with a separate CVE ID.
- The vulnerability is rated as a CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 (High).
- The JPCERT analysis assumes the user is tricked into placing a malicious DLL file.
- Workarounds are suggested to mitigate the risk of this vulnerability
