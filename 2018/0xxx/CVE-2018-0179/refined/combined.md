For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this security advisory.  There are no workarounds that address both vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-slogin>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products These vulnerabilities affect Cisco devices that are running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.4(2)T, 15.4(3)M, or 15.4(2)CG and later.  Determining the Cisco IOS Software Release To determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the **show version** command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to *Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software* or *Cisco IOS Software*. The banner also displays the installed image name in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the **show version** command or may provide different output.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Cisco has confirmed that these vulnerabilities do not affect IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software.  Details  * The Cisco IOS Login Enhancements (Login Block) Feature The Cisco IOS Login Enhancements (Login Block) feature allows users to enhance the security of a router by configuring options to automatically block further login attempts when a possible DoS attack is detected.  The login block and login delay options introduced by this feature can be configured for Telnet or SSH virtual connections. By enabling this feature, you can slow down “dictionary attacks” by enforcing a “quiet period” if multiple failed connection attempts are detected, thereby protecting the routing device from a type of DoS attack.  Further information on the Login Enhancements (Login Block) feature is available in the [Cisco IOS Security Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/sec_user_services/configuration/guide/12_4/sec_securing_user_services_12-4_book/sec_login_enhance.html). Vulnerability Details Two vulnerabilities in the Login Enhancements (Login Block) feature of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.  The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another; exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows.  *Cisco IOS Software Login Block Denial of Service Vulnerability*  A vulnerability in the Login Enhancements (Login Block) feature of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of an affected system, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.  The vulnerability is due to an attempt to free an area of memory that has not been previously allocated. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to log in to an affected device via Secure Shell (SSH) or Telnet with invalid credentials multiple times.  This vulnerability is exploitable only if both of the following conditions are met:    + **login quiet-mode access-class** has been configured prior to configuring **login block-for**. These features are not enabled by default.   + The device has not been reloaded since that configuration occurred. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2018-0179  The Security Impact Rating (SIR) for this vulnerability is: Medium  The Cisco bug ID for this vulnerability is: CSCuy32360  *Cisco IOS Software Login Block Denial of Service Vulnerability*  A vulnerability in the Login Enhancements (Login Block) feature of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of an affected system, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.  The vulnerability is due to an attempt to free an area of memory that has not been previously allocated. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to log in to an affected device via SSH or Telnet with invalid credentials multiple times while the administrator modifies the **login block-for** configuration.  This vulnerability is exploitable only if **login block-for** has been configured on an affected device. This feature is not enabled by default.  The CVE ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2018-0180  The SIR for this vulnerability is: Medium  The Cisco bug ID for this vulnerability is: CSCuz60599  Indicators of Compromise  * The following conditions can indicate that a compromise has occurred. Cisco IOS Software Login Block Denial of Service Vulnerability - CSCuy32360 Immediately before the device crashes and reloads, the device will log messages similar to the following example at least twice:  ```   %SEC_LOGIN-4-LOGIN_FAILED: Login failed [user: USERNAME] [Source: xx.xx.xx.xx [localport: 22] [Reason: Login Authentication Failed] at 03:37:06 UTC Sat Feb 13 2016%SEC_LOGIN-1-QUIET_MODE_ON: Still timeleft for watching failures is 52 secs, [user: USERNAME] [Source: xx.xx.xx.xx] [localport: 22] [Reason: Login Authentication Failed] [ACL: LOGIN_ACL] at 03:37:06 UTC Sat Feb 13 2016   ```  Exploitation of this vulnerability will cause an affected device to generate a *crashinfo* file. Contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to review the output of the **show tech-support** command and the *crashinfo* file to determine whether the device has been compromised by exploitation of this vulnerability. Cisco IOS Software Login Block Denial of Service Vulnerability - CSCuz60599 After this vulnerability has been exploited on an affected system, the device will log an error message about a bad chunk reference count in process *Secure Login* similar to the following example:  ```   %SYS-2-CHUNKBADREFCOUNT: Bad chunk reference count, chunk 3F57D864 data 3F589728 refcount FFFFFFFF alloc pc 323635BC. -Process= "Secure Login", ipl= 0, pid= 388   ```  Exploitation of this vulnerability will cause an affected device to generate a *crashinfo* file. Contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to review the output of the **show tech-support** command and the *crashinfo* file to determine whether the device has been compromised by exploitation of this vulnerability.  Workarounds  * As a workaround for the vulnerability described in CSCuy32360, administrators can take one of the following actions:    + Configure **login block-for** *prior* to configuring **login quiet-mode access-class**   + Ensure that the device is reloaded after **login block-for** and **login quiet-mode access-class** are configured There are no workarounds that address the vulnerability described in CSCuz60599.

| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 6.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 6.8 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 6.8 |
