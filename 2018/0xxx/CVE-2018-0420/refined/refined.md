Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0420:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper sanitization of user-supplied input within HTTP request parameters. Specifically, the parameters that describe filenames and pathnames are not correctly processed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The core weakness is a directory traversal vulnerability. An attacker can use directory traversal techniques (e.g., `../`) to manipulate the path to access files outside of the intended directory.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The system fails to properly sanitize user-provided input within HTTP parameters, allowing directory traversal sequences to be processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** A successful exploit allows the attacker to view system files on the targeted device. These files may contain sensitive information, which can be used for further attacks or unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The attack is performed remotely over the network via the web-based interface.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack uses crafted HTTP requests with modified path parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable Cisco Wireless LAN Controller device.
