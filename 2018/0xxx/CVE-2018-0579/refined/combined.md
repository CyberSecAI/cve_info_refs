## Description

This plugin improves the sharing of your WordPress pages, posts, WooCommerce products, or any other post type on social media, by setting the correct Facebook Open Graph Tags.

It also allows you to add the Twitter Card tags for more effective and efficient Twitter sharing results, as well as the Meta Description and Canonical tags if no other SEO plugin is setting them.

**This plugin is not, in any way, affiliated or endorsed by Facebook, Twitter, Google or any other 3rd party.**

You can also choose to insert the “enclosure” and “media:content” tags to the RSS feeds, so that apps like RSS Graffiti and twitterfeed post the image to Facebook correctly.

It allows the user to choose which tags are included, and also the default image if the post/page doesn’t have one.

It’s also possible to add an overlay logo/watermark to the image. The plugin will resize and crop the original image to 1200×630 and then overlay the chosen 1200×630 PNG file over it.

It be usefull to add your brand to the image that shows up on Facebook shared links.

Our settings page is discreetly kept under “Options”.

#### The generated (Facebook) Open Graph Tags are:

* **og:title**: From post/page/archive/tag/… title.
* **og:site\_name**: From blog title.
* **og:url**: From the post/page permalink.
* **og:description**: From our specific custom field of the post/page, or if not set post/page excerpt if it exist, or from post/page content. From category/tag description on its pages, if it exist. From tagline, or custom text, on all the others.
* **og:image**: From our specific custom field of the post/page, or if not set from the post/page featured/thumbnail image, or if it doesn’t exist from the first image in the post content, or if it doesn’t exist from the first image on the post media gallery, or if it doesn’t exist from the default image defined on the options menu. The same image chosen here will be used and enclosure/media:content on the RSS feed.
* **og:image:url**: Same as **og:image**.
* **og:image:secure\_url**: Same as **og:image** if SSL is being used.
* **og:image:width** and **og:image:height**: Image dimensions.
* **og:type**: “website” or “blog” for the homepage, “product” for WooCommerce products and “article” for all the others.
* **article:author**: From the user (post author) Faceboook Profile URL.

* **[WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/)**: On product pages sets `og:type` to “product” and adds the price including tax to the `product:price` and `product:availability` tags. Also allows you to use the Product Category thumbnails as Open Graph Image and have Product Gallery images as additional Open Graph Images
* **[WooCommerce Brands](https://woocommerce.com/products/brands/)**: On brand pages uses the brand image as Open Graph Image
* **[Business Directory Plugin](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/business-directory-plugin/)** (deprecated): Allows you to use BDP listing contents as Open Graph Tags.

## Installation

1. Use the included automatic install feature on your WordPress admin panel and search for Open Graph and Twitter Card Tags.
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
3. Go to `Options`, `Open Graph and Twitter Card Tags` to set it up

## FAQ

### Facebook is not showing up the correct image when I share a post. What can I do?

1. Are you using a big enough image? The minimum image size is 200×200 pixels but we recommend 1200×630.
2. Are you sure you only have one `og:image` tag on the source code? Make sure you’re not using more than one plugin to set OG tags?
3. Go to the [Facebook Sharing Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/), insert your URL, click `Debug`. Then click on `Scrape Again` to make sure Facebook gets the current version of your HTML code and not a cached version. If the image that shows up on the preview (bottom of the page) is the correct one, then the tags are well set and it “should” be the one that Facebook uses when sharing the post. If it still does not use the correct image when sharing, despite the debugger shows it correctly, there’s nothing more we can do about that. That’s just Facebook being Facebook.

### What is the “Manually update Facebook cache” button on the “Post updated” notice?

It’s a shortcut to the Facebook Sharing Debugger, where you should click on `Scrape Again` to make sure Facebook gets the current version of your post or page.

### When I save/edit my post I get the “Facebook Open Graph Tags cache NOT updated/purged” error. Should I worry?

Each time you edit a post, if the option “Try to update Facebook Open Graph Tags cache when saving the post” is activated, we’ll try to notify Facebook of the changes so it clears up its cache and read the new Open Graph tags of this specific URL.

If this is a new post and it’s the first time you’re saving it, the error is “normal” and you should ignore it (we’re looking at a workaround to not show you this error).

If this is not a new post and it’s not the first time you’re saving it, and if this happens always, then maybe your server does not support calling remote URLs with PHP and you should disable the “Try to update Facebook Open Graph Tags cache when saving the post” option. In that scenario we recommend you use the [Facebook Sharing Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/) to `Scrape Again` each time you update your post.

Sometimes the plugin just can’t update the Facebook cache itself and you may need to do it manually on the link provided above.

### Can I authenticate the call to Facebook, with my own app, when trying to update the cache, so I get rid of the “An access token is required to request this resource” error?

Yes, you can. Create a Facebook App and fill in the details on the “Facebook Open Graph Tags cache” panel of the plugin settings page.

Do NOT ask us support on this. There is a [blog post](https://wpexperts.io/blog/update-facebook-sharing-cache-with-facebook-open-graph-plugin/) explaining everything you need to do.

### Facebook says “The following required properties are missing: fb:app\_id”. Should I worry?

No. Move along.

### How can I share my posts or products as Rich Pins on Pinterest?

Pinterest can read Open Graph tags, so no extra tags are needed to share your articles or WooCommerce products as Rich Pins.

You need however to apply to whitelist your domain on Pinterest. Head to [this page](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/rich-pins/overview/) and follow the instructions starting with “Set up”. When in the validator, enter your URL, hit “Validate” and then choose “HTML tags” and hit “Apply now”. It’s then up to Pinterest to accept your application or not.

### Can this plugin get content from “random plugin”?

If there’s a popular plugin you think we could get content from to use on the meta tags, use the support forum to tell us that.

If you are a plugin or theme author you can always use our filters `fb_og_title`, `fb_og_desc`, `fb_og_url`, `fb_og_type`, `fb_type_schema`, `fb_og_image`, `fb_og_image_additional`, `fb_og_image_overlay`, `fb_og_locale`, `fb_og_app_id`, `fb_og_thumb_fill_color`, `fb_og_output` and `fb_og_enabled` to customize the Open Graph (and other) meta tags output.

### What is the array structure for the `fb\_og\_image\_additional` filter?

Check out this [code snippet](https://gist.github.com/webdados/ef5d5db01f01bee6041c2b2e0950d73a).

### I’m getting a white screen of death / truncated HTML

Go to the plugin settings and check the `Do not get image size` option.

This happens on some edge cases we haven’t yet been able to identify.

Update: Probably fixed for some users on 2.1.4.5 and completely on 2.2 (pending confirmation)

### Can I use Yoast SEO alongside this plugin?

You can (and, in our opinion, you should) use both plugins. If you want to use Yoast SEO for your SEO needs and our plugin for social media meta tags you just have to go to “SEO > Social” and disable settings for Facebook and Twitter.

If you don’t find that option, because they’ve now made it harder to reach, you have to go to “SEO > Dashboard > Features > Advanced settings pages > choose Enabled and Save changes”. Then you can reach “SEO > Social”.

Then set up our plugin as you wish and you’re ready to go.

We like to work with everybody, so (if you want to) our plugin can even integrate with Yoast SEO and use it’s title, description and canonical URL on the Facebook and Twitter tags.

Doesn’t work for showing facebook or twitter images. And the developer has apparently abandoned this plug in, looking for someone to sell it to.

If you only need twitter and facebook cards for your articles, this is the plugin you need install, Yoas allow this function in premium version so it’s great have this function free. Thanks Webdados (Marco Almeida), great work!

* Added the information about the recommended minimum image size.

#### 0.1.9.5

* It’s now possible to choose how the post/page `og:image` tag is set. It means that if the user doesn’t want to use the featured/thumbnail image, or the first image in the post content, or the first image on the media gallery, or even the default image, he can choose not to.

* Fixed the namespace declarations.

#### 0.1.8

* Type “website” was being used as default for all the urls beside posts. This is wrong. According to Facebook Open Graph specification only the homepage should be “website” and all the other contents must bu “article”. This was fixed.

* If the description comes out empty, the title is used on this tag.

If you want to keep a specific tag from another plugin, you can just disable that tag on this plugin options.

#### 0.1.6

* Settings link now shows up on the plugins list.
* Small fix to ensure admin functions only are running when on the admin interface.

* Changed `og:app_id` and `og:admins` not to be included by default.

#### 0.1.3

* Just fixing some typos.

#### 0.1.2
