Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-0752

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how Windows handles the impersonation of the anonymous token within a Low-Privilege App Container (LPAC). When an LPAC attempts to impersonate the anonymous token, the `WIN://NOAPPALLPKG` security attribute, which is meant to prevent the use of the `ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES` SID, is not correctly applied to the new token. Specifically, during the `SepGetAnonymousToken` process, this attribute is ignored when creating the impersonated token.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Attribute Handling:** The `WIN://NOAPPALLPKG` attribute is not correctly propagated to the impersonated anonymous token.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The failure to apply the attribute results in the creation of a "normal" Access Control (AC) anonymous token instead of an LPAC token. This allows the attacker to bypass the intended restrictions of an LPAC.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** An attacker can escalate their privileges from a low-privileged LPAC to a normal AC context.
- **Access to Restricted Resources:** With a normal AC token, an attacker can gain access to resources that are protected by the `ANONYMOUS LOGON` and `ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES` SIDs, but not by `ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES` or specific capability SIDs.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to be able to execute code within an LPAC environment (such as Microsoft Edge).
- The attacker then needs to trigger the impersonation of the anonymous token.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to execute code in an LPAC context (e.g., as an application running within an app container).
- The attacker needs the ability to trigger the `NtImpersonateAnonymousToken` function within the LPAC context.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit was tested on Windows 10 versions 1703 and 1709.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) is available, written in C#, that can be used to demonstrate the vulnerability. The PoC spawns a process as the Microsoft Edge LPAC, then exploits the vulnerability to obtain a non-LPAC anonymous token.
