Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-0252:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the IP Version 4 (IPv4) fragment reassembly function of the Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) software.
*   Specifically, it's caused by a corruption of an internal data structure that occurs when the affected software reassembles certain IPv4 packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Improper handling of malformed IPv4 fragments during reassembly.
*   Corruption of internal data structures due to the above.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A successful exploit can cause the affected Cisco WLC device to reload unexpectedly.
*   This leads to a denial of service (DoS) condition, disrupting network operations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack is performed remotely over the network.
*   It involves sending specifically crafted, malformed IPv4 fragments to the targeted device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device.
*   The attacker needs to be capable of crafting and sending malformed IPv4 packets.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Cisco 3500, 5500, and 8500 Series Wireless LAN Controllers.
*   Specifically, it impacts all releases of 8.4 until a patched version, and releases 8.5.103.0 and 8.5.105.0 for the listed controllers.
*   There are no workarounds available to mitigate this vulnerability other than upgrading.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address this issue.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
* The CVSS score is 8.6, which is considered high.
