Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-0410:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper memory resource management for TCP connections within the web proxy functionality of Cisco AsyncOS Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Inadequate handling of memory resources allocated to TCP connections.
- Failure to release memory resources associated with established TCP connections.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exhaust system memory by establishing numerous TCP connections. This can cause the affected system to stop processing new connections, resulting in a DoS condition.
- System recovery may require manual intervention, such as rebooting the device or restarting the web proxy process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker.
- Exploitation occurs via a high number of TCP connections to the data interface of an affected device via IPv4 or IPv6.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to establish a high number of TCP connections to the vulnerable device's data interface.
- No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

- Affected Products: Cisco AsyncOS Software Releases 9.1, 10.1, 10.5, and 11.0 for Cisco Web Security Appliances (both virtual and hardware) with HTTPS Proxy enabled.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the HTTPS Proxy feature is enabled (disabled by default).
- The accumulation of TCP connections in the CLOSE_WAIT state, as observed with the `netstat` command, is an indicator of compromise.
- Recovery can be achieved by rebooting the device or restarting the web proxy process using the `diagnostic > PROXY > kick` command.
- Cisco released software updates to address the vulnerability. No workarounds are available.
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
