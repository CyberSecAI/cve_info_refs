Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0504:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how MediaWiki's `Special:Redirect/logid` page handles log events, specifically when those events are (partially) hidden or suppressed. When a log event is hidden, `Special:Redirect/logid` can link to the incorrect log and reveal the hidden information. This is because it doesn't properly respect access restrictions when resolving a log event by its ID and can therefore leak information which should be protected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of information that should be hidden from users without the necessary permissions.
*   **Insecure Redirect:** `Special:Redirect/logid` does not correctly check user permissions when redirecting to log events based on the log ID. This allows the bypass of intended access controls.
*   **API Inconsistency:** The API correctly hides the information, whereas `Special:Redirect/logid` does not, creating an inconsistency in access control enforcement.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Sensitive information within hidden log events, such as usernames, IPs, or the details of the log action itself, can be revealed to unauthorized users. This information could be used for further malicious activities.
*   **Circumvention of Privacy Controls:** The vulnerability undermines the intended purpose of hiding or suppressing log event details, therefore circumventing privacy controls.
*   **Compromised Trust:** When hidden information is exposed, trust in the system's security and privacy measures is diminished.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Manipulation:** Attackers can directly craft URLs using `Special:Redirect/logid/` and a target log ID to access hidden log entries.
*  **Links from malicious users** If a user has a link to the `Special:Redirect/logid/` page they can use that to get access to the hidden information

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Log IDs:** Attackers need to know the log ID of a hidden or partially hidden log event.
*   **Basic URL manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the URL in order to trigger the vulnerable `Special:Redirect/logid` page.
*   **No authentication or specific permissions required** In the case that `Special:Redirect/logid` is publicly accessible, no authentication is needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Technical Details:**

* The issue is related to the implementation of `Special:Redirect/logid`, which was created to allow browsing of log events using their ID. This functionality was added with the commit `rMW1b294bd3c538`.
* The bug occurs because `Special:Redirect/logid` tries to fetch the log event, but the logic didn't properly check user permissions or redaction rules, which led to information disclosure.
* The fix involves implementing permission checks within `Special:Log`, so that it handles log events according to user permissions.
* The fix was to use a `logid` parameter in `Special:Log` instead of fetching the information through `Special:Redirect`

**Affected Software:**

*   MediaWiki versions prior to 1.31.1, 1.30.1, 1.29.3, and 1.27.5.

**Resolution:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in MediaWiki versions 1.31.1, 1.30.1, 1.29.3, and 1.27.5 by adding the `logid` parameter to `Special:Log` and checking the permissions properly.

**CVSS Score:**

*   The Red Hat Security Advisory rates this as a **Low** severity issue.

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to the patched versions of MediaWiki mentioned above.
