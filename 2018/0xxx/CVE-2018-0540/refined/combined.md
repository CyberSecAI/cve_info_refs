# JVN#56764650 ViX may insecurely load Dynamic Link Libraries

## Overview

ViX provided by ï¼«ï¼¿ï¼¯ï¼«ï¼¡ï¼¤ï¼¡ may insecurely load Dynamic Link Libraries.

## Vendor Information

Developer: ï¼«ï¼¿ï¼¯ï¼«ï¼¡ï¼¤ï¼¡

Product name and version: ViX version 2.21.148.0

## Description

ViX provided by ï¼«ï¼¿ï¼¯ï¼«ï¼¡ï¼¤ï¼¡ is a Graphics Viewer Software for Windows. ViX contains an issue with the DLL search path, which may lead to insecurely loading Dynamic Link Libraries contained in the same directory as an image file ([CWE-427](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html)).

## Impact

Arbitrary code may be executed with the privileges of the running application.

## Solution

**Consider stop using ViX version 2.21.148.0**

Since the developer was unreachable, existence of any mitigations are unknown.

## Vendor Opinion

None provided

## JPCERT/CC Addendum

During the meeting of Committee for authorizing the disclosure of unresolved vulnerabilities held on December 5, 2017, it was judged that an advisory for this vulnerability  shall be disclosed since all the criteria and conditions described below which are stated in [Standards for Handling Vulnerability related Information of Software Products and Others](http://www.meti.go.jp/policy/netsecurity/vul_notification.pdf) and [Information Security Early Warning Partnership Guideline](https://www.ipa.go.jp/files/000044732.pdf) have been satisfied.

1. The developer of the product is unreachable

   JPCERT/CC had tried to reach the developer for a period of time (more than 6 months) however there were no responses from the developer.  Therefore the committee reached the conclusion that it is reasonable and appropriate to judge the developer is unreachable.

   - No response to 5 separate emails (sent from January 19, 2011 to September 10, 2011)

   - No response to disclosure of the developer’s name (listed on September 26, 2011) and product name and its version (listed on December 16, 2011) in “[List of unreachable developers](http://jvn.jp/en/reply/index.html)” page on JVN.

   - No response to Announcement of screening procedure for vulnerability disclosure (sent on November 6, 2017)
2. Existence of vulnerability has been verified

   It was verified that the product contains a DLL preloading vulnerability by IPA.  Arbitrary code execution was confirmed which violates the "Confidentiality", "Integrity", and "Availability"of the product.  For verification details, refer to the “Verification” section.
3. Not disclosing this case may result in the risk that product users will have no means to know of the existence of the vulnerability in the product

   By checking the developer’s website, it is assumed that users are permitted to copy, revise, or distribute the product, and it is downloadable via internet. Therefore, the developer cannot directly contact all users of this product to notify of the DLL preloading vulnerability.  It was determined that disclosure of this vulnerability is legitimate under these conditions.
4. There are no particular reasons that would make disclosure inappropriate

   After considering the developer’s stance and the risk to product users, the committee has judged that there are no particular reasons that would make disclosure inappropriate or that disclosure may cause any other issues.
