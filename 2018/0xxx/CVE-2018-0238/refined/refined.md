Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-0238:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from improper user authentication checks within the role-based resource checking functionality of Cisco UCS Director. Specifically, the system fails to properly validate user roles and permissions when accessing virtual machines in the end-user portal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Authentication:** The core issue is the lack of proper user authentication checks, allowing an attacker to bypass intended access controls.
- **Authorization Bypass:** Due to the authentication flaw, an authenticated user can gain unauthorized access to resources (virtual machines) that they should not be able to see or manage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can view unauthorized information related to all virtual machines in the UCS Director end-user portal, including those from other tenants in Service Provider Feature mode.
- **Unauthorized Actions:** An attacker can perform any operations permitted on any virtual machine, which are configured for the end user. These actions are based on the end user self-service policy for the Virtual Data Center (VDC) or the VM Management Actions configured for the user's role.
- **Tenant Data Exposure:** In Service Provider Feature mode, the vulnerability allows viewing virtual machines of other tenants, leading to broader data exposure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploit:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.
- **Web Interface (GUI):** The vulnerability is exploitable through the web interface, while the REST API is not affected.
- **Modified Username Login:** The attacker logs into the UCS Director with a modified username but a valid password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the affected Cisco UCS Director system, using either locally authenticated or LDAP-authenticated accounts.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs remote network access to the UCS Director web interface.

**Affected Products:**
- Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) Director releases 6.0 and 6.5 prior to patch 3.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
- There are no workarounds available.
- A patch (6.5.0.3) is available to fix the vulnerability
