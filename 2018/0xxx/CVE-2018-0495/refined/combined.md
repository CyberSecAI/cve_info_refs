It was discovered that NSS incorrectly handled certain v2-compatible

ClientHello messages. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to

perform a replay attack. ([CVE-2018-12384](/security/CVE-2018-12384))

It was discovered that NSS incorrectly handled certain padding oracles. A

remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a variant of the

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

```
Hi!

The GnuPG Project is pleased to announce the availability of Libgcrypt
versions 1.8.3 and 1.7.10.  These releases mitigate a novel side-channel
attack on ECDSA signatures and also bring fixes for a few other bugs.

Libgcrypt is a general purpose library of cryptographic building blocks.
It is originally based on code used by GnuPG.  It does not provide any
implementation of OpenPGP or other protocols.  Thorough understanding of
applied cryptography is required to use Libgcrypt.

Noteworthy changes in version 1.8.3
===================================

   - Use blinding for ECDSA signing to mitigate a novel side-channel
     attack.  [#4011,CVE-2018-0495]

   - Fix incorrect counter overflow handling for GCM when using an IV
     size other than 96 bit.  [#3764]

   - Fix incorrect output of AES-keywrap mode for in-place encryption
     on some platforms.

   - Fix the gcry_mpi_ec_curve_point point validation function.

   - Fix rare assertion failure in gcry_prime_check.

   Release info at <<https://dev.gnupg.org/T4016>>.

We also released a new version of the older 1.7 branch with similar
fixes.

Comments on the attack
======================

Details on CVE-2018-0495 can be found in the paper "Return of the Hidden
Number Problem" which can be downloaded from the advisory page
<<https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/our-research/technical-advisory-return-of-the-hidden-number-problem/>>.
See <<https://dev.gnupg.org/T4011>> for a timeline.

One user of Libgcrypt is GnuPG, thus a quick comment: GnuPG does not use
the vulenrable ECDSA signatures by default.  Further, it is much harder
to mount such an attack against an offline protocol like OpenPGP than
against online protocols like TLS.  Anyway, we also released a new
Windows installer for GnuPG 2.2.8 featuring the fixed Libgcrypt version.
That installer is linked from the usual download page and a new Gpg4win
version will be released soon.

Download
========

Source code is hosted at the GnuPG FTP server and its mirrors as listed
at <<https://gnupg.org/download/mirrors.html>>.  On the primary server
the source tarball and its digital signature are:

 <https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.8.3.tar.bz2>
 <https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.8.3.tar.bz2.sig>

or gzip compressed:

 <https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.8.3.tar.gz>
 <https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.8.3.tar.gz.sig>

The URLs for the older 1.7 branch are:

 <https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.7.10.tar.bz2>
 <https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.7.10.tar.bz2.sig>
 <https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.7.10.tar.gz>
 <https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.7.10.tar.gz.sig>

In order to check that the version of Libgcrypt you downloaded is an
original and unmodified file please follow the instructions found at
<<https://gnupg.org/download/integrity_check.html>>.  In short, you may
use one of the following methods:

 - Check the supplied OpenPGP signature.  For example to check the
   signature of the file libgcrypt-1.8.3.tar.bz2 you would use this
   command:

     gpg --verify libgcrypt-1.8.3.tar.bz2.sig libgcrypt-1.8.3.tar.bz2

   This checks whether the signature file matches the source file.
   You should see a message indicating that the signature is good and
   made by one or more of the release signing keys.  Make sure that
   this is a valid key, either by matching the shown fingerprint
   against a trustworthy list of valid release signing keys or by
   checking that the key has been signed by trustworthy other keys.
   See the end of this mail for information on the signing keys.

 - If you are not able to use an existing version of GnuPG, you have
   to verify the SHA-1 checksum.  On Unix systems the command to do
   this is either "sha1sum" or "shasum".  Assuming you downloaded the
   file libgcrypt-1.8.3.tar.bz2, you run the command like this:

     sha1sum libgcrypt-1.8.3.tar.bz2

   and check that the output matches the first line from the
   this list:

13bd2ce69e59ab538e959911dfae80ea309636e3  libgcrypt-1.8.3.tar.bz2
3b4d23db99ef13e6e305f536f009d9de8f5d0535  libgcrypt-1.8.3.tar.gz
66902603f7b6ad62c72db868d93b1772ac2a1afa  libgcrypt-1.7.10.tar.bz2
a0aaea0c514c62de8533a955631134bc57f2e552  libgcrypt-1.7.10.tar.gz

   You should also verify that the checksums above are authentic by
   matching them with copies of this announcement.  Those copies can be
   found at other mailing lists, web sites, and search engines.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

Non-Unix systems are not affected.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1694980#c1)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-04-02 08:37:23 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html#CVE-2019-0211> <http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/CHANGES_2.4>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1694980#c2)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-04-02 08:39:22 UTC  ``` Created httpd tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1694986](show_bug.cgi?id=1694986 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-0211 httpd: privilege escalation from modules scripts [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1694980#c3)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2019-04-03 05:09:58 UTC  ``` Details about possible exploitation scenario:  When you have an environment in which un-trusted script authors are allowed to upload arbitrary scripts (like PHP, CGI etc), These scripts normally run with restricted (non-root) privileges, but this flaw could allow the attacker to raise privilege to root and be able to run arbitrary code on the web server as root. Such setup is common for example in the case of shared hosting etc.   <https://twitter.com/iamamoose/status/1112966189276389376>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1694980#c7)  Joe Orton    2019-04-03 09:34:01 UTC  ``` Upstream 2.4.x fix is:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1855378>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1694980#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2019-04-04 10:54:15 UTC  ``` This issue got named CARPE (DIEM).

I have opened a case with Red Hat support.  If I receive an answer, will I be allowed to share that information here?   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1694980#c21)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2019-04-11 04:30:00 UTC  ``` Note on CVSS3 rating of this flaw: ================================= The attack is basically carried out by uploading a script on a vulnerable web server which is configured to allow upload and execution of such vulnerable scripts. Due to this flaw, instead of the script running under a restricted privilege user, it can run as root and therefore allow privilege escalation on the web server. This can allow the attacker to run code as root on the web server and depending on other configurations could effectively allow the attacker to take its control.  Therefore: Attack Vector: Local (Attack is carried out through a local app vuln.) Attack Complexity: Low (Vuln can be exploited at any time, as long at the vuln application exists) Privileges Required: Low (Common for shared hosting configurations) User Interaction: None (exploit can run without any other user doing an action on the script, again common in shared hosting conf, where this vuln would manifest itself) Scope: Changed (This impacts the OS, beyond the exploitable web server) CIA:H (This is due to privilege escalation)   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1694980#c23)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-04-11 11:57:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 EUS  Via RHSA-2019:0746 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0746](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0746)   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1694980#c24)  James Boyle    2019-04-11 18:16:37 UTC  ``` Thank you!   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1694980#c25)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2019-04-12 04:27:07 UTC  ``` Statement:  This flaw is exploitable in httpd if it is configured to allow an untrusted user to upload and execute arbitrary scripts.  Due to the nature of the flaw, the uploaded script would not run as a restricted privileged user, but rather it runs as root allowing for privilege escalation from the restricted user to root on the web server.    Depending on the configuration of the server, you would need local (AV:L) privileges to place the script or network (AV:N) privileges if the server ran an application that permitted uploading scripts directly.  The latter scenario is not common for unauthenticated users.  Once the attacker can place the script somewhere in the web root where it can be easily exploited (AC:L).  This type of setup is more common in shared hosted environments (PR:L) and would allow an attacker with access to a site on the shared hosted to impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA:H) with no interaction (UI:N).  Due to the elevated privileges obtained, there is an impact to the system beyond the web server itself (S:C).   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=1694980#c27)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-05-07 04:19:47 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2019:0980 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0980](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0980)   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1694980#c28)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-05-30 14:48:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.29 SP2  Via RHSA-2019:1296 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1296](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1296)   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=1694980#c29)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-05-30 14:57:17 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBoss Core Services on RHEL 7   JBoss Core Services on RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2019:1297 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1297](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1297)   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=1694980#c30)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-06-18 19:08:57 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBoss Core Services Apache HTTP Server 2.4.29 SP2  Via RHSA-2019:1543 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1543](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1543)   ``` |  |

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

# USN-3692-1: OpenSSL vulnerabilities

26 June 2018

Several security issues were fixed in OpenSSL.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [openssl](/security/cves?package=openssl) - Secure Socket Layer (SSL) cryptographic library and tools
* [openssl1.0](/security/cves?package=openssl1.0) - Secure Socket Layer (SSL) cryptographic library and tools

## Details

Keegan Ryan discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled ECDSA key

generation. An attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a

cache-timing attack and recover private ECDSA keys. ([CVE-2018-0495](/security/CVE-2018-0495))

Guido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled very large prime

values during a key agreement. A remote attacker could possibly use this

issue to consume resources, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-0732](/security/CVE-2018-0732))

Alejandro Cabrera Aldaya, Billy Brumley, Cesar Pereida Garcia and Luis

Manuel Alvarez Tapia discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled RSA key

generation. An attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a

cache-timing attack and recover private RSA keys. ([CVE-2018-0737](/security/CVE-2018-0737))

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Comment 65](show_bug.cgi?id=1639873#c65)  Bob Relyea    2019-01-24 07:43:57 UTC  ``` Doh, those are the log files. The identified error is correct. I thought I had tested the builds before I sent them, but I don't see the garbage names in my /var/tmp, so I must have missed something. I'll get new builds out shortly.  bob   ```  [Comment 81](show_bug.cgi?id=1639873#c81)  Simo Sorce    2019-02-11 15:41:05 UTC  ``` This issue was not selected to be included either in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.7 because it is seen either as low or moderate impact to a small amount of use-cases. The next release will be in Maintenance Support 1 Phase, which means that qualified Critical and Important Security errata advisories (RHSAs) and Urgent Priority Bug Fix errata advisories (RHBAs) may be released as they become available. We will now close this issue, but if you believe that it qualifies for the Maintenance Support 1 Phase, please re-open; otherwise we recommend moving the request to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 if applicable.   ```  [Comment 96](show_bug.cgi?id=1639873#c96)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-06 13:08:28 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.  For information on the advisory, and where to find the updated files, follow the link below.  If the solution does not work for you, open a new bug report.

I just noticed, that a tag for Libgcrypt 1.8.3 seems to be missing: <https://dev.gnupg.org/source/libgcrypt/tags/LIBGCRYPT-1.8-BRANCH/>

Furthermore the NEWS entries for v1.8.3 \*and\* v1.8.2 seem to be missing in master: <https://dev.gnupg.org/source/libgcrypt/browse/master/NEWS>

But in branch-1.8 the NEWS file does contain an entry for v1.8.2, only one for v1.8.3 is lacking: <https://dev.gnupg.org/source/libgcrypt/browse/LIBGCRYPT-1.8-BRANCH/NEWS>

Oh, and the README still refers to v1.7 in master \*and\* branch-1.8: <https://dev.gnupg.org/source/libgcrypt/browse/master/README>

HTH

P.S.: As usual, my quest for proper references in the WWW WRT Libgcrypt releases originates from housekeeping of <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libgcrypt>

P.P.S.: Maintenance of the branch-1.7 has stopped 2018-06-01, right (\*edit:\* or was that planned to happen 2018-06-31)?

1.8.3 has not yet been released and thus there is no NEWS entries and there can't be a 1.8.3 tag. You are right that the README still says 1.7. I'll fix that for 1.8.3. Why do you think maintenance of 1.7 stopped; the AUTHORS file and the new EOL statements on the download page say that we are going to maintain it until 2019-06-30.

Thanks.

So what I remembered was 1 year and 1 month off the real EOL date.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1591163#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2018-06-14 08:05:05 UTC  ```  An implementation flaw was discovered in multiple cryptographic libraries that allows a side-channel based attacker to recover ECDSA or DSA private keys. When these cryptographic libraries use the private key to create a signature, such as for a TLS or SSH connection, they inadvertently leak information through memory caches. An unprivileged attacker running on the same machine can collect the information from a few thousand signatures and recover the value of the private key.

However the [CVE-2018-0495](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-0495) issue does not apply to Bouncycastle, thus it is considered "not affected" by this flaw.  Bouncycastle inherently relies upon Java BigInteger arithmetic, which is not constant-time by design, so other countermeasures are needed to mitigate timing/side channel attacks.  In RSA operations, Bouncycastle uses blinding (ref [CVE-2016-1000341](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-1000341)).  Since 1.59, EC operations use a table lookup to prevent information leaks through similar channels.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1591163#c16)  Huzaifa S.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [openssl](/security/cves?package=openssl) - Secure Socket Layer (SSL) cryptographic library and tools

## Details

USN-3692-1 fixed a vulnerability in OpenSSL. This update provides

the corresponding update for Ubuntu 12.04 ESM.

Original advisory details:

Keegan Ryan discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled ECDSA key

generation. An attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a

cache-timing attack and recover private ECDSA keys. ([CVE-2018-0495](/security/CVE-2018-0495))

Guido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled very large prime

values during a key agreement. A remote attacker could possibly use this

issue to consume resources, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-0732](/security/CVE-2018-0732))

Alejandro Cabrera Aldaya, Billy Brumley, Cesar Pereida Garcia and Luis

Manuel Alvarez Tapia discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled RSA key

generation. An attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a

cache-timing attack and recover private RSA keys. ([CVE-2018-0737](/security/CVE-2018-0737))

When are those going to be fixed?](#cve-severity-assessment)- [What does local (remote) mean?](#localremote)

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.
