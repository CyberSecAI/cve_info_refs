{
  "CVE-2018-0495": {
    "description": "A memory-cache side-channel attack on ECDSA signatures vulnerability exists. This allows a local attacker to recover ECDSA private keys.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the fact that libgcrypt does not properly use blinding when generating ECDSA signatures, leading to memory-cache side-channel attacks.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Memory-cache side-channel attack",
       "Lack of blinding during ECDSA signature generation"
    ],
    "impact": "Exposure of sensitive information, specifically recovery of ECDSA private keys.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Local attacker"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be local, i.e. have the ability to run unprivileged code on the same machine as the vulnerable application.",
        "affected_components":[
          "libgcrypt",
          "openssl",
          "nss"
