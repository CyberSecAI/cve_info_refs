- **No User Interaction:** No interaction from another user is needed to trigger the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must be a user of the Cybozu Office application with the ability to log in.
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Cybozu Office instance.
