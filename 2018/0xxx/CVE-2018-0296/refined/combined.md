It is also possible on certain software releases that the ASA will not reload, but an attacker could view sensitive system information without authentication by using directory traversal techniques.  **Note:** Cisco continues to strongly recommend that customers upgrade to a fixed Cisco ASA Software release to remediate this vulnerability as there are continued attempts to exploit in the wild.      This advisory is available at the following link:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180606-asaftd>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThis vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software that is running on the following Cisco products:   + 3000 Series Industrial Security Appliance (ISA)   + ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall   + ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances   + ASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls   + ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers   + Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv)   + Firepower 2100 Series Security Appliance   + Firepower 4100 Series Security Appliance   + Firepower 9300 ASA Security Module   + FTD Virtual (FTDv)**ASA Software**      In the following table, the left column lists the Cisco ASA features that are potentially vulnerable. The right column indicates the basic configuration for the feature from the **show running-config** CLI command, if it can be determined. If the device is configured for one of these features, follow the additional instructions to determine if the device is vulnerable.      | Cisco ASA Feature | Possible Vulnerable Configuration |   | --- | --- |   | Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM)1 | http server enable  http |   | AnyConnect IKEv2 Remote Access (with client services) | crypto ikev2 enable  client-services port  webvpn anyconnect enable |   | AnyConnect IKEv2 Remote Access (without client services) | crypto ikev2 enable  webvpn anyconnect enable |   | AnyConnect SSL VPN | webvpn enable |   | Cisco Security Manager2 | http server enable  http |   | Clientless SSL VPN | webvpn enable |   | Cut-Through Proxy (Not vulnerable unless used in conjunction with other vulnerable features on the same port) | aaa authentication listener  port |   | Local Certificate Authority (CA) | crypto ca server no shutdown |   | Mobile Device Manager (MDM) Proxy3 | mdm-proxy enable |   | Mobile User Security (MUS) | webvpn mus password  mus server enable port  mus |   | Proxy Bypass | webvpn  proxy-bypass |   | REST API4 | rest-api image disk0:/ rest-api agent |       1ASDM is vulnerable only from an IP address in the configured **http** command range.   2 Cisco Security Manager is vulnerable only from an IP address in the configured **http** command range.   3The MDM Proxy is first supported as of Cisco ASA Software Release 9.3.1.   4The REST API is first supported as of Cisco ASA Software Release 9.3.2. The REST API is vulnerable only from an IP address in the configured **http** command range.      **Determining Whether an ASA Configured with a Potentially Vulnerable Feature Is Vulnerable**      **Step 1:** Administrators can use the **show asp table socket | include SSL|DTLS** command and look for a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or a Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) listen socket on any TCP port. If either socket is present in the output and the ASA device is configured for one or more of the ASA features in the preceding table, the device may be vulnerable. The following example shows an ASA device with SSL and DTLS listen sockets:  ```   ciscoasa# show asp table socket | include SSL|DTLS   ```  ```   SSL       00185038  LISTEN     172.16.0.250:443    0.0.0.0:*SSL       00188638  LISTEN     10.0.0.250:443      0.0.0.0:*DTLS      0018f7a8  LISTEN     10.0.0.250:443      0.0.0.0:*       ``` **Step 2:** Administrators can then use the **show processes | include Unicorn** command to see if the vulnerable process is running on the device. This means that one of the possible vulnerable features has created an instance of the internal web server, which is vulnerable. If **Unicorn Proxy Thread** is present, the device is considered vulnerable. ```   ciscoasa# show processes | include Unicorn   ```  ```   Mwe 0x0000557f9f5bafc0 0x00007f62de5a90a8 0x0000557fa52b50a0       3632 0x00007f62c8c87030 30704/32768 Unicorn Proxy Thread 218   ``` **Note:** The *Unicorn Proxy Thread* identifier in the preceding example is *218*and can vary. A device must be considered vulnerable if the *Unicorn Proxy Thread* process is running, regardless of the actual thread identifier number.   **Determining the Running ASA Software Release**      To determine whether a vulnerable release of Cisco ASA Software is running on a device, administrators can use the **show version | include Version** command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.2(1): ```   ciscoasa# show version | include Version   ```  ```   Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.2(1)Device Manager Version 7.4(1)   ``` Administrators who use Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to manage devices can locate the software release in the table that appears in the login window or the upper-left corner of the Cisco ASDM window.      **FTD Software**      This vulnerability applies to all Cisco FTD Software releases except Release 6.2.0, which is not vulnerable. See the [Fixed Releases](#fs) section for additional information about fixed releases of Cisco FTD Software. The Cisco FTD Software release contains both Firepower and ASA code. Review the “Firepower Threat Defense Devices” section of the [Cisco Firepower Compatibility Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/compatibility/firepower-compatibility.html#reference_070E1908889545BDB6CC564676202628) for additional information.      In the following table, the left column lists the Cisco FTD features   that are potentially vulnerable. The right column indicates the basic   configuration for the feature from the **show running-config** CLI command,   if it can be determined. If the device is configured for one of these   features, follow the additional instructions to determine if   the device is vulnerable.      | Cisco FTD Feature | Vulnerable Configuration |   | --- | --- |   | HTTP Service enabled1 | http server enable  http |   | AnyConnect IKEv2 Remote Access (with client services)2,3 | crypto ikev2 enable  client-services port   webvpn anyconnect enable |   | AnyConnect IKEv2 Remote Access (without client services)2,3 | crypto ikev2 enable  webvpn anyconnect enable |   | AnyConnect SSL VPN2,3 | webvpn enable |       1 The HTTP feature is enabled via **Firepower Threat Defense Platform Settings > HTTP** in the Cisco Firepower Management Console (FMC).   2 Remote Access VPN features are enabled via **Devices > VPN > Remote Access** in the Cisco FMC or via **Device > Remote Access VPN** in Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM).   3 Remote Access VPN features are first supported as of Cisco FTD Software Release 6.2.2.      ******Determining Whether Cisco FTD Configured with a Potentially Vulnerable Feature Is Vulnerable******      **Step 1:** Administrators can use the ****show asp table socket | include SSL|DTLS**** command and   look for an SSL or a DTLS listen socket on any TCP port. If either   socket is present in the output and the FTD device is configured for one   or more of the features listed in the preceding table, the device may be vulnerable. The following example shows an FTD device with   SSL and DTLS listen sockets:  ```   firepower# show asp table socket | include SSL|DTLS   ```  ```   SSL       01ffb648  LISTEN     1.1.1.1:443         0.0.0.0:* DTLS      00009438  LISTEN     1.1.1.1:443         0.0.0.0:*      ```   **Step 2:** Administrators can then use the **show processes | include Unicorn** command to see if the vulnerable process is running on the device. This means that one of the possible vulnerable features has created an instance of the internal web server, which is vulnerable. If **Unicorn Proxy Thread** is present, the device is considered vulnerable. ```   firepower# show processes | include Unicorn   ```  ```   Mwe 0x0000557f9f5bafc0 0x00007f62de5a90a8 0x0000557fa52b50a0       3632 0x00007f62c8c87030 30704/32768 Unicorn Proxy Thread 218   ```  ****Notes:****    + The *Unicorn Proxy Thread* identifier in the previous example is *218* and     can vary. A device must be considered vulnerable if the *Unicorn Proxy     Thread* process is running, regardless of the actual thread identifier     number.   + Although certain IKEv2 feature sets do not enable the underlying SSL TCP listening socket, they may still be vulnerable. Administrators can use the **show running-config crypto ikev2** CLI command to check if the **crypto ikev2 enable** configuration command is present in the configuration, as shown in the following example: ```     firepower# show running-config crypto ikev2 | include enable     ```  ```     crypto ikev2 enable Outside     ``` If a command like **crypto ikev2 enable** is present in the running configuration and the **anyconnect enable** command is part of the global **webvpn** configuration, the Cisco FTD device is also considered vulnerable.   **Determining the Running Cisco FTD Software Release**      Administrators can use the **show version** command in the CLI to determine the Cisco FTD Software release. In this example, the device is running Release 6.2.2: ```   > show version   ```  ```   ---------------------[ ftd ]---------------------Model : Cisco ASA5525-X Threat Defense (75) Version 6.2.2 (Build 362)UUID : 2849ba3c-ecb8-11e6-98ca-b9fc2975893cRules update version : 2017-03-15-001-vrtVDB version : 279----------------------------------------------------   ``` Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.

"text": "A vulnerability in the web interface of the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. It is also possible on certain software releases that the ASA will not reload, but an attacker could view sensitive system information without authentication by using directory traversal techniques.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to lack of proper input validation of the HTTP URL. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition or unauthenticated disclosure of information. This vulnerability applies to IPv4 and IPv6 HTTP traffic.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nNote: Cisco continues to strongly recommend that customers upgrade to a fixed Cisco ASA Software release to remediate this vulnerability as there are continued attempts to exploit in the wild.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180606-asaftd [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180606-asaftd\"]"

"text": "This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software that is running on the following Cisco products:\r\n\r\n3000 Series Industrial Security Appliance (ISA)\r\nASA 1000V Cloud Firewall\r\nASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances\r\nASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls\r\nASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers\r\nAdaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv)\r\nFirepower 2100 Series Security Appliance\r\nFirepower 4100 Series Security Appliance\r\nFirepower 9300 ASA Security Module\r\nFTD Virtual (FTDv)\r\n ASA Software\r\n\r\nIn the following table, the left column lists the Cisco ASA features that are potentially vulnerable. The right column indicates the basic configuration for the feature from the show running-config CLI command, if it can be determined. If the device is configured for one of these features, follow the additional instructions to determine if the device is vulnerable.\r\n\r\n Cisco ASA Feature Possible Vulnerable Configuration Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM)1 http server enable \r\nhttp    AnyConnect IKEv2 Remote Access (with client services) crypto ikev2 enable  client-services port \r\nwebvpn\r\n anyconnect enable\r\n AnyConnect IKEv2 Remote Access (without client services) crypto ikev2 enable \r\nwebvpn\r\n anyconnect enable\r\n AnyConnect SSL VPN webvpn\r\n enable  Cisco Security Manager2 http server enable \r\nhttp   \r\n Clientless SSL VPN webvpn\r\n enable  Cut-Through Proxy (Not vulnerable unless used in conjunction with other vulnerable features on the same port) aaa authentication listener  port \r\n Local Certificate Authority (CA) crypto ca server\r\n no shutdown\r\n Mobile Device Manager (MDM) Proxy3 mdm-proxy\r\n enable  Mobile User Security (MUS) webvpn\r\n mus password \r\n mus server enable port \r\n mus    Proxy Bypass\r\n webvpn\r\n proxy-bypass\r\n REST API4 rest-api image disk0:/\r\nrest-api agent\r\n\r\n1ASDM is vulnerable only from an IP address in the configured http command range.\r\n2 Cisco Security Manager is vulnerable only from an IP address in the configured http command range.\r\n3The MDM Proxy is first supported as of Cisco ASA Software Release 9.3.1.\r\n4The REST API is first supported as of Cisco ASA Software Release 9.3.2. The REST API is vulnerable only from an IP address in the configured http command range.\r\n\r\nDetermining Whether an ASA Configured with a Potentially Vulnerable Feature Is Vulnerable\r\n\r\nStep 1: Administrators can use the show asp table socket | include SSL|DTLS command and look for a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or a Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) listen socket on any TCP port. If either socket is present in the output and the ASA device is configured for one or more of the ASA features in the preceding table, the device may be vulnerable. The following example shows an ASA device with SSL and DTLS listen sockets:\r\n\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show asp table socket | include SSL|DTLS\r\n\r\n\r\nSSL 00185038 LISTEN 172.16.0.250:443 0.0.0.0:\*\r\nSSL 00188638 LISTEN 10.0.0.250:443 0.0.0.0:\*\r\nDTLS 0018f7a8 LISTEN 10.0.0.250:443 0.0.0.0:\*\r\n Step 2: Administrators can then use the show processes | include Unicorn command to see if the vulnerable process is running on the device. This means that one of the possible vulnerable features has created an instance of the internal web server, which is vulnerable. If Unicorn Proxy Thread is present, the device is considered vulnerable.\r\n\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show processes | include Unicorn\r\n\r\n\r\nMwe 0x0000557f9f5bafc0 0x00007f62de5a90a8 0x0000557fa52b50a0 3632 0x00007f62c8c87030 30704/32768 Unicorn Proxy Thread 218\r\n Note: The Unicorn Proxy Thread identifier in the preceding example is 218 and can vary. A device must be considered vulnerable if the Unicorn Proxy Thread process is running, regardless of the actual thread identifier number.\r\n\r\nDetermining the Running ASA Software Release\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a vulnerable release of Cisco ASA Software is running on a device, administrators can use the show version | include Version command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.2(1):\r\nciscoasa# show version | include Version\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.2(1)\r\nDevice Manager Version 7.4(1)\r\n Administrators who use Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to manage devices can locate the software release in the table that appears in the login window or the upper-left corner of the Cisco ASDM window.\r\n\r\nFTD Software\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability applies to all Cisco FTD Software releases except Release 6.2.0, which is not vulnerable. See the Fixed Releases [\"#fs\"] section for additional information about fixed releases of Cisco FTD Software. The Cisco FTD Software release contains both Firepower and ASA code. Review the ���Firepower Threat Defense Devices��� section of the Cisco Firepower Compatibility Guide [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/compatibility/firepower-compatibility.html#reference\_070E1908889545BDB6CC564676202628\"] for additional information.\r\n\r\nIn the following table, the left column lists the Cisco FTD features that are potentially vulnerable. The right column indicates the basic configuration for the feature from the show running-config CLI command, if it can be determined. If the device is configured for one of these features, follow the additional instructions to determine if the device is vulnerable.\r\n\r\n Cisco FTD Feature Vulnerable Configuration HTTP Service enabled1 http server enable \r\nhttp   \r\n AnyConnect IKEv2 Remote Access (with client services)2,3 crypto ikev2 enable  client-services port \r\nwebvpn\r\n anyconnect enable AnyConnect IKEv2 Remote Access (without client services)2,3 crypto ikev2 enable \r\nwebvpn\r\n anyconnect enable AnyConnect SSL VPN2,3 webvpn\r\n enable \r\n1 The HTTP feature is enabled via Firepower Threat Defense Platform Settings > HTTP in the Cisco Firepower Management Console (FMC).\r\n2 Remote Access VPN features are enabled via Devices > VPN > Remote Access in the Cisco FMC or via Device > Remote Access VPN in Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM).\r\n3 Remote Access VPN features are first supported as of Cisco FTD Software Release 6.2.2.\r\n\r\nDetermining Whether Cisco FTD Configured with a Potentially Vulnerable Feature Is Vulnerable\r\n\r\nStep 1: Administrators can use the show asp table socket | include SSL|DTLS command and look for an SSL or a DTLS listen socket on any TCP port. If either socket is present in the output and the FTD device is configured for one or more of the features listed in the preceding table, the device may be vulnerable. The following example shows an FTD device with SSL and DTLS listen sockets:\r\n\r\n\r\nfirepower# show asp table socket | include SSL|DTLS\r\n\r\n\r\nSSL 01ffb648 LISTEN 1.1.1.1:443 0.0.0.0:\*\r\nDTLS 00009438 LISTEN 1.1.1.1:443 0.0.0.0:\*\r\n\r\n Step 2: Administrators can then use the show processes | include Unicorn command to see if the vulnerable process is running on the device. This means that one of the possible vulnerable features has created an instance of the internal web server, which is vulnerable. If Unicorn Proxy Thread is present, the device is considered vulnerable.\r\n\r\n\r\nfirepower# show processes | include Unicorn\r\n\r\n\r\nMwe 0x0000557f9f5bafc0 0x00007f62de5a90a8 0x0000557fa52b50a0 3632 0x00007f62c8c87030 30704/32768 Unicorn Proxy Thread 218\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nThe Unicorn Proxy Thread identifier in the previous example is 218 and can vary. A device must be considered vulnerable if the Unicorn Proxy Thread process is running, regardless of the actual thread identifier number.\r\nAlthough certain IKEv2 feature sets do not enable the underlying SSL TCP listening socket, they may still be vulnerable. Administrators can use the show running-config crypto ikev2 CLI command to check if the crypto ikev2 enable configuration command is present in the configuration, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\nfirepower# show running-config crypto ikev2 | include enable\r\n\r\n\r\ncrypto ikev2 enable Outside\r\n If a command like crypto ikev2 enable is present in the running configuration and the anyconnect enable command is part of the global webvpn configuration, the Cisco FTD device is also considered vulnerable.\r\nDetermining the Running Cisco FTD Software Release\r\n\r\nAdministrators can use the show version command in the CLI to determine the Cisco FTD Software release. In this example, the device is running Release 6.2.2:\r\n> show version\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------[ ftd ]---------------------\r\nModel : Cisco ASA5525-X Threat Defense (75) Version 6.2.2 (Build 362)\r\nUUID : 2849ba3c-ecb8-11e6-98ca-b9fc2975893c\r\nRules update version : 2017-03-15-001-vrt\r\nVDB version : 279\r\n----------------------------------------------------"

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 8.6 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.6 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 8.6 |

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS-CERT website](/ics/) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

NCCIC also recommends that users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.
* Refer to Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams for more information on avoiding email scams.
* Refer to Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks for more information on social engineering attacks.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
