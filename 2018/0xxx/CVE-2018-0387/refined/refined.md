*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to persuade the user to click the malicious link.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** Cisco Webex Teams for Windows and MacOS.
*   **Unaffected Products:** Cisco Webex Teams for Android and iPhone are not affected.
*   **Workarounds:** There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.
*   **CVSS Score:** Base score of 6.3, indicating a MEDIUM severity.
*   **Exploitation:** At the time of the advisory, there were no known public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability.

**Summary:**

CVE-2018-0387 is a Remote Code Execution vulnerability in Cisco Webex Teams caused by improper input sanitization. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious link to a user and tricking them into clicking it, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's system.
