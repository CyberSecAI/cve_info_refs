Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-0307:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation of command arguments within the Cisco NX-OS Software CLI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the ability to inject malicious command arguments into vulnerable CLI commands. This lack of proper input sanitization allows an attacker to introduce their own commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker, who is already authenticated as a privileged user, to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device with *root* privileges.
- **Cross-VDC Access:** In products supporting multiple virtual device contexts (VDCs), the attacker can leverage this vulnerability to access files from any VDC, which means they can potentially access files beyond their authorized context.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the device to exploit this vulnerability.
- **CLI Interaction:** The attack is performed through the CLI by injecting malicious arguments into a vulnerable command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with privileged access to the device.
- **Local Access:** The attacker must be able to interact with the device's CLI locally.

**Additional Information:**
- There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
- The affected products include various Nexus series switches running vulnerable versions of Cisco NX-OS software.
- The advisory notes that no public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability were known at the time of release.
