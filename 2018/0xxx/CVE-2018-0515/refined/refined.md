- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The installer for "FLET'S Azukeru Backup Tool" has an issue with its DLL search path, leading to insecure loading of Dynamic Link Libraries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure DLL loading.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the installer.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker places a malicious DLL file in a location where the installer will load it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to trick a user into placing a malicious DLL in a specific folder that the installer searches. The user then needs to run the vulnerable installer.
