Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-0289:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from improper validation of requests that are stored in the logs within the application management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is the susceptibility to cross-site scripting attacks due to the lack of proper input sanitization of logged requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **XSS Attacks:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the logs. When an administrator views these logs, the injected script executes within their browser, potentially leading to various impacts:
    -  Session hijacking
    -  Credential theft
    -  Defacement of web pages
    -  Redirection to malicious sites
    -  Unauthorized actions on the administrator's behalf.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely by an unauthenticated attacker.
- **Malicious Requests:** The attacker sends specially crafted malicious requests to the targeted system that will be logged by the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send requests to the vulnerable Cisco ISE system.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need valid credentials or an existing account to exploit the vulnerability.
- **User Interaction:** The exploitation requires an administrator to view the logs containing the malicious requests, triggering the execution of the injected script (User interaction: Required).

**Additional Notes:**
- **No Workarounds:** Cisco has stated that there are no workarounds available to mitigate this vulnerability.
- **Fixed Software:** Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.
- **Internal Discovery:** The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing by Cisco.

**CVSS Score:**
The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 6.1, categorized as MEDIUM severity.
