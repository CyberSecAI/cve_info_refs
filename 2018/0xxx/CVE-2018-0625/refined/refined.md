Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Summary:**

The provided documents describe multiple vulnerabilities affecting several Aterm series products by NEC Corporation. These vulnerabilities include OS command injection and buffer overflow issues. The affected products are Aterm WG1200HP, Aterm W300P and Aterm HC100RC.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Improper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input that is used in OS commands.
    *   **Affected Products:** Aterm WG1200HP, Aterm W300P, Aterm HC100RC
    *   **Attack Vector:** Adjacent network access is required.
    *   **Required Privileges:** Administrative privileges.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker with administrative access can execute arbitrary OS commands.
*   **Buffer Overflow (CWE-119):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Insufficient boundary checks when writing data to a buffer, leading to overwrite of adjacent memory.
    *    **Affected Products:** Aterm W300P, Aterm HC100RC
    *   **Attack Vector:** Adjacent network access is required.
    *  **Required Privileges:** Administrative privileges.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker with administrative access can execute arbitrary code.

**Specific CVEs:**

*   **Aterm WG1200HP:**
    *   CVE-2018-0625, CVE-2018-0626, CVE-2018-0627, CVE-2018-0628 (OS Command Injection)
*   **Aterm W300P:**
    *    CVE-2018-0629, CVE-2018-0630, CVE-2018-0631 (OS Command Injection)
    *   CVE-2018-0632, CVE-2018-0633 (Buffer Overflow)
*   **Aterm HC100RC:**
    *   CVE-2018-0634, CVE-2018-0635, CVE-2018-0636, CVE-2018-0637, CVE-2018-0638, CVE-2018-0639 (OS Command Injection)
    *   CVE-2018-0640, CVE-2018-0641 (Buffer Overflow)

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **OS Command Injection:** Allows an attacker with administrative privileges to execute arbitrary OS commands, potentially gaining full control of the device.
*  **Buffer Overflow:** Allows an attacker with administrative privileges to execute arbitrary code, potentially gaining full control of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is adjacent network access, meaning the attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device.
*   The attacker also needs to have valid administrative credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**

*   The attacker must have network access to the device.
*   The attacker must have valid administrative credentials to access the device's management interface.

**Mitigation:**

*   The primary mitigation is to update the firmware of the affected devices to the latest version provided by NEC Corporation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities were reported by Taizoh Tsukamoto of Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc.
*   The vulnerabilities were coordinated by JPCERT/CC with the vendor.
*   The provided documents are more detailed than the provided CVE description.
*   All the documents reference the same vulnerabilities, and only differ on the products affected.
