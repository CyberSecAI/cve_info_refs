Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-0353:

**Root Cause:**
* The vulnerability is due to a change in the underlying operating system software responsible for monitoring traffic on the Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA). This change causes the Layer 4 Traffic Monitor (L4TM) functionality to fail to properly monitor traffic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* The vulnerability lies in the traffic-monitoring functions of the Cisco WSA when configured for L4TM.
* Specifically, the underlying operating system change causes the L4TM to fail allowing traffic to bypass the intended security policies.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass the L4TM functionality.
* This allows the attacker to pass traffic through the device that the WSA was configured to deny, potentially leading to security breaches.
* The vulnerability affects both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.
* Successful exploitation could result in the attacker bypassing security protections.

**Attack Vectors:**
* The attack vector is remote and over the network.
* Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted IP packets to an affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to send IP packets to an affected Cisco WSA.
* No authentication is required.
* The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable WSA.

**Affected Products:**
* Cisco AsyncOS versions for WSA on both virtual and hardware appliances running any release of the 10.5.1, 10.5.2, or 11.0.0 WSA Software.
* The WSA is vulnerable if configured for L4TM.

**Mitigation:**
* Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability.
* There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
* Upgrading to the fixed releases will resolve this issue.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
* Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
* This vulnerability is classified as High severity with a CVSS base score of 7.5.
* The corresponding Bug ID is CSCvg78875.
