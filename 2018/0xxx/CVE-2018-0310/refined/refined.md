Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation within the Cisco Fabric Services component of Cisco FXOS and NX-OS software. Specifically, the software does not properly validate header values in Cisco Fabric Services packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Buffer Overread:** Sending a crafted Cisco Fabric Services packet can trigger a buffer overread condition.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The core weakness lies in the lack of proper validation of header values in received packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can lead to a DoS condition on the affected device.
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** A buffer overread could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information from memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vectors depend on which Cisco Fabric Services distribution types are configured for a device:

- **CFSoFC (Cisco Fabric Services over Fibre Channel):**
  - Attacks can occur via Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) or Fibre Channel over IP (FCIP) if FC ports are configured.
  - The attack is successful in the data plane of any FC port.
  - If no FC ports are configured, this attack vector is not available.
- **CFSoE (Cisco Fabric Services over Ethernet):**
  - Attack possible only from a vPC peer or an attacker with access to a vPC peer link.
- **CFSoIP (Cisco Fabric Services over IP):**
  - Attack possible from any node with IP network connectivity to the management interface of a device.
  - The attack is not successful from the data plane.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Unauthenticated, Remote Attacker:** No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker must be able to reach the device's network interface depending on which CFSoX is used.
- **Network Access:**
    - **CFSoFC:** Access to the data plane of FC ports.
    - **CFSoE:** Access to vPC peer links.
    - **CFSoIP:** IP network connectivity to the management interface.
- **Crafted Packets:** The attacker needs the ability to send crafted Cisco Fabric Services packets to the vulnerable device.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is present in Cisco FXOS Software and Cisco NX-OS Software if the device is configured to use Cisco Fabric Services.
- There are no workarounds to address the vulnerability, a software update is required.
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-399 (Improper Resource Management).
- Cisco has assigned a CVSS base score of 8.6 (HIGH) to this vulnerability.
- Exploitation does not require applications using CFS to be enabled, only that one of the vulnerable distribution types is configured.

The advisory includes details on how to determine if a device is using Cisco Fabric Services and how to find the software version. It also includes tables indicating affected software versions and the first fixed releases for this vulnerability and all vulnerabilities in the June 2018 advisory collection.
