{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The SMB server driver (srv.sys and srv2.sys) does not properly validate the destination of NTFS mount points when handling reparse operations. Specifically, it does not restrict the target device types, unlike the I/O manager, which allows an attacker to redirect the open operation to an arbitrary device.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper validation of NTFS mount points.",
    "Lack of checks on reparse target device types within the SMB server driver.",
    "Ability to open arbitrary devices via an SMB client",
    "The ability to pass an arbitrary EA block, which can be processed by the device create handler."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Local privilege escalation (EoP). An attacker can open an arbitrary device in a system thread and set values such as process ID and session ID, which can be leveraged for malicious purposes.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker needs local access to the target machine to exploit this vulnerability. They must create an NTFS mount point that redirects to a device and then use an SMB client to trigger the vulnerable code path.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires the ability to execute code on the target machine to create an NTFS mount point and use an SMB client. The attacker does not need administrative or kernel-level privileges before exploitation."
