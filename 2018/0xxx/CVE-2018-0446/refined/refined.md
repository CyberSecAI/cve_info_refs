**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient CSRF protection: The web interface lacks proper mechanisms to prevent CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote: The attacker can be remote, not requiring physical access to the device.
- User interaction: Requires persuading a user of the web-based management interface to follow a malicious, customized link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious link.
- The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking the link while the user is logged into the Cisco Industrial Network Director web interface.
- The attacker does not need to authenticate directly to the web interface but relies on the victim's active session.
