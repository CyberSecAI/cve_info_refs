Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-0278:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper cross-origin domain protections for the WebSocket protocol in the management console of Cisco Firepower System Software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The primary weakness is the lack of proper cross-origin domain protection for WebSocket communication within the Firepower System Software management console. This allows an attacker to bypass the same-origin policy.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to:
    - Access sensitive data about the system, including policy or configuration information.
    - Potentially perform further attacks against the management console, using the stolen information.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (remote).
- The attacker needs to convince a user to visit a malicious website. This website is designed to send requests to the vulnerable Firepower management console while the user is logged in, using the user's active session cookie.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website.
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication with the Firepower system.
- The attacker relies on user interaction i.e., the user visiting the malicious website.
- The attacker requires an active user session on the vulnerable system to successfully perform the exploit and retrieve sensitive information.
