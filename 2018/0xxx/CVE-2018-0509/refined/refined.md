Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0509:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the `epg search result viewer(kkcald)` application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- If a logged-in user visits a malicious webpage crafted by an attacker, the attacker can trigger unintended actions on the vulnerable application. This could potentially lead to:
  - Unauthorized modifications of user data.
  - Triggering actions that the user did not intend to perform.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker crafts a malicious webpage containing forged requests.
- The attacker lures a logged-in user of the vulnerable application to visit the malicious webpage (e.g., via a link in an email).
- The user's browser automatically sends the forged requests to the vulnerable application, as the user is already authenticated.
- The vulnerable application processes these requests, believing them to be legitimate, and performs unintended actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage.
- The attacker needs to lure a logged-in user of the vulnerable application to visit the malicious webpage.
- The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated on the target application.
