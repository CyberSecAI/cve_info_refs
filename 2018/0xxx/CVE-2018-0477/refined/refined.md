Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0477:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization of command arguments within the CLI parser of Cisco IOS XE Software. This allows access to internal data structures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection (CWE-77, CWE-78) - The software fails to properly sanitize input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary commands with *root* privileges on the affected device. This could lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is local, meaning the attacker needs to be on the same device, or have access to the device's command line interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs privileged EXEC mode (privilege level 15) access to the affected Cisco IOS XE device.
- They need to be able to execute CLI commands containing custom arguments.

**Summary:**
CVE-2018-0477 describes a command injection vulnerability within the Cisco IOS XE CLI parser. An attacker with privileged access can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands as root, leading to potential system compromise.
