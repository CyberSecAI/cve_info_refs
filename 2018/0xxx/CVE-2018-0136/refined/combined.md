| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 8.6 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.6 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 8.6 |

"text": "A vulnerability in the IPv6 subsystem of Cisco IOS XR Software Release 5.3.4 for the Cisco Aggregation Services Router (ASR) 9000 Series could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of one or more Trident-based line cards, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of IPv6 packets with a fragment header extension. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending IPv6 packets designed to trigger the issue either to or through the Trident-based line card. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a reload of Trident-based line cards, resulting in a DoS during the period of time the line card takes to restart.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n"

"text": "This vulnerability affects Cisco Aggregation Services Router (ASR) 9000 Series when the following conditions are met:\r\n\r\nThe router is running Cisco IOS XR Software Release 5.3.4.\r\nThe router has installed Trident-based line cards that have IPv6 configured.\r\n Determining the Cisco IOS XR Software Release\r\n\r\nTo determine which Cisco IOS XR Software release is running on a device and the name of the device on which it is running, administrators can log in to the device and use the show version command in the CLI. If the device is running Cisco IOS XR Software, Cisco IOS XR Software or similar text appears in the system banner. The location and name of the system image file that is currently running on the device appears next to the System image file is text. The name of the hardware product appears on the line after the name of the system image file.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the show version command on a device that is running Cisco IOS XR Software release 5.3.4:\r\nRP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9001#show version\r\nWed Jan 24 01:32:32.751 EST Cisco IOS XR Software, Version 5.3.4[Default] Copyright (c) 2017 by Cisco Systems, Inc. ROM: System Bootstrap, Version 2.04(20140227:092320) [ASR9K ROMMON], ASR9001 uptime is 6 hours, 17 minutes System image file is \"bootflash:disk0/asr9k-os-mbi-5.3.4.sp4-1.0.0/0x100000/mbiasr9k-rp.vm\" cisco ASR9K Series (P4040) processor with 8388608K bytes of memory. P4040 processor at 1500MHz, Revision 2.0 ASR-9001 Chassis 2 Management Ethernet 8 TenGigE 20 GigabitEthernet 8 DWDM controller(s) 8 WANPHY controller(s) 44 GigabitEthernet/IEEE 802.3 interface(s) 219k bytes of non-volatile configuration memory. 2880M bytes of hard disk. 3932144k bytes of disk0: (Sector size 512 bytes). Configuration register on node 0/RSP0/CPU0 is 0x2102\r\n\r\n\r\nDetermining if the Device Has a Trident-based Line Card\r\n\r\nThe first generation of the Cisco ASR 9000 Series Ethernet line cards are often referred to as Trident-based (or Ethernet) line cards. The term comes from the Network Processors (NPs) that are used on these line cards. The following is a complete list of affected Trident-based line cards. Line cards not listed are not affected by this vulnerability:\r\n\r\nA9K-40GE-L\r\nA9K-40GE-B\r\nA9K-40GE-E\r\nA9K-4T-L\r\nA9K-4T-B\r\nA9K-4T-E\r\nA9K-8T/4-L\r\nA9K-8T/4-B\r\nA9K-8T/4-E\r\nA9K-2T20GE-L\r\nA9K-2T20GE-B\r\nA9K-2T20GE-E\r\nA9K-8T-L\r\nA9K-8T-B\r\nA9K-8T-E\r\nA9K-16/8T-B\r\n To determine whether the line card installed in the ASR 9000 Series Router is Trident-based, the administrator can use the show diag | include PID: command. Affected devices will include the product ID (PID) for at least one of the Trident-based line cards listed previously. The following example shows a device on which an A9K-8T-L card is active:\r\nRP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006-B#show diag | include PID:\r\nTue Jan 26 00:07:09.406 EST PID: A9K-RSP440-SE PID: A9K-RSP440-SE PID: A9K-8X100GE-SE PID: A9K-8T-L PID: A9K-36X10GE-SE PID: A9K-MOD160-TR PID: A9K-MPA-8X10GE PID: A9K-MPA-8X10GE RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006-B#\r\n For more information on Trident-based line cards, consult the ASR 9000 Series Line Card Types publication at the following URL: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/routers/asr-9000-series-aggregation-services-routers/116726-qanda-product-00.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/routers/asr-9000-series-aggregation-services-routers/116726-qanda-product-00.html#anc2\"]\r\n\r\nDetermining if the Device Is Configured for IPv6\r\n\r\nAdministrators can use the show ipv6 interface brief command to determine if an interface is enabled for IPv6 traffic processing. The following example shows an interface configured for IPv6 processing:\r\nRP/0/RP0/CPU0:router# show ipv6 interface brief\r\nGigabitEthernet0/2/0/0 [Up/Up] fe80::212:daff:fe62:c150 202::1 .\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\nThe show ipv6 interface brief command will produce an error message if the running version of Cisco IOS XR Software does not support IPv6. The output will not show any interfaces with IPv6 addresses if IPv6 is disabled.\r\n\r\nAn interface may be configured for IPv6 processing but may not appear on the output of the show ipv6 interface brief command if the interface is part of a bundle or a virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) instance. The show ipv6 vrf all interface command can be used to determine whether any interface has been configured in this way. The following is the output of the show ipv6 vrf all interface command showing an interface configured for IPv6 processing as part of a bundle and assigned to a VRF instance:\r\nRP/0/RP0/CPU0:Router#show ipv6 vrf all interface\r\n.\r\n.\r\n. Bundle-Ether4.765 is Up, ipv6 protocol is Up, Vrfid is FDA (0x60000001) IPv6 is enabled, link-local address is fe80::21d:a2ff:aabb:ccdd Global unicast address(es): 2001:db8:1:1::1, subnet is 2001:db8:1:1::/64 Joined group address(es): ff02::1:ff00:0 ff02::1:aabb:ccdd ff02::2 ff02::1 MTU is 1518 (1500 is available to IPv6) ICMP redirects are disabled ICMP unreachables are enabled ND DAD is enabled, number of DAD attempts 1 ND reachable time is 0 milliseconds ND advertised retransmit interval is 0 milliseconds Hosts use stateless autoconfig for addresses.

Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThis vulnerability affects Cisco Aggregation Services Router (ASR) 9000 Series when the following conditions are met:   + The router is running Cisco IOS XR Software Release 5.3.4.   + The router has installed Trident-based line cards that have IPv6 configured.**Determining the Cisco IOS XR Software Release**      To determine which Cisco IOS XR Software release is running on a device and the name of the device on which it is running, administrators can log in to the device and use the **show version** command in the CLI. If the device is running Cisco IOS XR Software, *Cisco IOS XR Software* or similar text appears in the system banner. The location and name of the system image file that is currently running on the device appears next to the *System image file is* text. The name of the hardware product appears on the line after the name of the system image file.      The following example shows the output of the **show version** command on a device that is running Cisco IOS XR Software release 5.3.4: ```   RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9001#show version   Wed Jan 24 01:32:32.751 EST      Cisco IOS XR Software, Version 5.3.4[Default]   Copyright (c) 2017 by Cisco Systems, Inc.

Configuration register on node 0/RSP0/CPU0 is 0x2102      ```       **Determining if the Device Has a Trident-based Line Card**      The first generation of the Cisco ASR 9000 Series Ethernet line cards are often referred to as Trident-based (or Ethernet) line cards. The term comes from the Network Processors (NPs) that are used on these line cards. The following is a complete list of affected Trident-based line cards. Line cards not listed are not affected by this vulnerability:   + A9K-40GE-L   + A9K-40GE-B   + A9K-40GE-E   + A9K-4T-L   + A9K-4T-B   + A9K-4T-E   + A9K-8T/4-L   + A9K-8T/4-B   + A9K-8T/4-E   + A9K-2T20GE-L   + A9K-2T20GE-B   + A9K-2T20GE-E   + A9K-8T-L   + A9K-8T-B   + A9K-8T-E   + A9K-16/8T-BTo determine whether the line card installed in the ASR 9000 Series Router is Trident-based, the administrator can use the **show diag | include PID:** command. Affected devices will include the product ID (PID) for at least one of the Trident-based line cards listed previously. The following example shows a device on which an A9K-8T-L card is active:    ```   RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006-B#show diag | include PID:   Tue Jan 26 00:07:09.406 EST     PID:   A9K-RSP440-SE     PID:   A9K-RSP440-SE     PID:   A9K-8X100GE-SE     PID:   A9K-8T-L     PID:   A9K-36X10GE-SE     PID:   A9K-MOD160-TR     PID:   A9K-MPA-8X10GE      PID:   A9K-MPA-8X10GE    RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006-B#   ``` For more information on Trident-based line cards, consult the ASR 9000 Series Line Card Types publication at the following URL: [https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/routers/asr-9000-series-aggregation-services-routers/116726-qanda-product-00.html](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/routers/asr-9000-series-aggregation-services-routers/116726-qanda-product-00.html#anc2)      **Determining if the Device Is Configured for IPv6**      Administrators can use the **show ipv6 interface brief** command to determine if an interface is enabled for IPv6 traffic processing. The following example shows an interface configured for IPv6 processing:    ```   RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router# show ipv6 interface brief   GigabitEthernet0/2/0/0 [Up/Up]   fe80::212:daff:fe62:c150   202::1   ...   ```    The **show ipv6 interface brief** command will produce an error message if the running version of Cisco IOS XR Software does not support IPv6. The output will not show any interfaces with IPv6 addresses if IPv6 is disabled.         An interface may be configured for IPv6 processing but may not appear on the output of the **show ipv6 interface brief** command if the interface is part of a bundle or a virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) instance. The **show ipv6 vrf all interface** command can be used to determine whether any interface has been configured in this way. The following is the output of the **show ipv6 vrf all interface** command showing an interface configured for IPv6 processing as part of a bundle and assigned to a VRF instance: ```   RP/0/RP0/CPU0:Router#show ipv6 vrf all interface    ...   Bundle-Ether4.765 is Up, ipv6 protocol is Up, Vrfid is FDA (0x60000001)     IPv6 is enabled, link-local address is fe80::21d:a2ff:aabb:ccdd     Global unicast address(es):       2001:db8:1:1::1, subnet is 2001:db8:1:1::/64      Joined group address(es): ff02::1:ff00:0 ff02::1:aabb:ccdd ff02::2         ff02::1     MTU is 1518 (1500 is available to IPv6)     ICMP redirects are disabled     ICMP unreachables are enabled     ND DAD is enabled, number of DAD attempts 1     ND reachable time is 0 milliseconds     ND advertised retransmit interval is 0 milliseconds     Hosts use stateless autoconfig for addresses.     Outgoing access list is not set     Inbound  access list is not set     Table Id is 0xe0800001      ``` Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.      Cisco Aggregation Services Router (ASR) 9000 Series that do not contain any Trident-based line cards, are not running Cisco IOS XR Software Release 5.3.4, or are not enabled for IPv6 are not affected.      No other devices running Cisco IOS XR Software are affected.  Indicators of Compromise  * Exploitation of this vulnerability could cause the Trident-based line card to reload and generate error messages similar to the following: ```   LC/0/6/CPU0:pfm_node_lc[285]: %PLATFORM-DIAGS-0-LC_NP_LOOPBACK_FAILED_RX_PATH : Set|online_diag_lc[163925]|Line card NPU loopback Test(0x2000006)|link failure mask is 0x20.
