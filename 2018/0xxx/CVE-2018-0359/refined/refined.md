Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-0359:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Cisco Meeting Server's web-based management interface does not generate a new session identifier upon successful user authentication. This means the session ID remains the same even after login.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Session Fixation:** The primary vulnerability is session fixation, where an attacker can potentially obtain a valid, unauthenticated session identifier and then use it to hijack an authenticated user's session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can hijack an authenticated user's browser session by using a captured or predicted session identifier. This allows the attacker to perform actions on the web-based management interface as if they were the legitimate user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker with local access. The content specifies "an unauthenticated, local attacker".

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs local network access to intercept or obtain an existing user's session ID. They do not need to authenticate to initially obtain a session ID.
*   The attacker needs the ability to use the hijacked session identifier to connect to the application through the web-based management interface.

**Additional Notes:**
*   There are no known workarounds available to address this vulnerability.
*   Cisco has released software updates to fix the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during a Cisco TAC support case.
*   The CVSS v3 base score for the vulnerability is 4.0 (Medium), with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N.
