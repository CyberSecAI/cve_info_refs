Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0661:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is related to "Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls" as defined by CWE-264. The vulnerability stems from improper management of access rights to the affected network camera devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access control mechanisms, which allows unauthorized actions.
*   The vulnerability allows for files to be added in specific directories.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker on the adjacent network can add files to a specific directory, leading to the execution of arbitrary OS commands and codes.
*   **Information Disclosure/Modification:** Information, including credentials, can be leaked and altered.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Adjacent Network:** The attack vector is a remote attacker positioned on the same network segment as the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be present on the adjacent network to the targeted camera.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without the need for prior authentication to the device.

**Summary:**

CVE-2018-0661 describes a vulnerability in I-O DATA network camera products where insufficient access controls allow a remote attacker on the adjacent network to inject files and execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to information disclosure or modification.
