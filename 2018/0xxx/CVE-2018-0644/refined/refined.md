Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0644:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Buffer Overflow (CWE-119):** The software does not properly handle the size of the input data, leading to a buffer overflow. This occurs in the `panda-server` component of the ORCA software.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By exploiting the buffer overflow, a malicious actor can cause a denial-of-service condition, potentially crashing the application.
*   **Arbitrary code execution**: The buffer overflow could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution on the server by overwriting memory regions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Adjacent Network:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable ORCA instance to exploit the vulnerability. This is because communication with the service is often performed on a local network.
*   **Specially crafted file**: The user needs to open a specially crafted file while logged into the affected product

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable ORCA system.
*   **User Interaction**: A user must open a specially crafted file for the vulnerability to be exploited
*   **Low Privileges Required**: A user with low privileges is able to exploit the vulnerability.

**Affected Products:**
*   Ubuntu14.04 ORCA(Online Receipt Computer Advantage) 4.8.0(panda-client2) 1:1.4.9+p41-u4jma1 and earlier
*   Ubuntu14.04 ORCA(Online Receipt Computer Advantage) 5.0.0(panda-client2) 1:2.0.0+p48-u4jma1 and earlier
*   Ubuntu16.04 ORCA(Online Receipt Computer Advantage) 5.0.0(panda-client2) 1:2.0.0+p48-u5jma1 and earlier

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was reported by participants of the IoT x Security Hackathon 2016.
*   The vulnerability affects the `panda-client2` component of the ORCA software.
*   The vendor has released updates to address the vulnerability.

**Summary:**

CVE-2018-0644 is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the ORCA software that could allow a local attacker to cause a denial of service, or potentially execute arbitrary code. The attacker would need to be on the same network and requires a user to open a specially crafted file.
