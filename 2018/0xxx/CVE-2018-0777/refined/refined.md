Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0777:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the Microsoft Edge Chakra JIT compiler. During loop optimization, a specific code pattern involving an addition operation within a loop is mishandled. Specifically:
   - In the loop prepass analysis, the `i += 0;` operation is considered a valid relative add operation.
   - This causes Chakra to treat `i` as an induction variable and create a `LoopCount` object that assumes the variable `i` has bounded integer values.
   - However, during actual optimization, the `i += 0;` operation is transformed to a load operation that directly loads `10` to `i`.  This breaks the assumption that i is an induction variable with relative bounds, which then causes the `LoopCount` to fail in calculating the correct bounds, leading to out-of-bounds access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-Bounds Write:** The core vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write due to incorrect bounds calculation during JIT optimization. The vulnerability allows writing data to memory locations outside the intended array bounds.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided exploit is classified as a DoS. The out-of-bounds write can corrupt memory leading to a crash of the browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **JavaScript Execution:** The attacker needs to execute specially crafted JavaScript code within the context of the Microsoft Edge browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Execute JavaScript:** The attacker must be able to deliver and execute malicious JavaScript code within a Microsoft Edge browser instance. This could be achieved through a malicious website, a compromised ad network, or a phishing attack.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided exploit code highlights a specific scenario where the JIT compiler makes incorrect assumptions during optimization leading to the OOB write.
- The vulnerability is triggered due to the discrepancy between the loop analysis stage and the actual optimization phase of the JIT compiler.

This analysis is based on the information provided in the exploit-db content and aligns with the information available for CVE-2018-0777.
