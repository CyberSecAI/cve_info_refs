Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-0117:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insufficient handling of user-supplied data within the ingress packet processing functionality of the Cisco Virtualized Packet Core-Distributed Instance (VPC-DI) Software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way the software processes incoming network packets on the Distributed Instance (DI) network interface. It does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied data within these packets.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could cause an unhandled error on the affected system which results in both Control Function (CF) instances to reload. This triggers a full reload of the VPC, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The DoS results in the disconnection of all subscribers.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to send malicious TCP packets to the internal DI network address via IPv4.
- The DI network is intended to be an isolated network within the VPC-DI instance; however, the vulnerability exists because an attacker can reach the interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have network access to the DI network interface of a vulnerable VPC-DI instance. This implies that the attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the specific internal network address associated with the DI network.
- No authentication is required.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Cisco Virtualized Packet Core-Distributed Instance (VPC-DI) Software. It does not affect the Virtualized Packet Core-Single Instance (VPC-SI) Software, ASR 5000 series routers, Elastic Services Controllers, or Ultra Automation Services.
- There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
- Fixed software versions are provided, and customers are advised to upgrade.
- The CVSS v3 base score is 8.6, which is classified as HIGH severity. The vector string is: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H.
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
