- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The installer for "FLET'S VIRUS CLEAR Easy Setup & Application Tool" and "FLET'S VIRUS CLEAR v6 Easy Setup & Application Tool" has an issue with the DLL search path, leading to insecure loading of Dynamic Link Libraries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure DLL loading due to a flawed search path during the installation process.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user invoking the installer.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could place a malicious DLL file in a location where the installer searches for DLLs. When the installer runs, it loads the malicious DLL, leading to code execution.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick the user into placing a malicious DLL file in a specific location. The attacker does not need special privileges to perform this attack. The user must execute the installer.
