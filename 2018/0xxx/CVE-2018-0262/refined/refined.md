Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-0262:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Incorrect default configuration of the Cisco Meeting Server (CMS). This leads to the exposure of internal interfaces and ports on the external interface of the system.
*   Additionally, the vulnerability can be exploited if the Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN) service is enabled with Transport Layer Security (TLS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** Internal interfaces and ports are incorrectly exposed to the external interface.
*   **TURN Service Vulnerability:** If TURN with TLS is enabled, TURN credentials can be leveraged to forward traffic to device daemons.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can gain unauthorized access to components of the system.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can access configuration and database files, as well as sensitive meeting information.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By forwarding traffic to device daemons using TURN credentials, remote code execution may be achieved.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network.
*   **TURN Server Exploitation:** If the TURN service is enabled with TLS, attackers can exploit the TURN credentials to forward traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the vulnerable CMS system over the network.
*   **TURN Service Enabled (Conditional):** For full exploitation, the TURN service must be enabled with TLS.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Cisco Meeting Server (CMS) Acano X-series platforms running software releases prior to 2.2.11.
*   There are no workarounds available for this vulnerability.
*   Cisco has released software updates to fix this issue (CMS Software Releases 2.2.11 and later).
