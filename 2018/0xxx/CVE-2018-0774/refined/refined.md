Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0774:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the Chakra JavaScript engine, specifically in how it handles scopes during function calls with default parameters.  The engine fails to properly recognize whether a function is referenced within the parameter scope. This leads to the emission of an invalid opcode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect scope handling:** The core issue is that Chakra does not correctly determine when a function is referenced inside the parameter scope of another function.
- **Invalid Opcode Emission:** Due to the incorrect scope handling, the engine generates an invalid opcode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided exploit code causes a crash in the Chakra engine, leading to a denial of service. The impact is limited to crashing the application or browser using the vulnerable engine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **JavaScript Code Execution:** The vulnerability is triggered by executing specially crafted JavaScript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to execute JavaScript:** The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code within an environment that uses the vulnerable Chakra engine (e.g., a web browser).

**Additional Notes**
