Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The installer for Glary Utilities (versions 5.99 and earlier) has an issue with the DLL search path, which can lead to insecurely loading Dynamic Link Libraries. This is a classic case of a DLL hijacking vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element:** The installer does not properly specify the paths where it should load DLLs, allowing an attacker to introduce a malicious DLL that the installer will load instead of the legitimate one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the user running the installer. This can lead to a complete compromise of the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local:** The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in a location where the installer will search for it.
- The vulnerability is in the installer, so it only occurs during the installation process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to trick the user into running the installer.
- The attacker also needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in a specific folder that the installer will search. The location is not specified in the provided content.
- User interaction (running the installer) is required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is only present in the installer, not the installed software itself.
- CVSS v3 score of 7.8 suggests a high severity.
- The provided analysis assumes that the user is tricked into placing a malicious DLL file in a specific folder.

This information aligns with the general description of DLL hijacking and provides specific details related to the Glary Utilities installer.
