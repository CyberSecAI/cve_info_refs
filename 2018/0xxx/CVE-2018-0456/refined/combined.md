The vulnerability is due to improper validation of SNMP protocol data units (PDUs) in SNMP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the SNMP application to restart multiple times, leading to a system-level restart and a denial of service (DoS) condition.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco NX-OS Software:    + Nexus 3000 Series Switches   + Nexus 3600 Platform Switches   + Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode   + Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules The only vulnerable software release for Nexus 3000 Series Switches and for Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode is 7.0(3)I7(3).  The only vulnerable software release for Nexus 3600 Platform Switches and Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules is 7.0(3)F3(4).  Refer to the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this security advisory for more information about affected releases. Determining the Status of SNMP Administrators can determine whether SNMP is running on a device by using the **show running-config snmp** command in the device CLI. If the command returns output, SNMP is configured.  ```   nxos-switch# show running-config snmp   .   .   .   snmp-server user admin network-admin auth md5 ***** priv ***** localizedkey   snmp-server community community-string group network-admin   ``` Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Firepower 2100 Series   + Firepower 4100 Series Next-Generation Firewall   + Firepower 9300 Security Appliance   + MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches   + Nexus 1000V Switch for Microsoft Hyper-V   + Nexus 1000V Switch for VMware vSphere   + Nexus 2000 Series Switches   + Nexus 3500 Platform Switches   + Nexus 5500 Platform Switches   + Nexus 5600 Platform Switches   + Nexus 6000 Series Switches   + Nexus 7000 Series Switches   + Nexus 7700 Series Switches   + Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode   + Unified Computing System (UCS) 6100 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects  Details  * SNMP is an application-layer protocol that provides a standardized framework and a common language for monitoring and managing devices in a network. It defines a message format for communication between SNMP managers and agents.  An SNMP agent gathers data from the SNMP MIB, which is the repository of information about device parameters and network data. It also responds to requests from an SNMP manager to get or set data. An SNMP agent contains MIB variables for which values can be requested or changed by an SNMP manager by using **get** or **set** operations.  This vulnerability affects all versions of SNMP supported on the device-Versions 1, 2c, and 3. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific SNMP packet to an affected device via IPv4 or IPv6. Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability.  To exploit this vulnerability via SNMP Version 2c or earlier, the attacker must know the SNMP read-only community string for the affected system. A community string is a password that is applied to a device to restrict both *read-only* and *read-write* access to the SNMP data on the device. These community strings, as with all passwords, should be chosen carefully to ensure that they are not trivial. They should also be changed at regular intervals and in accordance with network security policies. For example, the strings should be changed when a network administrator changes roles or leaves the organization.  To exploit this vulnerability via SNMP Version 3, the attacker must have user credentials for the affected system.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  As a mitigation for the vulnerability that is described in this advisory, administrators can configure an access control list (ACL) on an SNMP community. This ACL will filter incoming SNMP requests to ensure that SNMP polling is performed only by trusted SNMP clients. In the following example, the device will accept incoming SNMP requests only from the trusted hosts 192.168.1.2 and 192.168.1.3:  ```   switch# show access-list acl_for_snmpIPV4 ACL acl_for_snmp     10 permit udp 192.168.1.2/32 192.168.1.3/32 eq snmp   ```  To implement the preceding ACL, administrators can add it to the **snmp-server community** configuration command:  ```   switch# show running-config snmp   snmp-server community mycompany    use-acl acl_for_snmp   ```  For additional information about configuring ACLs to filter incoming SNMP requests, see [Filtering SNMP Requests](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus5000/sw/system_management/b_Cisco_Nexus_5000_Series_NX-OS_System_Management_Configuration_Guide/Cisco_Nexus_5000_Series_NX-OS_System_Management_Configuration_Guide_chapter9.html#task_D3862190751F4B1A9F5353B015A888A7) in the Cisco NX-OS configuration guide.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 7.7 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 7.7 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 7.7 |
