Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-0456

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper validation of Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) protocol data units (PDUs) within SNMP packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient validation of SNMP PDUs.
- The vulnerability affects all SNMP versions supported by the device (Versions 1, 2c, and 3).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to the unexpected restart of the SNMP application on the affected device.
- Repeated restarts of the SNMP application can cause a system-level restart, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attack via network.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected device.
- Exploitation is possible over both IPv4 and IPv6.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **For SNMP v1 or v2c:** The attacker needs to know the read-only community string for the affected system.
- **For SNMP v3:** The attacker needs valid user credentials for the affected system.
- The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable system.

**Affected Products:**
- Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches (only version 7.0(3)I7(3) is vulnerable).
- Cisco Nexus 3600 Platform Switches (only version 7.0(3)F3(4) is vulnerable).
- Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode (only version 7.0(3)I7(3) is vulnerable).
- Cisco Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules (only version 7.0(3)F3(4) is vulnerable).

**Mitigations:**
- There are no workarounds that directly address the vulnerability.
- As a mitigation, administrators can configure an access control list (ACL) on an SNMP community to filter incoming SNMP requests from trusted clients.
- Software updates are available.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was found during internal security testing.
- There are no known public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 7.7 (High).
- The attack requires a low privilege account if SNMPv3 is used and low complexity network access.
