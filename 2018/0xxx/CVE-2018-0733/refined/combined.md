#### Description

There is an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedure used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH1024 are considered just feasible, because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This only affects processors that support the AVX2 but not ADX extensions like Intel Haswell (4th generation). Note: The impact from this issue is similar to CVE-2017-3736, CVE-2017-3732 and CVE-2015-3193. OpenSSL version 1.0.2-1.0.2m and 1.1.0-1.1.0g are affected. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2n. Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing a new release of OpenSSL 1.1.0 at this time. The fix will be included in OpenSSL 1.1.0h when it becomes available. The fix is also available in commit e502cc86d in the OpenSSL git repository.

# [R1] Industrial Security 1.1.0 Fixes One Third-party Vulnerability

Medium

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

Industrial Security leverages third-party software to help provide underlying functionality. One of the third-party components (OpenSSL) were found to contain vulnerabilities, and updated versions have been made available by the providers.

Out of caution and in line with good practice, Tenable opted to upgrade the bundled OpenSSL to address the potential impact of these issues. Industrial Security 1.1.0 updates OpenSSL to version 1.0.2o to address the identified vulnerabilities.

### Solution

Tenable has released Industrial Security 1.1.0 to address this issue. The new version can be obtained from the Tenable Download Page (https://www.tenable.com/downloads/industrial-security).

OpenSSL Security Advisory [27 Mar 2018]
========================================
Constructed ASN.1 types with a recursive definition could exceed the stack (CVE-2018-0739)
==========================================================================================
Severity: Moderate
Constructed ASN.1 types with a recursive definition (such as can be found in
PKCS7) could eventually exceed the stack given malicious input with
excessive recursion. This could result in a Denial Of Service attack. There are
no such structures used within SSL/TLS that come from untrusted sources so this
is considered safe.
OpenSSL 1.1.0 users should upgrade to 1.1.0h
OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2o
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 4th January 2018 by the OSS-fuzz project.
The fix was developed by Matt Caswell of the OpenSSL development team.
Incorrect CRYPTO\_memcmp on HP-UX PA-RISC (CVE-2018-0733)
========================================================
Severity: Moderate
Because of an implementation bug the PA-RISC CRYPTO\_memcmp function is
effectively reduced to only comparing the least significant bit of each byte.
This allows an attacker to forge messages that would be considered as
authenticated in an amount of tries lower than that guaranteed by the security
claims of the scheme. The module can only be compiled by the HP-UX assembler, so
that only HP-UX PA-RISC targets are affected.
OpenSSL 1.1.0 users should upgrade to 1.1.0h
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 2nd March 2018 by Peter Waltenberg (IBM).
The fix was developed by Andy Polyakov of the OpenSSL development team.
rsaz\_1024\_mul\_avx2 overflow bug on x86\_64 (CVE-2017-3738)
=========================================================
Severity: Low
This issue has been reported in a previous OpenSSL security advisory and a fix
was provided for OpenSSL 1.0.2. Due to the low severity no fix was released at
that time for OpenSSL 1.1.0. The fix is now available in OpenSSL 1.1.0h.
There is an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedure
used in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected.
Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect
would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks
against DH1024 are considered just feasible, because most of the work
necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline.
The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant.
However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share
the DH1024 private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option
since CVE-2016-0701.
This only affects processors that support the AVX2 but not ADX extensions
like Intel Haswell (4th generation).
Note: The impact from this issue is similar to CVE-2017-3736, CVE-2017-3732
and CVE-2015-3193.
OpenSSL 1.1.0 users should upgrade to 1.1.0h
OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2n
This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 22nd November 2017 by David Benjamin
(Google). The issue was originally found via the OSS-Fuzz project. The fix was
developed by Andy Polyakov of the OpenSSL development team.

Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing a new release of OpenSSL 1.1.0 at this time. The fix will be included in OpenSSL 1.1.0h when it becomes available. The fix is also available in commit e502cc86d in the OpenSSL git repository.

#### Description

Constructed ASN.1 types with a recursive definition (such as can be found in PKCS7) could eventually exceed the stack given malicious input with excessive recursion. This could result in a Denial Of Service attack. There are no such structures used within SSL/TLS that come from untrusted sources so this is considered safe. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0h (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0g). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2o (Affected 1.0.2b-1.0.2n).

* [Plugins](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2018-0733%20/plugins)

#### Description

Because of an implementation bug the PA-RISC CRYPTO\_memcmp function is effectively reduced to only comparing the least significant bit of each byte. This allows an attacker to forge messages that would be considered as authenticated in an amount of tries lower than that guaranteed by the security claims of the scheme. The module can only be compiled by the HP-UX assembler, so that only HP-UX PA-RISC targets are affected. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0h (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0g).

# [R1] OpenSSL Stand-alone Patch Available for SecurityCenter versions 5.0 or Later

Medium

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

SecurityCenter leverages third-party software to help provide underlying functionality. One of the third-party components (OpenSSL) was found to contain vulnerabilities, and updated versions have been made available by the providers.

Out of caution and in line with good practice, Tenable opted to provide a stand-alone OpenSSL patch to address the potential impact of these issues in SecurityCenter. This stand-alone patch updates OpenSSL to version 1.0.2o to address the identified vulnerabilities.

### Solution

Tenable has provided a stand-alone patch to address these issues. The patch can be obtained from the Tenable Downloads Portal (https://www.tenable.com/downloads/securitycenter-3d-tool-and-xtool).

**Steps to apply:**

Note: If you are applying the patch to a Tenable appliance, you must enable SSH access as described in the Tenable Appliance User Guide. If you are running a Tenable appliance version earlier than 4.4.0, contact Support for assistance.

1. Download the appropriate patch to SecurityCenter or your appliance. The files can be placed anywhere, though /tmp is a good choice.

2. Untar the patch file: "tar zxf SC-201805.1-5.x.tgz"

3. Change the directory to the extracted directory: "cd SC-201805.1-5.x"

4. Run the install: "sh ./install.sh"

#### Description

Because of an implementation bug the PA-RISC CRYPTO\_memcmp function is effectively reduced to only comparing the least significant bit of each byte. This allows an attacker to forge messages that would be considered as authenticated in an amount of tries lower than that guaranteed by the security claims of the scheme. The module can only be compiled by the HP-UX assembler, so that only HP-UX PA-RISC targets are affected. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0h (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0g).

#### Description

Constructed ASN.1 types with a recursive definition (such as can be found in PKCS7) could eventually exceed the stack given malicious input with excessive recursion. This could result in a Denial Of Service attack. There are no such structures used within SSL/TLS that come from untrusted sources so this is considered safe. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0h (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0g). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2o (Affected 1.0.2b-1.0.2n).

# [R1] Nessus Network Monitor 5.5.0 Fixes One Third-party Vulnerability

Medium

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

Nessus Network Monitor leverages third-party software to help provide underlying functionality. One of the third-party components (OpenSSL) were found to contain vulnerabilities, and updated versions have been made available by the providers.

Out of caution and in line with good practice, Tenable opted to upgrade the bundled OpenSSL to address the potential impact of these issues. Nessus Network Monitor 5.5.0 updates OpenSSL to version 1.0.2o to address the identified vulnerabilities.

### Solution

Tenable has released Nessus Network Monitor 5.5.0 to address this issue. The new version can be obtained from the Tenable Downloads Page (https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus-network-monitor).
