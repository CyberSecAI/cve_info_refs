{
  "CVE-2018-0733": {
    "Description": "The PA-RISC CRYPTO_memcmp function is effectively reduced to comparing only the least significant bit of each byte due to an implementation bug. This allows attackers to forge messages that would be considered authenticated with fewer attempts than the security of the scheme claims. This vulnerability only affects HP-UX PA-RISC targets because the module can only be compiled by the HP-UX assembler.",
    "Root cause": "Implementation bug in the PA-RISC CRYPTO_memcmp function.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect comparison logic in `CRYPTO_memcmp` function",
       "The function only compares the least significant bit of each byte, allowing for message forging."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can forge messages that would be considered authenticated with fewer tries than expected.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when comparing data using the flawed `CRYPTO_memcmp` on affected HP-UX PA-RISC systems.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs the ability to provide input to a function that uses CRYPTO_memcmp on an HP-UX PA-RISC system."
