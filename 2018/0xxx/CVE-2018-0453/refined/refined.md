- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of authentication in the Sourcefire tunnel control channel protocol, which allows Firepower sensors to issue commands to the Cisco FMC or other devices managed by the FMC without proper authorization. Specifically, the affected software performs insufficient checks for certain CLI commands executed via a Sourcefire tunnel connection.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Insufficient authentication in the Sourcefire tunnel control channel protocol.
    - Lack of proper checks on CLI commands executed through the tunnel.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute specific CLI commands with root privileges on the Cisco FMC or other Firepower sensors/devices managed by the same FMC.
    - This can lead to modification of device configurations.
    - Deletion of files on affected devices is possible.
    -  Complete compromise of affected devices.

- **Attack vectors**:
    - The attacker must be local to the affected system (Cisco FMC or a Firepower sensor).
    - Exploitation occurs through the Sourcefire tunnel control channel.
    - Attackers leverage the ability to issue unauthorized CLI commands.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Requires an attacker to have root privileges on at least one affected sensor or the Cisco FMC.
    - The attacker must be able to establish a Sourcefire tunnel connection to the Cisco FMC.
