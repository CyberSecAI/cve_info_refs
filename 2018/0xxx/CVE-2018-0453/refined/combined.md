To send the commands, the attacker must have *root* privileges for at least one affected sensor or the Cisco FMC.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThis vulnerability affects the following Cisco products, if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco Firepower System Software:   + Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) 5500-X Series with FirePOWER Services   + Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls   + FirePOWER 7000 Series Appliances   + FirePOWER 8000 Series Appliances   + Firepower 2100 Series Security Appliances   + Firepower 4100 Series Security Appliances   + Firepower 9300 Series Security Appliances   + Firepower Management Center   + Firepower Threat Defense   + Firepower Threat Defense Virtual (FTDv)   + Virtual Next-Generation Intrusion Prevention System (NGIPSv) For information about which Cisco Firepower System Software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.  **Determine the Firepower System Software Release**    To determine which Cisco Firepower System Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the **show version** command in the CLI, and refer to the output of the command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco Firepower System Software Release 6.2.0:  ```   > show version   ```  ```   ---------------------[ ftd ]---------------------Model : Cisco ASA5525-X Threat Defense (75) Version 6.2.0 (Build 362)UUID : 2849ba3c-ecb8-11e6-98ca-b9fc2975893cRules update version : 2017-03-15-001-vrtVDB version : 279---------------------------------------------------   ``` Products Confirmed Not VulnerableOnly products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.      Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:   + 3000 Series Industrial Security Appliances (ISAs)   + Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software   + Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) Software  Details  * Cisco FMC is the management device on the network for Cisco Firepower sensors. Firepower sensors run Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software. For more information about Firepower software and platforms, refer to the [Cisco Firepower Compatibility Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/compatibility/firepower-compatibility.html).  The Sourcefire tunnel control channel protocol is used by Cisco FMC to manage and control Firepower sensors. A Sourcefire tunnel connection, which is a connection that uses this protocol, is used for communication between Cisco FMC and Firepower sensors. Cisco FMC is intended to control Firepower sensors. However, authentication should be required for Firepower sensors to issue commands to Cisco FMC or to other devices that are managed by Cisco FMC. The vulnerability described in this advisory is caused by a lack of authentication.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * For information about affected and fixed software releases, consult the Cisco bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.  Source  * This vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 8.2 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.2 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 8.2 |

To send the commands, the attacker must have root privileges for at least one affected sensor or the Cisco FMC.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability exists because the affected software performs insufficient checks for certain CLI commands, if the commands are executed via a Sourcefire tunnel connection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating with root privileges to a Firepower sensor or Cisco FMC, and then sending specific CLI commands to the Cisco FMC or through the Cisco FMC to another Firepower sensor via the Sourcefire tunnel connection. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify device configurations or delete files on the device that is running Cisco FMC Software or on any Firepower device that is managed by Cisco FMC.\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-fp-cmd-injection [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-fp-cmd-injection\"]"
