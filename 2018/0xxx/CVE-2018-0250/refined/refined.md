Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-0250

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the Cisco Aironet Access Points ignoring the Access Control List (ACL) download from a client during the initial authentication process when using Central Web Authentication (CWA) with FlexConnect.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper enforcement of client-side ACLs during the initial CWA authentication with FlexConnect.
- The Access Point (AP) fails to apply the downloaded ACL correctly during the first authentication attempt.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can bypass configured client FlexConnect ACLs. This could allow unauthorized access to network resources or services that should have been restricted by the ACL.
- Specifically, the attacker, after successful authentication, is not restricted by the intended ACL, which may lead to unauthorized access to the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker must be adjacent to the affected access point.
- The attacker must authenticate via CWA with FlexConnect.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be physically within range of the vulnerable AP to connect to it wirelessly.
- The attacker must have valid credentials to authenticate to the network.
- The attacker must be an authenticated user connecting to the targeted device with a vulnerable configuration.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco Aironet 1560, 1810, 1810w, 1815, 1830, 1850, 2800, and 3800 Series APs.
- Central Web Authentication with FlexConnect Access Points was an unsupported configuration until 8.5.100.0.
- A workaround is to force a client to re-authenticate, as the ACL is properly applied on subsequent authentications.
- The vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
