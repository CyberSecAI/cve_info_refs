Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0189:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a limitation in how the Forwarding Information Base (FIB) within Cisco IOS and IOS XE software handles recursive routes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The FIB has an internal limitation in representing recursive routes. This flaw allows an attacker to exploit it by injecting routes with specific recursive patterns into the routing protocol.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. Specifically, it can cause the affected device to reload, disrupting network services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based, meaning that the attacker needs to be on the network.
- An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability by injecting malicious routes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be positioned on the network in a way that enables them to inject a number of recursive routes with a specific pattern into the routing protocol.
- No authentication is needed to inject routes.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability lies in the FIB's inability to correctly manage certain patterns of recursive routes. An attacker, located on the network, can trigger a DoS by injecting these specially crafted routes, causing the affected device to reload.
