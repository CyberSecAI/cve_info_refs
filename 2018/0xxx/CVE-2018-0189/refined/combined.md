Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software.  For information about which Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software releases are vulnerable, consult the Cisco bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory.  Determining the Cisco IOS Software Release To determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the **show version** command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to *Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software* or *Cisco IOS Software*. The banner also displays the installed image name in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.5(2)T1 and has an installed image name of *C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M*:  ```   Router> show version      Cisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)   Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport   Copyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.   Compiled Mon 22-Jun-15 09:32 by prod_rel_team   .   .   .   ```  For information about the naming and numbering conventions for Cisco IOS Software releases, see the [Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/ios-nx-os-reference-guide.html).  Determining the Cisco IOS XE Software Release To determine which Cisco IOS XE Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the **show version** command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS XE Software, the system banner displays *Cisco IOS Software*, *Cisco IOS XE Software*, or similar text.  The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 16.2.1 and has an installed image name of *CAT3K\_CAA-UNIVERSALK9-M*:  ```   ios-xe-device# show version      Cisco IOS Software, Catalyst L3 Switch Software (CAT3K_CAA-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version Denali 16.2.1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)   Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport   Copyright (c) 1986-2016 by Cisco Systems, Inc.

Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.      Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco IOS XR Software or Cisco NX-OS Software.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * For detailed information about fixed software releases, consult the Cisco bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory.  For a mapping of Cisco IOS XE Software releases to Cisco IOS Software releases, refer to the [Cisco IOS XE 2 Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/2/release/notes/rnasr21/rnasr21_gen.html#wp3000032), [Cisco IOS XE 3S Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/3/release/notes/asr1k_rn_3s_rel_notes/asr1k_rn_3s_sys_req.html#wp3069754), or [Cisco IOS XE 3SG Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL_24726.html#pgfId-2570252), depending on the Cisco IOS XE Software release.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

"text": "A vulnerability in the Forwarding Information Base (FIB) code of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, network attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a limitation in the way the FIB is internally representing recursive routes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting routes into the routing protocol that have a specific recursive pattern. The attacker must be in a position on the network that provides the ability to inject a number of recursive routes with a specific pattern. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause an affected device to reload, creating a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-FIB-dos [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-FIB-dos\"]"

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 6.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 6.8 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 6.8 |
