Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-0195:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability is caused by insufficient authorization checks for requests sent to the Cisco IOS XE Software REST API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Authorization Bypass:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks, allowing an attacker to bypass intended access controls.
- **Insufficient Authorization Checks:** Requests to the REST API are not adequately validated, which leads to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privileged Actions:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to bypass authorization checks and use the API to perform privileged actions on an affected device.
- This could lead to unauthorized configuration changes, information disclosure, or other malicious activities on the affected Cisco device.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **REST API:** The attack is performed by sending a malicious request to the REST API of the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to use the REST API.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the device to send the malicious REST API request.

**Summary:**

CVE-2018-0195 is an authorization bypass vulnerability in the Cisco IOS XE Software REST API. An authenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious request to the API, allowing them to bypass authorization checks and perform privileged actions on the affected device. There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability and it requires a software update to resolve.
