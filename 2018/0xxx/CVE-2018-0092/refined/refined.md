Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper role-based access control (RBAC) checks in the *network-operator* user role implementation within Cisco NX-OS System Software. This allows the *network-operator* role to perform actions it should not be authorized to do, specifically deleting user accounts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper access control: The *network-operator* user role is granted excessive privileges, enabling it to delete other configured user accounts, an action it should not be able to perform.
-  Insufficient RBAC: The system fails to enforce proper role-based access control, allowing users with the *network-operator* role to bypass intended restrictions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Integrity Impact:** Successful exploitation enables the attacker to delete valid user accounts, potentially disrupting device administration and operations. This could lead to loss of access for legitimate users and impact the overall integrity of the device configuration.
- **Availability Impact:** The ability to delete user accounts could result in a denial of access to the device, impacting availability of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local Access: The attacker must have local access to the device to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid user credentials for the device with the *network-operator* role.

**Affected products:**
- Nexus 3000 Series Switches
- Nexus 3600 Platform Switches
- Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode
- Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
- No workarounds are available.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
- There is no public information or known malicious use of this vulnerability at the time of the advisory.
