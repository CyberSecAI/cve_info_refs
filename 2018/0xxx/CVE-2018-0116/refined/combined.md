Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThis vulnerability affects the Cisco Policy Suite application running a release prior to 13.1.0 with Hotfix Patch 1 when RADIUS authentication is configured for a domain. Cisco Policy Suite Release 14.0.0 is also affected, as it includes vulnerable code, but RADIUS authentication is not officially supported in Cisco Policy Suite Releases 14.0.0 and later. See the [Fixed Software](#Fixed) section of this security advisory for additional information about the affected software versions.      To determine which software version is running on the application, administrators can issue the **about.sh** command from the CLI. In the following example, the device is running software release **12.1.0**: ```   # about.shCisco Policy Suite - Copyright (c) 2015. All rights reserved.CPS Multi-Node EnvironmentCPS Installer Version - 12.1.0...CPS Patch History---------------------------No patches have been applied...    ```    The system is vulnerable only if RADIUS is used for authentication in a domain. RADIUS authentication is not enabled by default. Administrators can use the Policy Builder GUI to verify if RADIUS authentication is configured for a domain by accessing the **Services** tab and selecting the appropriate domain under the **Domains** tab. On the **General** tab, administrators can check if **USuM Authorization** is selected and the **User Id Field** and **Password Field** are populated with **RADIUS Username** and **RADIUS Password** respectively.   Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:      <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.  **Customers Without Service Contracts**  Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.  **Fixed Releases**  In the following table, the left column lists major releases of Cisco Policy Suite software. The right column indicates whether a major release is affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and the first minor release that includes the fix for this vulnerability.      Customers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the following table:       | **Cisco Policy Suite Major Release** | **First Fixed Release for This Vulnerability** |   | --- | --- |   | Prior 12.x | Vulnerable. Upgrade to 13.1.0 and apply Hotfix Patch 1. |   | 12.x | Vulnerable. Upgrade to 13.1.0 and apply Hotfix Patch 1. |   | 13.0 | Vulnerable. Upgrade to 13.1.0 and apply Hotfix Patch 1. |   | 13.1 | Vulnerable. Apply Hotfix Patch 1. |   | 14.0 | Vulnerable. 1 |   | 18.0 | Not vulnerable. |         1 Cisco Policy Suite Release 14.0 includes vulnerable code, but does not officially support RADIUS authentication. The subsequent Cisco Policy Suite Release 18.0 does not support RADIUS authentication and does not include vulnerable code.      The Cisco Policy Suite 13.1.0 Hotfix Patch 1 and other Cisco Policy Suite software can be downloaded from the [Software Center](https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html) on Cisco.com by choosing **Downloads Home > Products > Wireless > Mobile Internet > Policy Suite for Service Providers > Policy Suite for Wi-Fi** > **Cisco Policy Suite (CPS) Software**      To apply the Hotfix Patch 1 on Cisco Policy Suite Release 13.1.0, please refer to the *Apply a Patch* section in the [CPS Migration and Upgrade Guide, Release 13.1.0](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/quantum-policy-suite/R23-2-0/CPS-MigrationandUpgradeGuide/cps23-2-0migrationandupgradeguide/m_applypatchescps.html?bookSearch=true#id_11097) document.       To verify if the Hotfix Patch 1 has been applied to the system, administrators can issue the **about.sh** command from the CLI. In the following example, the output from the **about.sh** command provides verification that the patch has been installed: ```   # about.shCisco Policy Suite - Copyright (c) 2015.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 7.2 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 7.2 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 7.2 |
