Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0116:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from incorrect RADIUS user credential validation in the Cisco Policy Suite.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Authentication:** The system fails to properly validate RADIUS user credentials. Specifically, it does not require a password for authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can gain authorization as a subscriber without providing a valid password, as long as a valid username is provided.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** The attacker could potentially gain access to services and resources intended for authorized subscribers.
*   **Compromised Confidentiality and Integrity:** While the advisory does not specify the extent of the access or the actions an attacker can take, the CVSS score includes low impacts on confidentiality and integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Attack:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over a network.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated prior to exploitation.
*   The attack vector is **Network**.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Cisco Policy Suite system.
*   **Valid Username:** The attacker must know a valid username that is configured in the RADIUS authentication system.
*   No specific user interaction is required.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Cisco Policy Suite releases prior to 13.1.0 with Hotfix Patch 1, as well as release 14.0.0 when RADIUS authentication is configured for a domain. Release 14.0.0 does not officially support RADIUS.
*   RADIUS authentication is not enabled by default.
*   No workarounds are available, a software update/patch is required to fix the vulnerability.
*   The exploit does not require any specific user interaction.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
