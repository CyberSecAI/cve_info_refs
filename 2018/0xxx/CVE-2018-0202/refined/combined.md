Package        : clamav
Version        : 0.99.4+dfsg-1+deb7u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-0202 CVE-2018-1000085

Some vulnerabilities have been found in ClamAV, an open source antivirus
engine:

CVE-2018-0202

    It was found that ClamAV didn't process certain PDF files correctly,
    relating to a heap overflow. Specially crafted PDFs could yield ClamAV
    to crash, resulting in a denial-of-service or potentially execution of
    arbitrary code.

CVE-2018-1000085

    Hanno Böck discovered that ClamAV didn't process XAR files correctly.
    Malformed XAR files could cause ClamAV to crash by an out of bounds
    heap read. This could result in a denial-of-service.

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
0.99.4+dfsg-1+deb7u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your clamav packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
