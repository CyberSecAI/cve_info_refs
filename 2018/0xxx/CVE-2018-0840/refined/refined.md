{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Chakra JIT engine updates the ImplicitCallFlags after an implicit call, which can be bypassed if an exception occurs during the implicit call and is subsequently ignored.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Bypass of ImplicitCallFlags checks in the Chakra JIT engine due to improper handling of exceptions during implicit calls.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, although the provided example doesn't directly demonstrate a critical memory corruption.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a JavaScript function throws an exception during an implicit call and the exception is caught by a \"typeof\" operation. The vulnerability is present when processing specific javascript code that uses 'typeof' and objects with a 'toString' method.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to execute arbitrary JavaScript code, typically within a Microsoft Edge browser. This could involve crafting a malicious webpage or exploiting another vulnerability to inject the code."
