Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThe vulnerability affects the following Cisco ISE products:   + Cisco ISE   + Cisco ISE Express   + Cisco ISE Virtual ApplianceTo determine which release of the software is currently running on a device, administrators may use the **show version** command in the device CLI or navigate to the top-right corner and click **Settings** (gear icon) **> About Identity Service Engine** in the Admin portal. The output of the command in the CLI is similar to the following example: ```   ServiceEngine115/admin# show version    ```  ```   Cisco Application Deployment Engine OS Release: 2.3ADE-OS Build Version: 2.3.0.187ADE-OS System Architecture: x86_64Copyright (c) 2005-2014 by Cisco Systems, Inc.All rights reserved.Hostname: ServiceEngine115Version information of installed applications---------------------------------------------Cisco Identity Services Engine---------------------------------------------Version      : 2.0.0.306Build Date   : Thu Oct  8 13:25:23 2015Install Date : Tue Nov 17 21:02:22 2015     Cisco Identity Services Engine Patch ---------------------------------------------Version      : 5Install Date : Fri Jul 07 01:57:01 2017   ``` Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability. Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco ISE Passive Identity Connector.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.  **Customers Without Service Contracts**  Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.  **Fixed Releases**       | Cisco Identity Services Engine Release | First Fixed Release for This Vulnerability |   | --- | --- |   | Prior to 1.4.0 | Vulnerable; migrate to 1.4.0.253-Patch12 |   | 1.4.0 | 1.4.0.253-Patch12 |   | 2.0.0 | Vulnerable; migrate to 2.1.0.474-Patch7 |   | 2.0.1 | Vulnerable; migrate to 2.1.0.474-Patch7 |   | 2.1.0 | 2.1.0.474-Patch7 |   | 2.2.0 | 2.2.0.470-Patch5 |   | 2.3.0 | Not vulnerable |  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator: Â  Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV:Â Local AV:Â Adjacent AV:Â Network AV:Â Physical  Attack Complexity AC:Â Low AC:Â High  Privileges Required PR:Â None PR:Â Low PR:Â High  User Interaction UI:Â Required UI:Â None  Scope S:Â Unchanged S:Â Changed  Confidentiality Impact C:Â None C:Â Low C:Â High  Integrity Impact I:Â None I:Â Low I:Â High  Availability Impact A:Â None A:Â Low A:Â High     Base Score: 8.6 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E:Â Unproven  E:Â Proof-of-Concept  E:Â Functional  E:Â High  E:Â Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL:Â Official-Fix  RL:Â Temporary-Fix  RL:Â Workaround  RL:Â Unavailable  RL:Â Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC:Â Unknown  RC:Â Reasonable  RC:Â Confirmed  RC:Â Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.6 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR:Â Low  CR:Â Medium  CR:Â Not Defined  CR:Â High   Integrity Requirement IR:Â Low  IR:Â Medium  IR:Â Not Defined  IR:Â High   Availability Requirement AR:Â Low  AR:Â Medium  AR:Â Not Defined  AR:Â High   Modified Attack Vector MAV:Â Local  MAV:Â Adjacent  MAV:Â Network  MAV:Â Physical  MAV:Â Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC:Â Low  MAC:Â High  MAC:Â Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR:Â None  MPR:Â Low  MPR:Â High  MPR:Â Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI:Â Required  MUI:Â None  MUI:Â Not Defined   Modified Scope MS:Â Unchanged  MS:Â Changed  MS:Â Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC:Â None  MC:Â Low  MC:Â High  MC:Â Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI:Â None  MI:Â Low  MI:Â High  MI:Â Not Defined   Modified Availability MA:Â None  MA:Â Low  MA:Â High  MA:Â Not Defined      Environmental Score: 8.6 |

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by initiating EAP authentication over TLS to the ISE with a crafted EAP-TLS certificate. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to restart the ISE application server, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected system. The ISE application could continue to restart while the client attempts to establish the EAP authentication connection.\r\n\r\nIf an attacker attempted to import the same EAP-TLS certificate to the ISE trust store, it could trigger a DoS condition on the affected system. This exploit vector would require the attacker to have valid administrator credentials.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180516-iseeap [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180516-iseeap\"]"
