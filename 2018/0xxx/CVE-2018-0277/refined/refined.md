Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-0277

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from incomplete input validation of the client EAP-TLS certificate during EAP authentication in Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Inadequate validation of the client EAP-TLS certificate.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause the ISE application server to restart unexpectedly, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition.
- The ISE application could continuously restart as the attacker attempts to establish the EAP authentication connection.
- If an attacker imports a crafted EAP-TLS certificate to the ISE trust store, it could also trigger a DoS condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker can initiate EAP authentication over TLS with a crafted EAP-TLS certificate.
- An attacker with valid administrator credentials can import a malicious EAP-TLS certificate to the ISE trust store.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- For the primary attack vector, the attacker needs to be able to initiate EAP authentication over TLS. No authentication is required for this.
- For the secondary attack vector, the attacker needs valid administrator credentials to import a crafted certificate.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco ISE, Cisco ISE Express, and Cisco ISE Virtual Appliance.
- There are no workarounds available.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
- The CVSS base score is 8.6, with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H.
