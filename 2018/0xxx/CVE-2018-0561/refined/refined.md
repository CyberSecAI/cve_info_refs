Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The installer of PhishWall Client Internet Explorer edition has an issue with the DLL search path, leading to insecure loading of Dynamic Link Libraries. This is due to the installer not properly specifying the location to load DLLs, causing it to search in potentially attacker-controlled locations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-427:**  Insecure Search Path or Path Traversal. The installer does not correctly specify the location from which to load DLLs, allowing for the possibility of loading a malicious DLL from a location controlled by an attacker.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user who runs the installer. This means that if an attacker can place a malicious DLL in a location where the installer will search, they can execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user who is installing PhishWall.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local: An attacker needs local access to the system to place a malicious DLL in a location where the installer will search for it. The user must then run the vulnerable installer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL file in a specific folder that is searched by the installer. This typically involves tricking the user to place a malicious DLL in the path searched by the installer. The user also needs to execute the installer.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in the installer, not in the application itself. Therefore, users who have already installed PhishWall Client Internet Explorer edition do not need to re-install if they used a secure installer.
- The issue was confirmed to be related to how InstallShield was used and was addressed by applying the latest hotfixes available for InstallShield.
- Users of Windows 7 must first apply Windows 7 security patch (KB2533623) before using the updated installer.
- The vulnerability can be exploited even if the user has no special privileges.
