Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-0347:

**Root Cause:**
- Insufficient input validation in the Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) subsystem of the Cisco SD-WAN Solution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Command Injection: The lack of proper input validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute commands with root privileges on the affected device.
- Full System Compromise: Due to root-level access, the attacker can potentially gain complete control over the compromised system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by malicious input to an affected parameter in the ZTP subsystem.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated Local Access: The attacker must be authenticated to the device to access the affected parameter.

**Summary of the Vulnerability:**

CVE-2018-0347 describes a command injection vulnerability in the Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) subsystem of the Cisco SD-WAN Solution. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An authenticated, local attacker can exploit this by sending malicious input to an affected parameter, allowing for arbitrary command execution with root privileges, and potentially complete system compromise.

**Affected Products:**
- vEdge 100 Series Routers
- vEdge 1000 Series Routers
- vEdge 2000 Series Routers
- vEdge 5000 Series Routers
(running a release of the Cisco SD-WAN Solution prior to Release 18.3.0)

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in Cisco SD-WAN Solution Release 18.3.0. Cisco advises users to upgrade to the fixed release to mitigate this vulnerability. There are no workarounds available.

This information is consistent with the provided CVSS score (Base 7.8, High severity) and the description of the vulnerability as a command injection issue that can lead to root privileges and complete compromise.
