- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `quiz_op.cgi` script in QQQ SYSTEMS does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the victim's browser when they access a page created with the vulnerable software. This could lead to:
    - Displaying fake pages to the user.
    - Retrieval of sensitive information such as cookies.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the vulnerable application and redirect users to it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script into the application. The user needs to be tricked into visiting the malicious page.
