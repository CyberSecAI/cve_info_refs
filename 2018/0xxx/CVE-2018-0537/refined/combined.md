# JVN#96655441 QQQ SYSTEMS vulnerable to cross-site scripting

## Overview

QQQ SYSTEMS contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

Note that this vulnerability is different either from [JVN#64990648](/en/jp/JVN64990648/) or [JVN#46471407](/en/jp/JVN46471407/).

## Vendor Information

Developer: Gundam Cult QQQ

Product name and version: QQQ SYSTEMS ver2.24

## Description

QQQ SYSTEMS provided by Gundam Cult QQQ is a CGI script to create quiz pages. `quiz_op.cgi` of QQQ SYSTEMS contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability ([CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)).

When a user accesses a malicious page and is redirected to a page created with the product, an arbitrary script may be executed on the user's browser.

## Impact

A fake page may be shown on a user's browser. Sensitive information may be retrieved such as Cookie data.

## Solution

**Consider stop using QQQ SYSTEMS ver2.24**

Since the developer was unreachable, it is unknown whether any mitigations exist.

## Vendor Opinion

## JPCERT/CC Addendum

During the meeting of Committee for authorizing the disclosure of unresolved vulnerabilities held on November 24, 2015, it was judged that an advisory for this vulnerability shall be disclosed since all the criteria and conditions described below which are stated in [Standards for Handling Software Vulnerability Information and Others (Directive #110, 2014)](http://www.meti.go.jp/policy/netsecurity/downloadfiles/140514kaiseikokuji.pdf) and [Information Security Early Warning Partnership Guideline](https://www.ipa.go.jp/files/000044732.pdf) have been satisfied.

1. The developer of the product is unreachable

   JPCERT/CC had tried to reach the developer for a period of time (more than 9 months) however there were no responses from the developer. Therefore the committee reached the conclusion that it is reasonable and appropriate to judge the developer is unreachable.

   - No response to 6 separate emails (sent from August 5, 2013 to September 2, 2014)

   - No response to disclosure of the developer's name (listed on September 26, 2014) and product name and its version (listed on December 19, 2014) in "[List of unreachable developers](https://jvn.jp/en/reply/)" page on JVN

   - No response to Announcement of screening procedure for vulnerability disclosure (sent on October 26, 2015)

3. Existence of vulnerability has been verified

   IPA verified that the product contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability. Arbitrary script execution on the user's web browser was confirmed which violates the "Integrity" of the product. For verification details, refer to the "Verification" section.

5. Not disclosing this case may result in the risk that product users will have no means to know of the existence of the vulnerability in the product

   In addition, users are permitted to copy, revise, or distribute the product. Therefore, the developer cannot directly contact all users of this product to notify of the cross-site scripting vulnerability. It was determined that disclosure of this vulnerability is legitimate under these conditions.

7. There are no particular reasons that would make disclosure inappropriate

   After considering the developer's stance and the risk to product users, the committee has judged that there are no particular reasons that would make disclosure inappropriate or that disclosure may cause any other issues.
