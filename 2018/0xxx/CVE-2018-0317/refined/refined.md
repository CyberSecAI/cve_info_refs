Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-0317

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Insufficient access control checks in the web interface of Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning (PCP).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Access Control Bypass:** The vulnerability allows an authenticated user to bypass access controls.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  An attacker can modify an access request to promote their account to any role defined on the system. This is due to the lack of proper validation on the access request.
*   **CWE-264:** This vulnerability is associated with the CWE-264, which relates to "Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls".

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged, authenticated attacker can gain higher privileges, potentially administrative level access.
*   **Full compromise:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to promote their account to any role defined on the system, thus providing them with control over the affected systems.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** As the CVSS vector string (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) indicates, the impact of exploitation is high across all three categories: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote, Network-based attack:**  The attacker exploits the vulnerability through the web interface, making it exploitable remotely over a network.
*   **Authenticated attacker:** An attacker needs to be authenticated on the Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning system before being able to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Modified Access Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by modifying an access request in a way that allows the user to gain elevated privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning system.
*   The attacker must be able to send a modified access request through the web interface.

**Affected Products:**
*   Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning (PCP) Releases 12.2 and prior.

**Mitigation:**
*   Upgrade to Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning Releases 12.3 or later.

**Additional Notes:**
*   There are no workarounds available for this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
*   There is no public awareness or known malicious exploitation of the vulnerability.
