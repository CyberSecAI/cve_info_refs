Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2018-0558:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. Specifically, user-supplied input within the "System settings" of Cybozu Mailwise is not properly sanitized or encoded, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application fails to properly neutralize user-supplied input before reflecting it back in the web page, making it susceptible to XSS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts within the context of the user's web browser while they are logged into Cybozu Mailwise. This can lead to a variety of malicious activities including but not limited to:
    - Session hijacking (stealing user cookies or session tokens)
    - Data theft (accessing sensitive data within the application)
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is exploited over the network.
- User Interaction: The attack requires user interaction, such as clicking on a crafted URL or interacting with a specially designed malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL or web page that will be processed by the vulnerable application.
- The attacker doesn't need prior privileges.
- The attacker would need to trick a user into interacting with the malicious link.
