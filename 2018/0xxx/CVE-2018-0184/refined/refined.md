Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-0184:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the CLI parser of Cisco IOS XE Software.
- It stems from the software's failure to properly sanitize command arguments, which can allow access to internal data structures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Input Sanitization:** The core issue is the lack of proper sanitization of command arguments within the CLI parser. This allows a malicious user to inject crafted arguments that bypass intended access restrictions.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting this weakness, an attacker can elevate their privileges to root on the affected device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Root Shell Access:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker access to the underlying Linux shell of the device.
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges, potentially compromising the device and the network it's connected to.
- **Complete System Compromise:**  The ability to run arbitrary code as root allows the attacker to take full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the device via the command line interface (CLI).
- **CLI Command Execution:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by entering crafted commands via the CLI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with privileged EXEC mode (privilege level 15) access to the device.
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the affected device's command line interface to execute the crafted commands.

**Additional Notes:**

- There are no known workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability affects Cisco devices running vulnerable versions of Cisco IOS XE Software.
- Cisco has released software updates that address the vulnerability, and customers are advised to upgrade their software.
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
