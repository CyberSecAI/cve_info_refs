Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0282:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a state condition between the TCP socket state and the Transmission Control Block (TCB) state within the TCP socket code of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inconsistent state management between the socket and its associated TCB.
- Specifically, when a large number of TCP sessions are established and terminated rapidly to the affected device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- The affected device reloads (crashes), interrupting its normal operation.
- Observed to primarily affect HTTP server, potentially affects other TCP applications.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker.
- By sending specific HTTP requests at a sustained rate to a reachable IP address of the affected software.
- A large number of TCP session setups and teardowns.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the vulnerable device.
- Ability to send crafted HTTP requests.
- No authentication is required.
- Must be able to create and tear down TCP connections at a high rate.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a large number of TCP sessions are rapidly established and terminated to the affected device.
- While the vulnerability potentially affects all TCP applications, only the HTTP server has been observed to be affected.
- Controlling or limiting access to the device's HTTP server reduces the exploit likelihood.
- Administrators can mitigate the vulnerability by disabling the HTTP Server feature if not used.
- Limiting access to the HTTP server to trusted networks limits exposure.
- The vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
- A specific message prior to the crash, `%TCP-2-INVALIDTCB: Invalid TCB pointer: 0x3CBC2DF0 -Process= "HTTP CORE", ipl= 0, pid= 334` indicates the device is vulnerable.
