Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0087:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to incorrect FTP user credential validation in the Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper authentication leading to an authentication bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can log in to the FTP server of the affected Cisco WSA device without a valid password, provided they have a valid username.
- Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to the system and potentially allow further malicious activities depending on the system configuration and privileges of the ftp user.
- Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability could be impacted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N) using the FTP protocol.
- The attacker needs to connect to the management IP address of the targeted device using FTP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to reach the management interface of the Cisco WSA device over the network.
- No special privileges are required (PR:N).
- No user interaction is required (UI:N).
- The attacker needs to know a valid username.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability only exists if FTP is enabled on the management interface.
- FTP is disabled by default, so devices with default configurations are not vulnerable.
- The vulnerability affects Cisco AsyncOS for WSA Software version 10.5.1.
- Upgrading to version 10.5.2-042 or later resolves the issue.
- There are no workarounds, but disabling FTP mitigates the vulnerability.
