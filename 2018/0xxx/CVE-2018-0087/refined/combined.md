The attacker does need to have a valid username.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco AsyncOS for WSA Software on both virtual and hardware appliances that are running any release of Cisco AsyncOS 10.5.1 for WSA Software. See the [Fixed Software](#Fixed) section of this security advisory for additional information about the affected software releases.  The device is vulnerable only if FTP is enabled on the management interface. FTP is disabled by default. Determining Whether FTP Is Configured An administrator can determine whether FTP is configured on the management interface by using one of the following three methods.  *First Method to Determine Whether FTP Is Configured*  The administrator can issue the **showconfig** command and check whether the *ftpd* port is configured on the management interface.  ```   ciscowsa> showconfigChoose the password option:1. Mask passwords (Files with masked passwords cannot be loaded using loadconfig command)2. Plain passphrases[1]> 1...            Management      x.x.x.x      Management      24      xxx.xxx.xxx      21...   ```  *Second Method to Determine Whether FTP Is Configured*  The administrator can check the FTP configuration by issuing the **ifconfig** command. In this example, the management interface is configured for FTP. The *Y* value in square brackets represents the current configuration.  ```   ciscowsa> ifconfig...Choose the operation you want to perform:- NEW - Create a new interface.- EDIT - Modify an interface.- DELETE - Remove an interface.- DETAILS - Show details of an interface.> EDITEnter the number of the interface you wish to edit.[]> 1..Do you want to enable FTP on this interface? [Y]>...   ```  *Third Method to Determine Whether FTP Is Configured* The administrator can also use the GUI to check the FTP configuration by navigating to **Network** > **Interfaces** > **Appliance Management Services** and determining whether the **FTP** check box is checked.   Determining the WSA Software Release To determine whether a vulnerable release of Cisco AsyncOS Software is running on a Cisco WSA, administrators can use the **version** command in the WSA CLI. The following example shows the results for an appliance that is running Cisco AsyncOS Software Release 10.5.1-296:  ```   ciscowsa> versionCurrent Version===============Product: Cisco IronPort S670 Web Security ApplianceModel: S670Version: 10.5.1-296...   ``` Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.      The following products are not affected by this vulnerability:   + Email Security Appliance (ESA), both virtual and hardware versions   + Security Mail Appliance (SMA), both virtual and hardware versions  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, this vulnerability exists only when FTP is enabled on the management interface. If FTP is disabled, this vulnerability does not exist; therefore, disabling FTP is considered a mitigation for the vulnerability.   Disabling FTP on the Management Interface An administrator can disable FTP on the management interface by using one of the following two methods.  *First Method to Disable FTP on the Management Interface*  The administrator can disable FTP by issuing the **ifconfig** command to edit the management interface configuration and then issuing the **commit** command to commit the change.  ```   ciscowsa> ifconfig...Choose the operation you want to perform:- NEW - Create a new interface.- EDIT - Modify an interface.- DELETE - Remove an interface.- DETAILS - Show details of an interface.> EDITEnter the number of the interface you wish to edit.[]> 1..Do you want to enable FTP on this interface? [Y]> N...Choose the operation you want to perform:- NEW - Create a new interface.- EDIT - Modify an interface.- DELETE - Remove an interface.- DETAILS - Show details of an interface.[]> ciscowsa> commitWarning: In order to process these changes, the proxy process will restart after Commit. This will cause a brief interruption in service. Additionally, the authentication cache will be cleared, which might require some users to authenticate again.Warning: Processing of network configuration changes might cause a brief interruption in network availability.Please enter some comments describing your changes:[]> disable FTPChanges committed...   ```  *Second Method to Disable FTP on the Management Interface*  The administrator can disable FTP from the GUI by navigating to **Network** > **Interfaces** > **Appliance Management Services** and unchecking the **FTP** check box, then clicking **Submit** to commit the change.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:   [http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN\_.html](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html)  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner.

| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 7.3 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 7.3 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 7.3 |
