Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability detailed in CVE-2018-0498:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how mbedtls (and its predecessor polarssl) handles TLS-CBC padding during decryption, specifically regarding how it sets the `padlen` variable for invalid padding. When padding is invalid, `padlen` is set to 0. The length of the input to the HMAC function then becomes information that can be used to differentiate between valid and invalid padding.
- The vulnerability further resides in the fact that MD/SHA padding is read from a static buffer. The amount of padding used can be deduced from a cache attack targeting that buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Side-channel vulnerability:** The length of input to the HMAC function (which is derived from padding information), leaks through how much MD/SHA padding is used. A local attacker could exploit this using a cache timing attack.
- **Information Leak:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to gain information about the validity and length of padding, thus giving insight into the encrypted data itself.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Plaintext recovery:** A local attacker can potentially recover partial plaintext for CBC-based ciphersuites by exploiting the information leaked through the cache timing attack.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Local cache timing attack:** A local attacker, with the ability to observe cache timing differences, can glean information about the padding length being used during decryption by monitoring the access to the static buffer which is used to store the amount of padding used in MD/SHA hashes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the same system to perform cache timing attacks.
- **Knowledge of cryptographic implementations:** The attacker needs knowledge of how CBC padding and the HMAC function are implemented to successfully exploit this vulnerability.
- **Targeting vulnerable software**: The attacker must be able to target software that is using the vulnerable versions of mbedtls or polarssl.
