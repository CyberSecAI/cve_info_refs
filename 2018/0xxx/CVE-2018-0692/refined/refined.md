Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The Baidu Browser installer has a flaw in its DLL search path, causing it to load dynamic link libraries in an insecure manner. This is a classic case of a DLL hijacking vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insecure DLL Loading (CWE-427):** The installer doesn't properly validate the location from which it loads DLL files. This allows an attacker to place a malicious DLL in a location where the installer will find it and load it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By loading a malicious DLL, an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the user running the installer. This could lead to a complete compromise of the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system to place the malicious DLL file.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The user must run the vulnerable installer for the attack to succeed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL file in a location where the Baidu Browser installer will find it. This usually involves tricking the user or exploiting another vulnerability to gain the necessary write access.
*   The attacker must entice a user to execute the Baidu Browser installer.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Baidu Browser version 43.23.1000.500 and earlier.
*   The vendor recommends that users stop using the installer, as development and support for Baidu Browser has been discontinued.
*   The provided content includes both CVSS v3 and v2 scores, which help assess the severity of the vulnerability.
*   The analysis assumes that the user is tricked into placing a malicious DLL file prepared by an attacker in a specific folder.
