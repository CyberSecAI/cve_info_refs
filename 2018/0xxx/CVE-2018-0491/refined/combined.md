# New stable Tor releases, with security fixes and DoS prevention: 0.3.2.10, 0.3.1.10, 0.2.9.15

by nickm | March 3, 2018

![](../static/images/lead.png)

Today, we made several new stable Tor releases.Â  Together, they fix an issue in directory authorities, and backport a feature to improve relays' resistance of denial-of-service attacks. In addition, the 0.3.2.10 release fixes a security bug affecting relays running earlier 0.3.2.x versions.

To summarize:

* Relays (and bridges) running 0.3.2.1-alpha through 0.3.2.9 should upgrade.
* Directory authorities should upgrade.
* Relays (and bridges) running 0.3.3.1-alpha should upgrade.
* All other relays (and bridges) *may* wish to upgrade in order to improve their

  resistance to denial-of-service attacks.

If you build Tor from source, you can fetch the latest source code from <https://dist.torproject.org/>. New packages for relays should be available in the coming days.

The 0.3.2.10 changelog is below. For the changes in 0.2.9.15 and 0.3.1.10, please see the ChangeLog file distributed along with the source code. The changes in 0.3.3.3-alpha will be listed in my next blog post.

---

Tor 0.3.2.10 is the second stable release in the 0.3.2 series. It backports a number of bugfixes, including important fixes for security issues.

It includes an important security fix for a remote crash attack against directory authorities, tracked as TROVE-2018-001.

Additionally, it backports a fix for a bug whose severity we have upgraded: Bug [24700](https://bugs.torproject.org/24700), which was fixed in 0.3.3.2-alpha, can be remotely triggered in order to crash relays with a use-after-free pattern. As such, we are now tracking that bug as TROVE-2018-002 and CVE-2018-0491, and backporting it to earlier releases. This bug affected versions 0.3.2.1-alpha through 0.3.2.9, as well as version 0.3.3.1-alpha.

This release also backports our new system for improved resistance to denial-of-service attacks against relays.

This release also fixes several minor bugs and annoyances from earlier releases.

Relays running 0.3.2.x SHOULD upgrade to one of the versions released today, for the fix to TROVE-2018-002. Directory authorities should also upgrade. (Relays on earlier versions might want to update too for the DoS mitigations.)

## Changes in version 0.3.2.10 - 2018-03-03

* Major bugfixes (denial-of-service, directory authority, backport from 0.3.3.3-alpha):
  + Fix a protocol-list handling bug that could be used to remotely crash directory authorities with a null-pointer exception. Fixes bug [25074](https://bugs.torproject.org/25074); bugfix on 0.2.9.4-alpha. Also tracked as TROVE-2018-001 and CVE-2018-0490.
* Major bugfixes (scheduler, KIST, denial-of-service, backport from 0.3.3.2-alpha):
  + Avoid adding the same channel twice in the KIST scheduler pending list, which could lead to remote denial-of-service use-after-free attacks against relays. Fixes bug [24700](https://bugs.torproject.org/24700); bugfix on 0.3.2.1-alpha.

Â

* Major features (denial-of-service mitigation, backport from 0.3.3.2-alpha):
  + Give relays some defenses against the recent network overload. We start with three defenses (default parameters in parentheses). First: if a single client address makes too many concurrent connections (>100), hang up on further connections. Second: if a single client address makes circuits too quickly (more than 3 per second, with an allowed burst of 90) while also having too many connections open (3), refuse new create cells for the next while (1-2 hours). Third: if a client asks to establish a rendezvous point to you directly, ignore the request. These defenses can be manually controlled by new torrc options, but relays will also take guidance from consensus parameters, so there's no need to configure anything manually. Implements ticket [24902](https://bugs.torproject.org/24902).
* Major bugfixes (onion services, retry behavior, backport from 0.3.3.1-alpha):
  + Fix an "off by 2" error in counting rendezvous failures on the onion service side. While we thought we would stop the rendezvous attempt after one failed circuit, we were actually making three circuit attempts before giving up. Now switch to a default of 2, and allow the consensus parameter "hs\_service\_max\_rdv\_failures" to override. Fixes bug [24895](https://bugs.torproject.org/24895); bugfix on 0.0.6.
  + New-style (v3) onion services now obey the "max rendezvous circuit attempts" logic. Previously they would make as many rendezvous circuit attempts as they could fit in the MAX\_REND\_TIMEOUT second window before giving up. Fixes bug [24894](https://bugs.torproject.org/24894); bugfix on 0.3.2.1-alpha.
* Major bugfixes (protocol versions, backport from 0.3.3.2-alpha):
  + Add Link protocol version 5 to the supported protocols list. Fixes bug [25070](https://bugs.torproject.org/25070); bugfix on 0.3.1.1-alpha.
* Major bugfixes (relay, backport from 0.3.3.1-alpha):
  + Fix a set of false positives where relays would consider connections to other relays as being client-only connections (and thus e.g. deserving different link padding schemes) if those relays fell out of the consensus briefly. Now we look only at the initial handshake and whether the connection authenticated as a relay. Fixes bug [24898](https://bugs.torproject.org/24898); bugfix on 0.3.1.1-alpha.
* Major bugfixes (scheduler, consensus, backport from 0.3.3.2-alpha):
  + The scheduler subsystem was failing to promptly notice changes in consensus parameters, making it harder to switch schedulers network-wide. Fixes bug [24975](https://bugs.torproject.org/24975); bugfix on 0.3.2.1-alpha.
* Minor features (denial-of-service avoidance, backport from 0.3.3.2-alpha):
  + Make our OOM handler aware of the geoip client history cache so it doesn't fill up the memory. This check is important for IPv6 and our DoS mitigation subsystem. Closes ticket [25122](https://bugs.torproject.org/25122).
* Minor features (compatibility, OpenSSL, backport from 0.3.3.3-alpha):
  + Tor will now support TLS1.3 once OpenSSL 1.1.1 is released. Previous versions of Tor would not have worked with OpenSSL 1.1.1, since they neither disabled TLS 1.3 nor enabled any of the ciphersuites it requires. Now we enable the TLS 1.3 ciphersuites. Closes ticket [24978](https://bugs.torproject.org/24978).
* Minor features (geoip):
  + Update geoip and geoip6 to the February 7 2018 Maxmind GeoLite2 Country database.
* Minor features (logging, diagnostic, backport from 0.3.3.2-alpha):
  + When logging a failure to check a hidden service's certificate, also log what the problem with the certificate was. Diagnostic for ticket [24972](https://bugs.torproject.org/24972).
* Minor bugfix (channel connection, backport from 0.3.3.2-alpha):
  + Use the actual observed address of an incoming relay connection, not the canonical address of the relay from its descriptor, when making decisions about how to handle the incoming connection. Fixes bug [24952](https://bugs.torproject.org/24952); bugfix on 0.2.4.11-alpha. Patch by "ffmancera".
* Minor bugfixes (denial-of-service, backport from 0.3.3.3-alpha):
  + Fix a possible crash on malformed consensus. If a consensus had contained an unparseable protocol line, it could have made clients and relays crash with a null-pointer exception. To exploit this issue, however, an attacker would need to be able to subvert the directory authority system. Fixes bug [25251](https://bugs.torproject.org/25251); bugfix on 0.2.9.4-alpha. Also tracked as TROVE-2018-004.
* Minor bugfix (directory authority, backport from 0.3.3.2-alpha):
  + Directory authorities, when refusing a descriptor from a rejected relay, now explicitly tell the relay (in its logs) to set a valid ContactInfo address and contact the bad-relays@ mailing list. Fixes bug [25170](https://bugs.torproject.org/25170); bugfix on 0.2.9.1.
* Minor bugfixes (build, rust, backport from 0.3.3.1-alpha):
  + When building with Rust on OSX, link against libresolv, to work around the issue at <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/46797>. Fixes bug [24652](https://bugs.torproject.org/24652); bugfix on 0.3.1.1-alpha.
* Minor bugfixes (onion services, backport from 0.3.3.2-alpha):
  + Remove a BUG() statement when a client fetches an onion descriptor that has a lower revision counter than the one in its cache. This can happen in normal circumstances due to HSDir desync. Fixes bug [24976](https://bugs.torproject.org/24976); bugfix on 0.3.2.1-alpha.
* Minor bugfixes (logging, backport from 0.3.3.2-alpha):
  + Don't treat inability to store a cached consensus object as a bug: it can happen normally when we are out of disk space. Fixes bug [24859](https://bugs.torproject.org/24859); bugfix on 0.3.1.1-alpha.
* Minor bugfixes (performance, fragile-hardening, backport from 0.3.3.1-alpha):
  + Improve the performance of our consensus-diff application code when Tor is built with the --enable-fragile-hardening option set. Fixes bug [24826](https://bugs.torproject.org/24826); bugfix on 0.3.1.1-alpha.
* Minor bugfixes (OSX, backport from 0.3.3.1-alpha):
  + Don't exit the Tor process if setrlimit() fails to change the file limit (which can happen sometimes on some versions of OSX). Fixes bug [21074](https://bugs.torproject.org/21074); bugfix on 0.0.9pre5.
* Minor bugfixes (spec conformance, backport from 0.3.3.3-alpha):
  + Forbid "-0" as a protocol version. Fixes part of bug [25249](https://bugs.torproject.org/25249); bugfix on 0.2.9.4-alpha.
  + Forbid UINT32\_MAX as a protocol version. Fixes part of bug [25249](https://bugs.torproject.org/25249); bugfix on 0.2.9.4-alpha.
* Minor bugfixes (testing, backport from 0.3.3.1-alpha):
  + Fix a memory leak in the scheduler/loop\_kist unit test. Fixes bug [25005](https://bugs.torproject.org/25005); bugfix on 0.3.2.7-rc.
* Minor bugfixes (v3 onion services, backport from 0.3.3.2-alpha):
  + Look at the "HSRend" protocol version, not the "HSDir" protocol version, when deciding whether a consensus entry can support the v3 onion service protocol as a rendezvous point. Fixes bug [25105](https://bugs.torproject.org/25105); bugfix on 0.3.2.1-alpha.
* Code simplification and refactoring (backport from 0.3.3.3-alpha):
  + Update the "rust dependencies" submodule to be a project-level repository, rather than a user repository. Closes ticket [25323](https://bugs.torproject.org/25323).
* Documentation (backport from 0.3.3.1-alpha):
  + Document that operators who run more than one relay or bridge are expected to set MyFamily and ContactInfo correctly. Closes ticket [24526](https://bugs.torproject.org/24526).

### [what happened in v3 hiddenâ¦](#comment-274202)

what happened in v3 hidden service???

tor just look for 3!!! not 4 hops, change in spec.????

[debug] onion\_extend\_cpath(): Path is 2 long; we want 3

compared to original hidden service

[debug] onion\_extend\_cpath(): Path is 3 long; we want 4

BIG PROBLEM!!!

after re-testing with 0.3.2.9, it is confirmed, there is somthing WRONG in v3 hidden service in the latest version (0.3.2.10)

0.3.2.10 reduce to 3 hops (0.3.2.9 or earlier used 4 hops) when client connecting to v3 hidden service

That's BAD

### [improving relay's resistanceâ¦](#comment-274203)

improving relay's resistance at a dos attack : what is the difference with a dos attack at the relay & at the site (whatever its name/address) ?

is it not the same thing ? i mean , on the onion-network , a relay is the first wall then the config of the site in second no ?

### [I realize that windows usersâ¦](#comment-274828)

I realize that windows users of tor (not torbrowser) are now untouchables, but for those of us that have no choice but to use windows in certain situations, would it be to much to ask to at least put copies of the win32 files in the win32 directory? That way we don't have to keep looking in different places to see if it has been released yet. For example, I don't know if a win32 executable for 0.2.9.15 has been released and I can't find it, or it simply won't be released.

I do appreciate the work that torproject does.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# sched: With KIST, a channel can be added more than once in the pending list

Here is the flow for this to happen (and it has been observed):

The scheduler flushes 100 bytes onto the outbuf of a channel. Then the channel it put in the re-add list (which is to add back the channel in the pending list at the *end* of the scheduler loop) because it can't write anymore. Its state is set to `waiting_to_write`.

We then handle the next channel in the main loop but before that we'll try to write to kernel the outbuf of the previous channel which is in the re-add list.

If the outbuf is fully drained, `scheduler_channel_wants_writes()` is called which will add the channel back in the pending list *IF* it is in the `waiting_to_write` state which it is because it was set to that state just before being added to the re-add list.

Scheduler loop ends and we end up with twice the channel in the pending list. This can go on for a while resulting in the same channel being added many more times.

There are two ways to fix that, one quick and one more logical.

1. The quick one is to let the state of the channel in PENDING mode (which is what Vanilla does) before adding it to the re-add list. That way, it won't get added back in the pending list by any callbacks.
2. Originally, the assumption was that KIST takes care of the write on the socket and only KIST. But the reality is different, KIST will trigger writes to the kernel but anything after that, any errors or retry is handled by libevent `write_event` ([#24448 (moved)](/legacy/trac/-/issues/24448 "Channeltls adds the connection write event to main loop when writing a packed cell"), and [#24449 (moved)](/legacy/trac/-/issues/24449 "sched: KIST scheduler should handle limited or failed connection write")).

So, it doesn't make sense for KIST to reschedule the channel as pending if it is waiting to write on the socket because from that point on, it will be the job of libevent to actually flush it with its `poll(POLLOUT)` feature. Thus the fix is to never add back a channel that is waiting to write.

I personally would like to have (2) for two reasons. First, we would save CPU time and useless syscalls in this fast path. Second, adding a channel that is waiting to write back into the pending list is not really good in terms of priority. It should not get considered for another round in the loop, it should simply wait until the socket has been written since the assumption in (2) is false in the first place.

# Resolve TROVE-2018-002: bug 24700 KIST use-after-free can be remotely triggered

The use-after free KIST bug that we fixed as [#24700 (moved)](/legacy/trac/-/issues/24700 "sched: With KIST, a channel can be added more than once in the pending list") can, it turns out, be triggered remotely, causing relays to crash.

This bug only affects relays and bridges, and only if they are running 0.3.2.1-alpha through 0.3.2.9, or 0.3.3.1-alpha. It is fixed in 0.3.2.10 and 0.3.3.2-alpha.

Tracked as TROVE-2018-002 and CVE-2018-0491.

### Get connected

If you are in a country where Tor is blocked, you can configure Tor to connect to a bridge during the setup process.

If Tor is not censored, one of the most common reasons Tor won't connect is an incorrect system clock. Please make sure it's set correctly.
