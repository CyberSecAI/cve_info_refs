Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-0356:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from **insufficient input validation** of certain parameters passed to the affected Cisco WebEx software via HTTP GET and HTTP POST methods.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: The lack of proper input validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary script or HTML code into a user's browser. This is a reflected XSS vulnerability.
*   **CWE-79**:  The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-79, which refers to improper neutralization of input during web page generation ('Cross-site Scripting').

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary script or HTML code in the user's browser within the context of the affected site. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the web page
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Theft of sensitive information

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:**  An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without needing any prior authentication.
*  **User Interaction Required:** The attacker needs to convince the victim to click on a malicious link.
*   **HTTP GET and HTTP POST Methods:** The vulnerability is triggered through parameters passed via these methods.
*   **Network (AV:N):**  The attack can be launched over a network.
*   **Low Attack Complexity (AC:L):** The vulnerability is easily exploitable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious link containing the XSS payload.
*   The attacker needs to distribute this link to the intended victim.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** Cisco WebEx (including Cisco WebEx Meeting Center and Cisco Webex Meetings). Specific affected software releases can be found through the Cisco bug ID CSCvi63757.
*   **Workarounds:** There are no workarounds available. Users must apply the official patch from Cisco.
*  **CVSS Score:** Base score of 6.1 (Medium) with vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
*   **Exploitation Status:** Cisco PSIRT was not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability at the time of the advisory.
* **Reported By**: Adam Willard reported the vulnerability to Cisco.
