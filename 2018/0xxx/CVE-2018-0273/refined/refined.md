Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-0273:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by the improper processing of corrupted Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) messages by the IPsec Manager in Cisco StarOS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation of IKEv2 messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- Specifically, it causes the `ipsecmgr` service to reload.
- This reload terminates all active IPsec VPN tunnels.
- It prevents new IPsec tunnels from being established until the service restarts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attacker can send crafted IKEv2 messages towards an affected router.
- The attack is network-based (AV:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any authentication or privileges (PR:N).
- The attacker does not require any user interaction (UI:N).
- The attacker can be positioned anywhere on the network.
- The vulnerability can be triggered with low complexity (AC:L).

**Additional Details:**
- Affected products include Cisco Aggregation Services Router (ASR) 5000 Series Routers and Virtualized Packet Core (VPC) System Software, when they are running Cisco StarOS.
- There are no workarounds available to mitigate this vulnerability.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
- The CVSS v3 score is 5.3 (Medium) with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L
- The CWE is CWE-399
