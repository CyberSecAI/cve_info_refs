Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Cybozu Dezie processes parameters within HTTP requests, specifically related to path handling. This allows for directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Directory Traversal (CWE-22):** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in HTTP requests, enabling attackers to navigate outside the intended directory structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to delete arbitrary files on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is **Network**. This implies the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over a network connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication (login) to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attack complexity is **low**, indicating that the exploitation process is relatively straightforward.
- The attacker doesn't need any user interaction to trigger the vulnerability

**Affected Products:**
- Cybozu Dezie versions 8.0.2 to 8.1.2 are affected by this vulnerability.
