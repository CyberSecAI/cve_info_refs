  "CVE-2018-0780": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability exists in the `AsmJSByteCodeGenerator::EmitCall` function within the Chakra JavaScript engine of Microsoft Edge. This function doesn't validate if an array identifier is used as the callee. It handles invalid calls such as `arr[idx & ...]()` the same as valid calls. In these cases, the index register remains `NoRegister` which is `(uint32_t)-1`, leading to an out-of-bounds read.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The `AsmJSByteCodeGenerator::EmitCall` function lacks proper validation when handling calls involving array identifiers as callees, resulting in an out-of-bounds read.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Out-of-bounds read"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to the out-of-bounds read.",
      "attack_vectors": "By crafting malicious JavaScript code that uses an array identifier as a callee.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code within Microsoft Edge."
