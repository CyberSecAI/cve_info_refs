Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `nt!RtlpCopyLegacyContextX86` function, specifically during the copying of the `_FLOATING_SAVE_AREA` structure when the `CONTEXT_FLOATING_POINT` flag is set. The `Spare0` field within this structure is not initialized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Uninitialized Memory:** The `Spare0` field (a 32-bit value) within the `_FLOATING_SAVE_AREA` structure is left uninitialized when copied to user mode memory. This results in a kernel stack memory disclosure.
- **Missing Initialization:** In Windows 8 and 10, the memory region obtained via `alloca()` is not zeroed out, unlike in Windows 7 where `memset()` is used for initialization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Memory Disclosure:** An attacker can read 4 bytes of uninitialized kernel stack memory, potentially exposing sensitive information, including kernel ASLR base addresses and other secrets.
- **Bypass Exploit Mitigations:** By repeatedly triggering this vulnerability, an attacker could gather enough information to bypass exploit mitigations like kernel ASLR and potentially execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **`GetThreadContext()` System Call:** The vulnerability can be triggered by calling the `GetThreadContext()` function with the `CONTEXT_FLOATING_POINT` flag set, leading to the copy of the uninitialized `Spare0` field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system to execute code and trigger the `GetThreadContext()` system call.
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user on the system to call the necessary Windows API.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present on Windows 8 and 10, while Windows 7 is not affected due to a `memset()` call that zeros the memory region.
- The provided code snippet demonstrates stack spraying, which fills the kernel stack with predictable data (0x41), making the uninitialized memory disclosure more obvious during exploitation.
- The vulnerability is a variant of previously reported bugs involving CONTEXT structure copying (issues #1177 and #1311).

This report contains more detail than the official CVE description, specifically regarding the root cause within `RtlpCopyLegacyContextX86`, the specifics of the uninitialized `Spare0` field, and the stack spraying technique. It also highlights the difference in behavior between Windows 7 and later versions.
