         "additional_details": "The vulnerability affects only NX-OS devices configured with IGMP Snooping functionality. This vulnerability applies to IGMP snooping sent over either IP version 4 (IPv4) or IP version 6 (IPv6). On certain NX-OS hardware platforms, IGMP Snooping is enabled by default and will not be explicitly shown in the running configuration. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
