"title": "Summary",
"text": "A vulnerability in the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) Snooping feature of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code and gain full control of an affected system. The attacker could also cause an affected system to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow condition in the IGMP Snooping subsystem. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IGMP packets to an affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code and gain full control of the affected system or cause the affected system to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180620-nxosigmp [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180620-nxosigmp\"]\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the June 2018 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Collection, which includes 24 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 24 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: June 2018 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Collection [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-67770\"]."

"text": "This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco NX-OS Software:\r\n\r\nNexus 2000 Series Switches\r\nNexus 3000 Series Switches\r\nNexus 3500 Platform Switches\r\nNexus 3600 Platform Switches\r\nNexus 5500 Platform Switches\r\nNexus 5600 Platform Switches\r\nNexus 6000 Series Switches\r\nNexus 7000 Series Switches\r\nNexus 7700 Series Switches\r\nNexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode\r\nNexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco NX-OS Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n Determining if the NX-OS Software Is Vulnerable\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability affects only NX-OS devices configured with IGMP Snooping functionality. This vulnerability applies to IGMP snooping sent over either IP version 4 (IPv4) or IP version 6 (IPv6).\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a Nexus device is configured with IGMP snooping, administrators can use the show running-config | include \"ip igmp snooping\" command from the NX-OS CLI and verify that the feature is enabled. If the command returns ip igmp snooping as output, the device is vulnerable. The following example shows the IGMP Snooping feature enabled on a device running NX-OS Software:\r\n\r\nnxos-switch# show running-config | include \"ip igmp snooping\"\r\nip igmp snooping\r\n\r\nNote: On certain NX-OS hardware platforms, IGMP Snooping is enabled by default and will not be explicitly shown in the running configuration. Please refer to https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus3000/sw/multicast/503\_u5\_1/multicast\_cli/igmp\_snoop.pdf [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus3000/sw/multicast/503\_u5\_1/multicast\_cli/igmp\_snoop.pdf\"].\r\n Determining the Cisco NX-OS Software Release\r\nAdministrators can check the release of Cisco NX-OS Software that is running on a device by using the show version command in the device CLI. The following example shows the output of this command on a device that is running Cisco NX-OS Software Release 7.3(2)D1(1):\r\n\r\n\r\nnxos-switch# show version\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco Nexus Operating System (NX-OS) Software\r\nTAC support: http://www.cisco.com/tac Documents: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps9372/tsd\_products\_support\_series\_home.html Copyright (c) 2002-2017, Cisco Systems, Inc.

The attacker could also cause an affected system to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.      This advisory is available at the following link:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180620-nxosigmp>  This advisory is part of the June 2018 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Collection, which includes 24 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 24 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: June 2018 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Collection](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-67770).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThis vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco NX-OS Software:   + Nexus 2000 Series Switches   + Nexus 3000 Series Switches   + Nexus 3500 Platform Switches   + Nexus 3600 Platform Switches   + Nexus 5500 Platform Switches   + Nexus 5600 Platform Switches   + Nexus 6000 Series Switches   + Nexus 7000 Series Switches   + Nexus 7700 Series Switches   + Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode   + Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode   For information about which Cisco NX-OS Software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. **Determining if the NX-OS Software Is Vulnerable**      The vulnerability affects only NX-OS devices configured with IGMP Snooping functionality. This vulnerability applies to IGMP snooping sent over either IP version 4 (IPv4) or IP version 6 (IPv6).      To determine whether a Nexus device is configured with IGMP snooping, administrators can use the **show running-config | include "ip igmp snooping"** command from the NX-OS CLI and verify that the feature is enabled. If the command returns **ip igmp snooping** as output, the device is vulnerable. The following example shows the IGMP Snooping feature enabled on a device running NX-OS Software: ```   nxos-switch# show running-config | include "ip igmp snooping"   ip igmp snooping   ```  **Note**: On certain NX-OS hardware platforms, IGMP Snooping is enabled by default and will not be explicitly shown in the running configuration. Please refer to <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus3000/sw/multicast/503_u5_1/multicast_cli/igmp_snoop.pdf>. Determining the Cisco NX-OS Software Release Administrators can check the release of Cisco NX-OS Software that is running on a device by using the **show version** command in the device CLI. The following example shows the output of this command on a device that is running Cisco NX-OS Software Release 7.3(2)D1(1):  ```   nxos-switch# show version   ```  ```   Cisco Nexus Operating System (NX-OS) Software   TAC support: http://www.cisco.com/tac   Documents: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps9372/tsd_products_support_series_home.html   Copyright (c) 2002-2017, Cisco Systems, Inc.

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Firepower 2100 Series   + Firepower 4100 Series Next-Generation Firewall   + Firepower 9300 Security Appliance   + MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches   + Nexus 1000V Series Switches   + Nexus 1100 Series Cloud Services Platforms   + Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules   + UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects Cisco has not investigated whether this vulnerability affects Cisco Nexus 4000 Series Switches, Cisco Nexus 5010 Switches, or Cisco Nexus 5020 Switches because those products have reached end-of-life status. For more information, refer to the [End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement for the Cisco Nexus 4000 Series Switch Modules for IBM BladeCenter](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/nexus-4000-series-switches/eos-eol-notice-c51-733205.html) and the [End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement for the Cisco Nexus 5010 and Nexus 5020 Switches](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/nexus-5000-series-switches/eol_c51-709037.html).  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:   [http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN\_.html](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html)  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 8.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.8 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 8.8 |
