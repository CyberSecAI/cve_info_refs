Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-0134

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the RADIUS authentication module of Cisco Policy Suite returning different authentication failure messages depending on whether the username provided is a valid subscriber username.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** The system reveals information about the validity of usernames through differing error messages during RADIUS authentication. This is a type of information leakage vulnerability.
*   **CWE-200:** This vulnerability maps to CWE-200, which is "Information Exposure."

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An unauthenticated, remote attacker can use the different error messages to enumerate valid subscriber usernames.
*   The attacker could then use these valid usernames in subsequent attacks against the system, potentially gaining unauthorized access or performing other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Network Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over a network without any prior authentication or user interaction.
*   The attacker sends RADIUS authentication requests to the Cisco Policy Suite server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need any credentials or prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the affected Cisco Policy Suite server to send RADIUS requests.

**Summary of the vulnerability:** The Cisco Policy Suite RADIUS server's behavior of providing different error messages for valid and invalid usernames allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to enumerate valid user accounts, which could be leveraged in further malicious activities.

**Additional details from the provided documents:**
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 (Medium) with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N. This indicates the attack requires no special access rights, is easily exploitable and leads to limited information disclosure.
*   **Workarounds:** There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects Cisco Policy Suite.
*   **Fixed Software:** Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability, referencing the bug ID CSCvg47830.
*   **Exploitation:** At the time of the advisory, there were no known public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
