Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-0384:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the Cisco FireSIGHT System Software's incorrect handling of TCP packets received out of order, specifically when a TCP SYN retransmission occurs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Improper handling of out-of-order TCP packets, particularly during SYN retransmissions.
*   This leads to a bypass of URL-based access control policies.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can bypass URL-based access control policies designed to block traffic.
*   This could potentially allow unauthorized access to resources or services that should be restricted.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack is carried out remotely over a network.
*   It involves sending a maliciously crafted TCP connection through an affected device.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by sending out-of-order TCP packets and a TCP SYN retransmission.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a device running the affected Cisco FireSIGHT System Software.
*   The attacker does not need any prior authentication or privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to craft specific TCP packets to trigger the vulnerability.
