Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-0247:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an incorrect implementation of authentication for WebAuth clients in a specific configuration on Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers (WLC) and Aironet Access Points running Cisco IOS Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability for an attacker to bypass the WebAuth authentication process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Network Access:** A successful exploit allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to pass traffic to local network resources without going through the required authentication.
*   **Compromise of Integrity:** The impact includes the possibility of integrity compromise as attacker can send unauthorized traffic.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Adjacent Network:** The attacker needs to be in an adjacent network to exploit this vulnerability. This implies being within the local network's range.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Adjacent Network Access:**  The attacker needs to be within the local network vicinity.
*   **No prior authentication required:**  The attacker does not need to authenticate prior to sending malicious traffic, which is the core of the bypass.

**Vulnerable Configuration:**

The vulnerability is only present under the following specific configuration:

1.  The Access Point (AP) is configured in FlexConnect Mode with NAT.
2.  The WLAN is configured for central switching, meaning the client is being assigned a unique IP address.
3.  The AP is configured with a Split Tunnel access control list (ACL) for access to local network resources, meaning the AP is doing the NAT on the connection.
4.  The client is using WebAuth.
5. The vulnerability does not affect .1x clients.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as **Medium** severity.
*   There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability other than the official software updates provided by Cisco.
*   The Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public exploitation of this vulnerability.
