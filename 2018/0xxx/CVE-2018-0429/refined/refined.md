Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation within the Cisco Thor decoder when parsing a bitstream. Specifically, it fails to properly validate the input before processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The lack of input validation allows a crafted, non-conformant Thor bitstream to cause a stack-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can lead to a segmentation fault, causing a denial of service.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The stack overflow can potentially be leveraged to inject and execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is local. This means that an attacker needs to be able to run the vulnerable code on the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable Thor decoder is running.
*   **Crafted Input:** The attacker must be able to provide a specially crafted, non-conformant Thor bitstream as input to the decoder.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability is located in the `dec/decode_block.c` and `dec/read_bits.c` files.
* The fix involves adding input validation to prevent the stack overflow.
* The commit `18de8f9f0762c3a542b1122589edb8af859d9813` addresses this issue by adding a check on size in `dec/decode_block.c` and limiting the log2_sb_size in `dec/read_bits.c`.
* The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.8, categorized as High severity.

This information is more detailed than the basic CVE description, providing the specific files involved, the nature of the input, and the code changes that address the issue.
