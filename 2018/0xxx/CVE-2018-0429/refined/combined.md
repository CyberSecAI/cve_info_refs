## Description

Stack-based buffer overflow in the Cisco Thor decoder before commit 18de8f9f0762c3a542b1122589edb8af859d9813 allows local users to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) and execute arbitrary code via a crafted non-conformant Thor bitstream.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Fix possible stack overflows in decoder for illegal bit streams

Fixes [CVE-2018-0429](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-ch62-f82x-q5p8 "CVE-2018-0429")
A vulnerability in the Thor decoder (available at:
<https://github.com/cisco/thor>) could allow an authenticated, local
attacker to cause segmentation faults and stack overflows when using a
non-conformant Thor bitstream as input.
The vulnerability is due to lack of input validation when parsing the
bitstream. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a
stack overflow and potentially inject and execute arbitrary code.

# Thor Video Codec

Implementation of <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-fuldseth-netvc-thor>

## Build

Windows: Use Visual Studio with build/Thor.sln.

Mac/Linux:

```
make -j8

```

Binaries will appear in the build/ directory.

## Usage

encoder: Thorenc -cf config.txt -if in.yuv -of str.bit -rf out.yuv -qp N -width [width] -height [height] -f [framerate] -stat out.stat -qp [quant] -n [num frames]

A y4m file can be provided for input, and it will override width, height and framerate values given on the command-line.

decoder: Thordec str.bit out.dec.yuv
