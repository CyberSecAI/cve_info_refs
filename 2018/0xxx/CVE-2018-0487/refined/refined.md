Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-0487:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how mbed TLS handles crafted certificate chains during RSASSA-PSS signature verification within a TLS or DTLS session. The root cause is related to mishandling of the certificate chain. Specifically, a buffer overflow is triggered in the process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the RSASSA-PSS signature verification process when handling a maliciously crafted certificate chain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the vulnerable process.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service condition due to application crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
*   **Crafted Certificate Chain:** The primary attack vector involves a crafted or malicious certificate chain.
*   **TLS/DTLS Session:** The vulnerable code is invoked during a TLS or DTLS session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to establish a TLS or DTLS connection.
*   **Crafting Malicious Certificate Chain:** The attacker needs the ability to create and present a malicious certificate chain during the handshake process.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in mbed TLS, a lightweight crypto and SSL/TLS library.
*   Multiple sources, including Debian and Gentoo, confirm the vulnerability and recommend upgrading to patched versions.
*   The vulnerability is also present in the related polarssl library, as mbedtls is a fork of polarssl.
*   Ubuntu has issued a security notice (USN-4267-1) addressing this and other mbed TLS vulnerabilities.
*   The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 4138-1 and DSA 4147-1) covers this vulnerability as well.

This vulnerability is rated as "high" severity by Gentoo.
