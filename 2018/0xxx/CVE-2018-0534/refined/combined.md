# JVN#30864198 ArsenoL vulnerable to cross-site scripting

## Overview

ArsenoL contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

## Vendor Information

Developer: FlaFla...

Product name and version:ArsenoL Version 0.5

## Description

ArsenoL provided by FlaFla... is software that can be downloaded from the Internet. ArsenoL is a dictionay software that is placed on a website used to post words and their meanings. ArsenoL contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability ([CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)) where an arbitrary script may be executed when the victim accesses a malicious page created by an attacker.

## Impact

Due to this vulnerability, a victim being tricked into accessing a malicious link may have the webpage display altered or Cookie information in the victim's web browser may be leaked.

## Solution

**Consider stop using ArsenoL Version 0.5**

Since the developer was unreachable, existence of any mitigations are unknown.

## Vendor Opinion

None Provided

## JPCERT/CC Addendum

During the meeting of Committee for authorizing the disclosure of unresolved vulnerabilities held on November 24, 2015, it was judged that an advisory for this vulnerability  shall be disclosed since all the criteria and conditions described below which are stated in [Standards for Handling Software Vulnerability Information and Others (Directive #110, 2014)](http://www.meti.go.jp/policy/netsecurity/downloadfiles/140514kaiseikokuji.pdf) and [Information Security Early Warning Partnership Guideline](//www.ipa.go.jp/files/000044732.pdf) have been satisfied.

1. The developer of the product is unreachable

   JPCERT/CC had tried to reach the developer for a period of time (more than 9 months) however there were no responses from the developer.  Therefore the committee reached the conclusion that it is reasonable and appropriate to judge the developer is unreachable.

   - No response to disclosure of the developer’s name (listed on September 29, 2011) in “[List of unreachable developers](http://jvn.jp/en/reply/index.html)” page on JVN.

   - No response to disclosure of product name and its version (listed on December 16, 2011) in “[List of unreachable developers](http://jvn.jp/en/reply/index.html)” page on JVN.

3. Existence of vulnerability has been verified

   It was verified that the product contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability by IPA.  Arbitrary script execution on the user’s web browser was confirmed which violates the “Integrity” of the product.  For verification details, refer to the “Verification” section.
4. Not disclosing this case may result in the risk that product users will have no means to know of the existence of the vulnerability in the product

   Users are permitted to copy, revise, or distribute the product and it is downloadable via internet. Therefore, the developer cannot directly contact all users of this product to notify of the cross-site scripting vulnerability.  It was determined that disclosure of this vulnerability is legitimate under these conditions.
5. There are no particular reasons that would make disclosure inappropriate

   After considering the developer’s stance and the risk to product users, the committee has judged that there are no particular reasons that would make disclosure inappropriate or that disclosure may cause any other issues.
