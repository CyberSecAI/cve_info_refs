"text": "A vulnerability in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) packet reassembly functionality of the detection engine in Cisco Firepower System Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the detection engine to consume excessive system memory on an affected device, which could cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to the affected software improperly handling changes to SSL connection states. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted SSL connections through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the detection engine to consume excessive system memory on the affected device, which could cause a DoS condition. The device may need to be reloaded manually to recover from this condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180418-fpsnort [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180418-fpsnort\"]"

Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco Firepower System Software Releases 6.0.0 and later, if the software is configured as described in this section and the software is running on any of the following Cisco products:    + Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) 5500-X Series Firewalls with FirePOWER Services   + Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls   + Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) for Networks, 7000 Series Appliances   + Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) for Networks, 8000 Series Appliances   + Firepower 4100 Series Appliances   + FirePOWER 7000 Series Appliances   + FirePOWER 8000 Series Appliances   + Firepower 9300 Series Security Appliances   + Firepower Threat Defense for Integrated Services Routers (ISRs)   + Firepower Threat Defense Virtual for VMware   + Industrial Security Appliance 3000   + Sourcefire 3D System Appliances A device is vulnerable if the software is configured to pass encrypted traffic that matches an SSL policy rule or has a default rule action of **Do not decrypt**. Determining the Cisco Firepower System Software Release To determine which Cisco Firepower System Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device and use the **show version** command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Release 6.2.0:  ```   > show version   ``` Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software   + Firepower Management Center   + Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) Software   + Meraki MX Security Appliances   + Next-Generation Intrusion Prevention System (NGIPSv) for VMware   + Snort IPS for Integrated Services Routers (ISRs)  Details  * This vulnerability could cause the Snort process to exhaust system memory on an affected device and restart. While the Snort process is restarting, threat detection could be bypassed, inspection of all network traffic could fail, or network traffic could be prevented from passing through the device, depending on the platform and device configuration.  On Cisco FirePOWER platforms:    + Passive and bypass interfaces will bypass inspection and traffic will pass through the device.   + Routed, switched, and nonbypass interfaces will drop the traffic; traffic will not pass through the device.   + Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software will drop the traffic; traffic will not pass through the device. On Cisco ASA 5500-X Series Firewalls with FirePOWER Services, traffic will bypass threat detection and will not be dropped, if the **sfr fail-open** CLI command is supported and configured on the ASA.  Indicators of Compromise  * Exploitation of this vulnerability could cause the following error message to appear in the /var/log/messages system log file for an affected device:  ```   Firepower-module2 kernel: [109568.659049] snort invoked oom-killer: gfp_mask=0xd0, order=0, oom_score_adj=0   ```  Contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) if additional assistance is required to determine whether the device has been compromised by this vulnerability.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.  **Customers Without Service Contracts**  Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 8.6 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.6 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 8.6 |
