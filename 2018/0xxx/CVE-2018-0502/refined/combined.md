Package: zsh
Version: 5.5.1-1
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Control: found -1 5.3.1-4
Control: fixed -1 5.6-1

Hi,

these two issues have been already fixed with the 5.6-1 upload which
happened just minutes after the embargo for these issues was over.

Because of the embargo there wasn't a proper bug report yet. So this bug
report is primarily to track the fix of these issues in Debian Buster,
Stretch and maybe also in Debian (E)LTS releases.

From the upstream 5.6 release notes:
> [CVE-2018-0502](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-0502): Data from the second line of a #! script file might be
> passed to execve().  For example, in the following situation -
>
>     printf '#!foo\nbar' > baz
>     ./baz
>
> the shell might take "bar" rather than "foo" for the argv[0] to be
> passed to execve().  [ Reported by Anthony Sottile and Buck Evan. ]
>
> [CVE-2018-13259](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-13259): A shebang line longer than 64 characters would be
> truncated.  For example, in the following situation:
>
>     ( printf '#!'; repeat 64 printf 'x'; printf 'y' ) > foo
>     ./foo
>
> the shell might execute x...x (64 repetitions) rather than x...xy (64
> x's, one y).  [ Reported by Daniel Shahaf. ]

(JFTR: The Debian Security Team doesn't consider a DSA necessary for
these issues and recommends to fix the issues in Stretch via the next
Debian Minor Stable Update.)

# Zsh: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **201903-02**

Input validation errors in Zsh could result in arbitrary code
execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-shells/zsh** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.6** |

### Background

A shell designed for interactive use, although it is also a powerful
scripting language.

### Description

Two input validation errors have been discovered in how Zsh parses
scripts:

* Parsing a malformed shebang line could cause Zsh to call a program
  listed in the second line (CVE-2018-0502)
* Shebang lines longer than 64 characters are truncated
  (CVE-2018-13259)

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to execute a specially crafted script
using Zsh, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Zsh users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-shells/zsh-5.6"

```
### References

* [CVE-2018-0502](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-0502)
* [CVE-2018-13259](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-13259)

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

                 CVE-2018-1100 CVE-2018-13259 CVE-2019-20044
Debian Bug     : 908000 894044 894043 895225 951458

Several security vulnerabilities were found and corrected in zsh, a powerful
shell and scripting language. Off-by-one errors, wrong parsing of shebang lines
and buffer overflows may lead to unexpected behavior. A local, unprivileged
user can create a specially crafted message file or directory path. If the
receiving user is privileged or traverses the aforementioned path, this leads
to privilege escalation.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
5.3.1-4+deb9u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your zsh packages.

For the detailed security status of zsh please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/zsh>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [zsh](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/zsh)
  -
  [5.4.2-3ubuntu3.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/zsh/5.4.2-3ubuntu3.1)

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [zsh](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/zsh)
