{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `nt!NtQueryVirtualMemory` system call, when invoked with `MemoryBasicInformation` (0x0) or `MemoryPrivilegedBasicInformation` (0x8) information classes, discloses uninitialized kernel stack memory to user-mode clients due to padding and unused bytes in the `MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION` structure not being initialized.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory disclosure",
      "Uninitialized stack memory"
    ],
    "impact": "Local authenticated attackers can potentially defeat exploit mitigations like kernel ASLR or read other secrets stored in the kernel address space by repeatedly triggering the vulnerability.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by making a call to the `NtQueryVirtualMemory` syscall with the `MemoryBasicInformation` or `MemoryPrivilegedBasicInformation` information classes from user mode.",
      "required_capabilities": "Local user access with the ability to call the `NtQueryVirtualMemory` syscall."
