Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2018-0231:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the Transport Layer Security (TLS) library of Cisco ASA Software and Cisco FTD Software.
- It is caused by insufficient validation of user-supplied input. Specifically, the lack of proper checks on a malicious TLS message sent to an interface with Secure Layer Socket (SSL) services enabled can trigger a buffer underflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The software fails to adequately validate the TLS message received, allowing for the injection of malicious input.
- **Buffer Underflow:** This occurs when the software attempts to write data before the start of the allocated buffer. This is caused by the missing input sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can cause the affected device to crash and reload, leading to a DoS condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
- **Network:** The attacker sends a malicious TLS message over the network.
- The vulnerability can be triggered via multiple interfaces like ASDM, AnyConnect SSL VPN, Clientless SSL VPN, MUS, or SAML SSO.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to the device.
- **Low Skill Level:** The advisory states that this vulnerability is of low skill to exploit.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a malicious TLS message to an interface enabled for SSL services.
- SSLv2 and SSLv3 are not vulnerable.
- The affected software includes Cisco ASA Software version 9.2 or later and specific versions of Cisco FTD Software.
- There are no known workarounds; a software update is required for mitigation.
