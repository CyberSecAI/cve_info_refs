Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-0114:

**Vulnerability:**

-   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from `node-jose`'s handling of JSON Web Signature (JWS) standards for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). The standard allows for a JSON Web Key (JWK) containing a public key to be embedded within the JWS header.  `node-jose` versions before 0.11.0 trust this embedded public key for verification of the signature.

-   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core weakness is the unconditional trust of an embedded public key in the JWS header. This allows an attacker to replace a legitimate signature with one generated using their own private key that corresponds to a malicious public key they embedded in the token's header.

-   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can forge valid JWS/JWT objects, potentially bypassing authentication or authorization mechanisms relying on signature verification. This allows the attacker to manipulate the token contents with their own key and create a valid token.

-   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves crafting a JWS/JWT object that:
    1. Removes the original signature.
    2.  Adds a malicious JWK containing a public key controlled by the attacker.
    3. Signs the modified object with the attacker's corresponding private key.

-   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    -   The attacker does not need prior authentication, making this a remote, unauthenticated vulnerability.
    -   The attacker needs the ability to generate their own RSA key pair.
    - The attacker must be able to inject or manipulate JWT tokens, which are used by a vulnerable system using the affected version of `node-jose`.

**Additional Information from the provided content:**

-   The provided GitHub repository `zi0Black/POC-CVE-2018-0114` contains a Python script `jwk-node-jose.py` which demonstrates the exploit.
-   The exploit code works by generating an RSA key pair, embedding the public key in a forged JWT header, then signing the JWT with the private key.
-   The exploit is achieved by creating a forged JWT token with the malicious key embedded in the header.
-   The provided code was tested with both python2.7 and python3.
-   The vulnerability was fixed in `node-jose` version 0.11.0.

In summary, the CVE-2018-0114 vulnerability in node-jose allows an attacker to forge valid JWT tokens by embedding a malicious key into the header and re-signing the token with the corresponding private key because the library is designed to trust the keys embedded in the token.
