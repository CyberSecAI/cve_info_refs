Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-0182:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Multiple command injection vulnerabilities exist in the CLI parser of Cisco IOS XE Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection (CWE-78): The software fails to properly sanitize or validate input to the CLI, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Gaining access to the underlying Linux shell:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to break out of the restricted CLI environment and access the underlying operating system (Linux shell).
- **Executing commands with root privileges:** Once in the Linux shell, the attacker can execute commands with the highest level of privileges (root), potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The CVSS score reflects a low impact on all three, indicating that while the vulnerability can be exploited to gain root privileges, it's limited to the device itself.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access (AV:L):** The attacker must have local access to the affected Cisco device.
- **Low Attack Complexity (AC:L):** Exploiting the vulnerability is relatively straightforward and does not require special conditions.
- **Low Privileges Required (PR:L):** The attacker needs to have valid credentials and low level access to use the CLI.
- **No User Interaction Required (UI:N):** Exploitation does not require any user interaction beyond having access to the device CLI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have valid user credentials to log into the Cisco IOS XE software CLI.
- Physical or logical access to the device (e.g. through console or network connection) is necessary.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is part of a group of vulnerabilities disclosed in the Cisco Security Advisory cisco-sa-20180328-cmdinj.
- There are no workarounds available.
- Fixed software is available, detailed information can be found in the linked Cisco bug IDs.
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
