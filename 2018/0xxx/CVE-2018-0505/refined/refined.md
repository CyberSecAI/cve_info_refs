Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0505:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that MediaWiki's BotPassword authentication mechanism did not respect CentralAuth's account lock status. This allowed a user with a bot password to bypass the account lock and perform actions on the wiki, even though their primary account was locked.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** Bot passwords were not checked against the account lock status enforced by CentralAuth.
*   **Inconsistent Authentication:** The authentication flow for bot passwords was not properly integrated with the user account status checks.
*   **Missing Hooks:**  The CentralAuth extension did not implement hooks or checks that would have prevented bot passwords from being used on locked accounts. Specifically, `CentralAuth` did not use hooks for "ChangeUserGroups" and did not properly utilize `$title->userCan` for authorization checks. Instead, it was using `$wgUser->isAllowed()`, which was not correctly considering account locks.
*   **Session Management Issues:** Locking an account did not invalidate existing bot password sessions, nor did it rotate the `bp_token`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Bypassing Account Locks:** Attackers could bypass account locks enforced by CentralAuth, potentially allowing them to perform unauthorized actions even when an account was intended to be disabled.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  A user with a bot password associated with a locked account could gain the ability to perform privileged actions within the wiki. As initially reported, user rights could be changed.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **Account Compromise:** An attacker could compromise a user account with the "change user rights" privilege.
2.  **Bot Password Creation:** The attacker could create a bot password associated with the compromised account.
3.  **Account Lock:**  The compromised account could be locked via CentralAuth due to suspicious activity or policy enforcement.
4.  **API Access via Bot Password:**  The attacker could use the bot password to log in and perform unauthorized actions via the MediaWiki API.
5.  **User Rights Modification:**  The attacker could modify the user rights of other accounts due to the bypass.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Compromised Account:** An attacker needs to compromise an account that has the privilege to create bot passwords and has "change user rights" privileges.
*   **Bot Password:** The attacker must have access to a valid bot password for the compromised account.
*   **API Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the MediaWiki API.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by adding a check to prevent bot password logins if the associated account was locked.
*   The fix involved a code change of 8 lines of code, and was applied across different MediaWiki versions (1.27, 1.29, 1.30, and 1.31).
*   The issue highlighted a broader problem with the inconsistent definition and implementation of account locking within MediaWiki.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Low" severity by Red Hat.
*   The fix was deployed to Wikimedia sites, and later included in security releases.
