Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-0821:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the "Constrained Impersonation Capability" introduced in Windows 10. This feature allows a LowBox process (a process running with limited privileges) to impersonate another LowBox token under specific conditions. The flaw lies in the fact that a normal user can create a new AppContainer (AC) process with arbitrary capabilities and an arbitrary package SID, bypassing the intended security restrictions of the constrained impersonation mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Bypass of Constrained Impersonation Checks:** The vulnerability bypasses the checks intended to limit impersonation capabilities to low-privilege processes with the same package SID and a subset of capabilities.
*   **Arbitrary Token Creation:** A normal user can create a lowbox token with any capabilities and an arbitrary package SID.
*   **Impersonation of System Tokens:** By exploiting a UAC elevation (or similar) a lowbox process can get a SYSTEM token, and use it to impersonate a SYSTEM token.
*   **Abuse of SYSTEM privileges through impersonated lowbox token:** SYSTEM privilege is implicitly trusted and has access to resources, and can do things a normal user cannot, such as interacting with services that require elevated permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** By impersonating a SYSTEM token within a LowBox process, an attacker can elevate privileges from a normal user account and then potentially interact with system services.
*   **Access to System Resources:** Once a SYSTEM token is impersonated, the attacker gains access to resources normally restricted to the SYSTEM account, such as specific service handles.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** The ability to interact with system services can be leveraged further for actions like starting or stopping services, or potentially exploiting other vulnerabilities with the new privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Token Capture:** The attacker must first obtain a token with the same session ID as the current process. The proof-of-concept (PoC) uses a WebDAV server on localhost and UAC elevation prompts to capture a SYSTEM token, but other methods are also possible.
2.  **Lowbox process creation:** Using the captured token, the attacker then creates a new LowBox process with the capability, which isn't blocked for normal users.
3.  **Impersonation:** The newly created lowbox process then impersonates the captured SYSTEM token.
4.  **Resource Exploitation:** The attacker then utilizes the impersonated SYSTEM token to interact with services, exploiting weaknesses in those services.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Normal User Access:** The attacker needs to have a normal user account on the vulnerable system.
*   **Ability to Create Processes:** The attacker needs the ability to create new processes and lowbox tokens.
*   **Local Access:** This is a local privilege escalation vulnerability, so the attacker must have access to the system.
*   **WebDAV Server (for PoC):** The provided PoC utilizes a WebDAV server to trigger the token capture, but this could potentially be substituted with other methods of obtaining a suitable token with the same session ID.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit code uses a vulnerability in SERVICE\_STATUS to access the WebClient service, but this is just one example of how this impersonation can be used to do things the user would not normally be able to do. Other services could potentially be exploited.
*   The PoC demonstrates that the issue is not specific to UAC, as it still works with an OTS UAC elevation.
*   The vulnerability is described as an EoP from a normal user, with an attack that leverages the ability to impersonate a SYSTEM token, allowing access to resources not normally accessible to the user.
