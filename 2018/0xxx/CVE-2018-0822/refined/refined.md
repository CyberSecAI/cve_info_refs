{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way Windows 10 handles Global Reparse Points, a new feature introduced in version 1709. The kernel fails to properly check for sandbox mitigations when creating these reparse points and the NTFS driver does not check for the SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege, resulting in an ability to create symbolic links to any file type without required privileges.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient checks for sandbox mitigations when creating Global Reparse Points.",
      "NTFS driver does not enforce SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege for Global Reparse Points.",
      "Failure to properly validate reparse buffer structure leading to potential for passing untrusted data to the object manager."
     ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass sandbox limitations and elevate privileges by creating arbitrary file symbolic links.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local access. An attacker can create the malicious symbolic link on the file system.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user or in a sandbox environment. They do not need developer mode to be enabled."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The provided text includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) and C# code to exploit the vulnerability. It indicates that this issue was present in Windows 10 1709 and not in prior versions."
