{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerabilities exist because the affected software does not sufficiently sanitize command arguments before passing commands to the Linux shell for execution.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input sanitization",
      "Command Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to break from the CLI of the affected software, gain access to the underlying Linux shell on an affected device, and execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Malicious CLI commands"
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "An authenticated, local attacker is required. The attacker needs to be able to submit a crafted command to the CLI."
