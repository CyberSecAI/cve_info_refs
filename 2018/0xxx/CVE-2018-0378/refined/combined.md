The vulnerability is due to a lack of protection against PTP frame flood attacks. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending large streams of malicious IPv4 or IPv6 PTP traffic to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition, impacting the traffic passing through the device.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco Nexus 5500, 5600, and 6000 Series Switches that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco NX-OS Software.  For information about which Cisco NX-OS Software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fixed) section of this advisory. Determining the NX-OS Software Release Administrators can check the version of NX-OS Software running on their device by using the **show version** command from the device CLI. The following example identifies the **7.3(2)N1(1)** release:    ```   nx-os# show versionCisco Nexus Operating System (NX-OS) SoftwareTAC support: http://www.cisco.com/tacDocuments: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps9372/tsd_products_support_series_home.htmlCopyright (c) 2002-2017, Cisco Systems, Inc.

Software  BIOS:      version 1.1.7  Power Sequencer Firmware:             Module 0: SF-Microcontroller v.0.7, SF-FPGA v.0.6             …  FPGA Firmware:             Module 0: FPGA v.0.0.0.18…  kickstart: version 7.3(2)N1(1)  system:    version 7.3(2)N1(1)   ``` Determining Whether PTP is Enabled on a Device Administrators can check to see if the PTP feature is running on an affected device by issuing the following command.  The **show ptp brief** command displays the PTP state of all interfaces. A PTP port can be in one of the following three states or disabled:    + **Master**: The port is the source of time on the path served by the port.   + **Slave**: The port synchronizes with the device on the path on the port that is in the master state.   + **Disabled**: PTP is not enabled on this port.   + **Passive**: The port is not the master on the path, nor does it synchronize with a master. **Note:** By default, PTP is disabled on the device.  The following is an example of the **show ptp brief** output with PTP enabled:  ```   switch# sh ptp brief    ```  ```    PTP port status-----------------------Port         State -------  --------------Eth1/3      Enabled   ```   Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Firepower 2100 Series   + Firepower 4100 Series Next-Generation Firewall   + Firepower 9300 Security Appliances   + MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches   + Nexus 1000V Switch for Microsoft Hyper-V   + Nexus 1000V Switch for VMware vSphere   + Nexus 2000 Series Switches   + Nexus 3000 Series Switches   + Nexus 3500 Platform Switches   + Nexus 3600 Platform Switches   + Nexus 4000 Series Switches   + Nexus 7000 Series Switches   + Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application-Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode   + Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode   + Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules   + UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects  Details  * PTP is a time synchronization protocol for nodes distributed across a network. Its hardware timestamp feature provides greater accuracy than other time synchronization protocols such as the Network Time Protocol (NTP). For more information on how and where to configure PTP on a device, see [Cisco Nexus 5000 Series NX-OS System Management Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus5000/sw/system_management/502_n1_1/b_Cisco_n5k_system_mgmt_cg_rel_502_n1_1/Cisco_n5k_system_mgmt_cg_rel_502_n1_1_preface1.html), or contact Cisco TAC for further technical information.  Workarounds  * Customers who are not using the PTP feature can disable it with the **no feature ptp** command as shown in the following example:  To enter global configuration mode:  ```   switch# configure terminal   ```  **Note:** Enabling PTP on the switch does not enable PTP on each interface.  To enable or disable PTP on the device:  ```   switch(config) # no feature ptp   ```  See [Cisco Nexus 5000 Series NX-OS System Management Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus5000/sw/system_management/502_n1_1/b_Cisco_n5k_system_mgmt_cg_rel_502_n1_1/Cisco_n5k_system_mgmt_cg_rel_502_n1_1_preface1.html) for technical assistance regarding PTP.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 8.6 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.6 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 8.6 |
