  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in how Internet Explorer handles the RegExp.lastMatch property when the RegExp.input is set to an object with a custom toString() method. Specifically, when the toString() method is called within the context of a string match operation, it can trigger a memory disclosure issue.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Memory disclosure vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability can lead to the disclosure of potentially sensitive information from the browser's memory. In some cases it results in a crash.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting malicious JavaScript code and loading it into Internet Explorer.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to execute arbitrary Javascript code in the context of Internet Explorer"
