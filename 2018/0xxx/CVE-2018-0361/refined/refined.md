Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2018-0361:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the PDF parser of ClamAV. Specifically, it's related to the PDF object length check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The vulnerability is due to the PDF parser taking an "unreasonably long time to parse a relatively small file" due to how it handles object length checks. This suggests inefficient or flawed logic in the parsing process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The primary impact is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This occurs because the inefficient parsing of specially crafted PDF files can cause ClamAV to consume excessive resources or get stuck in a long parsing process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a specially crafted PDF file. This file would contain data that triggers the inefficient length check in ClamAV's PDF parser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs the ability to submit a malicious PDF file to be scanned by ClamAV. This could be through email, web uploads, or other means where ClamAV is used to scan incoming data.

**Summary of CVE-2018-0361:**

CVE-2018-0361 describes a vulnerability in ClamAV's PDF parser where a specially crafted PDF file with a specific structure will cause the parser to take an unreasonably long time to parse a relatively small file. This leads to a denial-of-service condition as the system resources are exhausted during the parsing process.
