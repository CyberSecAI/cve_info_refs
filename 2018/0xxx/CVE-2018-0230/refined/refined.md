Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-0230

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the internal packet-processing functionality of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software. Specifically, the software improperly validates IPv4 and IPv6 packets after reassembling them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Improper input validation of reassembled IP packets (IPv4 and IPv6).
*   Lack of proper handling of malicious fragmented packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
*   The Snort processes on the affected device will hang at 100% CPU utilization.
*   The device stops processing traffic until it is manually reloaded.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Remote, unauthenticated attackers.
*   Attackers send a series of malicious fragmented IPv4 or IPv6 packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected Cisco Firepower 2100 Series Security Appliance.
*   No authentication is required.

**Affected Products:**
*   Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software Releases 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 when running on Cisco Firepower 2100 Series Security Appliances.

**Unaffected Products**
* Cisco FTD Software running on Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances and Cisco Integrated Services Routers.
* Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software running on Cisco Firepower 2100 Series Security Appliances.

**Additional Notes:**
*   There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address this issue.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
*   CVSS v3 Base Score: 8.6 (High)
*   CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H
