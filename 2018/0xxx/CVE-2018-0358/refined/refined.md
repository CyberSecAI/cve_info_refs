Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the exhaustion of file descriptors due to the processing of a high volume of traffic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Insufficient file descriptor handling within the Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) Expressway software. This leads to a resource exhaustion vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- Specifically, an attacker can trigger a restart of a specific process on the affected system.
- This restart causes a temporary interruption of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attack vector via the network.
- Exploitation is achieved by an attacker establishing a high number of concurrent TCP connections to the vulnerable system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker can be unauthenticated and remote.
- The attacker needs to be able to create many TCP connections to the target server.

**Additional Details:**
- There are no known workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is assigned a CVSS base score of 5.3, with a vector string of `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L`.
