  "CVE-2018-0598": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "Self-extracting archive files created by IExpress may insecurely load Dynamic Link Libraries.",
    "details": [
      {
        "type": "Root cause",
        "detail": "The vulnerability is caused by an issue in the DLL search path used by self-extracting archives created with IExpress. This can lead to insecure loading of DLLs due to 'Application Directory (App Dir) DLL planting'."
      },
      {
        "type": "Vulnerability",
        "detail": "The vulnerability is a DLL planting issue, specifically in the application directory. When an application attempts to load a DLL without a fully qualified path, Windows searches a defined set of directories. An attacker can exploit this by placing a malicious DLL in the same directory as a self-extracting archive which loads the DLL."
      },
       {
        "type": "Impact",
        "detail": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user who runs the vulnerable self-extracting archive file. This can lead to complete compromise of the user's system."
      },
      {
        "type": "Attack vector",
         "detail": "The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in the same directory as a vulnerable self-extracting archive. When the user executes the archive, it will load the attacker's DLL instead of the intended one."
      },
      {
        "type": "Required attacker capabilities",
        "detail": "An attacker needs to trick a user into placing the malicious DLL in the same directory as the self-extracting archive file. This requires social engineering. The attacker does not need any specific privileges to exploit this vulnerability, but user interaction is required."
      }
    ],
    "remediation": "Microsoft considers this a Defense-in-Depth issue and will not address this with a security update. The provided workarounds are:\n\n* Save self-extracting archive files into a newly created directory, and confirm there are no unrelated files in the directory then invoke the files.\n* Make sure there are no suspicious files in the directory where self-extracting archive files are saved."
