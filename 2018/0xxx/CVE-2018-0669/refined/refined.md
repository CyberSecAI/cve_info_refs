Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of **CVE-2018-0669**:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The INplc-RT product has a vulnerability related to incomplete authentication. This allows attackers to send spoofed requests, bypassing authentication mechanisms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass (CWE-287):** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authentication in the INplc-RT software.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Control:** Attackers can gain unauthorized control of the control equipment.
- **Ladder Program Tampering:** Attackers can tamper with ladder programs, which are used to define the logic of the control system.
- **Malicious File Placement:** Attackers can place malicious files on the system.
- **Foot-hold for Illegal Invasion:** Exploitation can result in a foothold for further malicious activities.
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary commands through the traffic based on the protocol.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based Attacks:**  The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- **Spoofed Requests:** Attackers can send crafted, spoofed network requests to the INplc-RT software.
- **Protocol-conforming Traffic:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability using traffic that conforms to the protocol used by INplc-RT.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the system running INplc-RT.
- **Understanding of INplc-RT Protocol:** The attacker needs to be familiar with the INplc-RT protocol to craft the necessary requests.
- **No Prior Authentication Required:** The vulnerability allows the attacker to bypass authentication, suggesting no prior authentication is needed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in INplc-RT version 3.08 and earlier.
- It is also noted that this vulnerability is related to CVE-2018-0670, both being categorized as Authentication Bypass issues.
- Mitigation includes updating the software and restricting access to specific ports.
- The reported CVSS v3 score is 9.8, indicating a critical vulnerability.
