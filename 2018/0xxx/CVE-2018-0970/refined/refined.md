    "root_cause": "The `nt!NtQueryVolumeInformationFile` system call, when invoked against certain kernel objects, discloses uninitialized kernel stack memory to user-mode clients.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Disclosure of uninitialized kernel stack memory",
       "Type mismatch in `IO_STATUS_BLOCK` union on x64 platforms resulting in partial uninitialized data leak."

    "platforms_affected": "Windows 10 (32/64-bit); other versions were not tested. The provided proof of concept specifically tests on Windows 10 (1709) 64-bit.",
    "leaks_description": "Two types of leaks can occur:\n  - A 64-bit specific leak of 4 bytes of uninitialized kernel stack memory due to a mismatch between the sizes of `NTSTATUS` (4 bytes) and `PVOID` (8 bytes) within the `IO_STATUS_BLOCK` union, when the `Status` field is initialized but the `Pointer` field is not.\n  - A complete leak of uninitialized `IO_STATUS_BLOCK` structure, resulting in an 8 byte leak on x86 and a 16 byte leak on x64 systems."
