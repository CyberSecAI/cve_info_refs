The provided content is related to CVE-2018-0304.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of Cisco Fabric Services packet headers by the affected software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Insufficient input validation of Cisco Fabric Services packet headers.
- Potential buffer overflow or buffer overread condition in the Cisco Fabric Services component.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can read sensitive memory content.
- An attacker can create a denial of service (DoS) condition.
- An attacker can execute arbitrary code as *root*.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector varies depending on the Cisco Fabric Services distribution type configured:
    - **CFSoFC (Cisco Fabric Services over Fibre Channel):** Attack via FCoE (Fibre Channel over Ethernet) or FCIP (Fibre Channel over IP) on configured FC ports (data plane). If no FC ports are configured, this vector is not applicable.
    - **CFSoE (Cisco Fabric Services over Ethernet):** Attack possible only from a vPC (virtual Port Channel) peer or an attacker with access to a vPC peer link.
    - **CFSoIP (Cisco Fabric Services over IP):** Attack possible from any node with IP network connectivity to the device's management interface. (management plane)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **CFSoFC:** An attacker must be able to send crafted Cisco Fabric Services packets on a configured FC port.
- **CFSoE:** An attacker needs to be either a vPC peer or have access to a vPC peer link.
- **CFSoIP:** An attacker needs IP network connectivity to the device's management interface.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft specific Cisco Fabric Services packets.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
