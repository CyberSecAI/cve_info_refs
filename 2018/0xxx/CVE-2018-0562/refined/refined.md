Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0562:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The installer for SoundEngine Free software contains a vulnerability related to the DLL search path. It insecurely loads Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) due to a weakness in how it searches for and loads these libraries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-427:**  Uncontrolled Search Path Element. The installer does not properly control the locations it searches for DLL files, making it susceptible to DLL hijacking/planting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the installer. An attacker can place a malicious DLL in a location searched by the installer, and it will be loaded and executed when the installer runs.
- This could lead to complete control of the system, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** An attacker needs to have local access to the user's system.
- **User Interaction:** The user must run the vulnerable installer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL file in a location where the installer searches for DLLs. This usually involves knowing the specific directory or directories the installer will look at.
- The attacker must trick the user into running the installer.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability specifically affects the installer program, not the installed application itself. Users who have already installed SoundEngine Free are not affected.
- A fix has been released in version 5.22 and later. Users are advised to use the latest installer.
- The attack involves a user being tricked into placing a malicious DLL in a specific folder.
- The CVSS v3 score is 7.8 (High) and the CVSS v2 score is 6.8 (Medium).
