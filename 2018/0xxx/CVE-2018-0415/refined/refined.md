Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper processing of certain Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN (EAPOL) frames within the implementation of EAPOL functionality in Cisco Small Business 100 and 300 Series Wireless Access Points.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper handling of EAPOL frames.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the affected device.
- Successful exploitation allows the attacker to force the access point (AP) to disassociate all associated stations (STAs) and prevent future new association requests. This effectively disables the wireless network provided by the affected access point.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), meaning the attacker needs to be within the wireless range of the affected access point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated (PR:L) with the access point. This suggests that the attacker would need to be a user already associated with the network.
- The attacker must be able to send crafted EAPOL frames to the affected device.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
- There are no workarounds to address the vulnerability besides patching.
- The CVSS score is 6.8 (Medium), with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H.
