**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- Improper memory management, specifically a double-free or use-after-free condition when handling login block configurations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

**Attack Vectors:**

- Remote, unauthenticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability via Telnet or SSH.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must have network access to the Cisco IOS device and must send multiple login attempts with invalid credentials.
- The attacker must also trigger the vulnerability by performing these failed login attempts while the administrator modifies the `login block-for` configuration.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in the Login Enhancements (Login Block) feature of Cisco IOS software.
- This feature is not enabled by default.
- This vulnerability is distinct from CVE-2018-0179, and a device can be vulnerable to one but not the other.
- The device will log an error message about a bad chunk reference count in process *Secure Login*  after the vulnerability has been exploited.
- Exploitation of this vulnerability will cause an affected device to generate a crashinfo file
