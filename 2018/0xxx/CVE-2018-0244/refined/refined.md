Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0244:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how the Cisco Firepower System Software's detection engine handles the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol when a large file transfer fails. Specifically, if parts of a file are successfully transferred, but the entire transfer ultimately fails and is reset, the system may not correctly apply configured file action policies.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **File Policy Bypass:** The core vulnerability is the ability to bypass a configured file action policy intended to drop the SMB protocol when malware is detected.
- **Incomplete File Transfer Handling:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specific scenario of a failed, large SMB file transfer, which isn't properly handled by the detection engine.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malware Delivery:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to send a crafted SMB file transfer containing malware. This malware could pass through the targeted device, even if the device is configured to block such files.
- **Compromised Security:** The bypass of file action policies could lead to compromised security of systems protected by the vulnerable Cisco Firepower device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attack vector is remote, meaning the attacker doesn't need local access to the targeted device or any user credentials.
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending specially crafted SMB requests over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send SMB requests to the targeted Cisco Firepower device.
- **SMB Request Crafting:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a specific type of SMB file transfer request that triggers the vulnerability. This involves initiating a large file transfer that will intentionally fail.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects Cisco Firepower System Software when file action policies are configured. All software releases before version 6.2.3 are affected.
- **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds that can mitigate the vulnerability.
- **Fixed Software:** The vulnerability is fixed in software release 6.2.3.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a base CVSS v3 score of 5.8 (Medium). The vector string is CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N, indicating a network-based attack, with low complexity, no required privileges, no user interaction, a changed scope, no confidentiality impact, a low integrity impact, and no availability impact.
