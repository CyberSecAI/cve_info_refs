{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The nt!NtWaitForDebugEvent system call discloses portions of uninitialized kernel stack memory to user-mode clients.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Disclosure: The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly initialize a 4-byte field within a stack-based buffer used by the `NtWaitForDebugEvent` system call before copying it to user mode.",
      "Uninitialized Memory:  The 4 bytes at offset 0x4 within the 184-byte buffer remain uninitialized, leading to potential information leakage.",
      "Compiler Alignment: The issue is attributed to compiler-introduced alignment between the first (4-byte) and second (8-byte) fields of the buffer structure, which causes the second field to be aligned to 8 bytes, leaving the 4 bytes uninitialized."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability allows a local authenticated attacker to potentially defeat exploit mitigations (like kernel ASLR) or read other secrets stored in the kernel address space.",
    "attack_vectors": {
      "user_mode_to_kernel": "The vulnerability is triggered through the vulnerable `NtWaitForDebugEvent` system call, which allows a user-mode caller to retrieve uninitialized kernel stack memory.",
      "stack_spraying": "The provided exploit uses a technique called 'stack spraying' to populate the stack with a predictable value ('A'), making the information disclosure more visible during debugging."
    },
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Local Access: The attacker needs to have local access to the machine.",
      "Authenticated User: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user to call the vulnerable system call."
