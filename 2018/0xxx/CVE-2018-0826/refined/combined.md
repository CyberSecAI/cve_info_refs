**Vulnerable App:**

```
Windows: StorSvc SvcMoveFileInheritSecurity Arbitrary File Creation EoP
Platform: Windows 10 1709 (not tested earlier versions)
Class: Elevation of Privilege

Summary: The SvcMoveFileInheritSecurity RPC method in StorSvc can be used to move an arbitrary file to an arbitrary location resulting in elevation of privilege.

Description:

I was reading Clément Rouault & Thomas Imbert excellent PacSec’s slides on ALPC+RPC issues and they highlighted the SvcMoveFileInheritSecurity method used to exploit the ALPC bug CVE-2017-11783. The function impersonates the user and calls MoveFileEx to move the file to a new destination, then reverts the impersonation and tries to reset the security descriptor of the new file so that it matches the inheritable permissions. The ALPC bug in CVE-2017-11783 has apparently been fixed but the behavior of the SvcMoveFileInheritSecurity has not been modified as far as I can tell.

The main problem occurs if the call to SetNamedSecurityInfo fails, in that case the code tries to move the file back to its original location, however it does reassert the impersonation. This probably makes sense because it’s possible to have a file/directory which you can open for DELETE but without the rights to create a new file in the same directory. In the case the original move would succeed but the revert would fail. However there’s a TOCTOU issue in that the original path might have been replaced with a mount point which redirects the revert to a totally arbitrary location while running at SYSTEM. The exploit controls both the name and the contents of the file so this would be a trivial privilege escalation.

It’s possible to cause SetNamedSecurityInfo to fail just by adding a Deny ACE to the file for SYSTEM. This will cause the function to get ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED and the revert will take place. By placing an oplock on the original file open we can switch in a mount point and always win the race condition.

Ideally all operations should take place under user impersonation, but if that was the case there’d be no point in doing it in a SYSTEM service to begin with. Note that there’s a second issue specifically with SetNamedSecurityInfo which I’ve sent as a separate issue, just in case it gets missed.

Proof of Concept:

I’ve provided a PoC as a C++ project. It will abuse the SvcMoveFileInheritSecurity method to create the file test.txt in the windows folder.

1) Compile the C++ project.
2) Execute the PoC as a normal user.

Expected Result:
The file reversion fails trying to copy the file back to its original location.

Observed Result:
The file is reverted which results in the test.txt file being creating in c:\windows.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
