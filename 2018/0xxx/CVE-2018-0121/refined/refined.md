Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0121:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper security restrictions within the web-based service portal of the Cisco Elastic Services Controller (ESC) software. Specifically, the portal allows authentication bypass by submitting an empty password when prompted for administrative credentials.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The core vulnerability is the ability to bypass authentication. This is achieved by submitting an empty password, indicating a failure to properly validate or enforce password requirements.
- **Improper Security Restrictions:** The underlying issue is that the system does not properly restrict access, which leads to the vulnerability being exploitable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker administrator privileges for the web-based service portal.
- **Arbitrary Actions:** With administrative access, an attacker can execute arbitrary actions on the affected system.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability Impact**: The CVSS score indicates a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network.
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need prior credentials to attempt the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the web-based service portal over the network.
- **No Special Skills:** The attack is straightforward, involving simply submitting an empty password.

**Summary of relevant information:**
The vulnerability is present in Cisco Elastic Services Controller Software Release 3.0.0. By submitting an empty password an unauthenticated remote attacker can bypass authentication and execute arbitrary actions with administrator privileges on an affected system. The vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Elastic Services Controller Software Releases 3.1.0 and later. There are no workarounds available.
