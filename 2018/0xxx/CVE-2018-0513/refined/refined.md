Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the "MTS Simple Booking C" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin does not sanitize the "company name" and "name" fields when displaying them in the admin panel, making it possible to inject malicious JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS due to the lack of output encoding of user-provided data from the "company name" and "name" fields. This allows an attacker to store malicious scripts in the database. When an admin views the booking list or calendar, these scripts are executed in their browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of a logged-in administrator. This could lead to:
    - **Phishing:** Redirecting the administrator to a fake login page to steal their credentials.
    - **Malware Distribution:**  Redirecting the admin to a page that downloads malware.
    - **Session Hijacking:** Though stated as unlikely, if the cookie stores important data, it could be stolen.
    - **Defacement:**  Modifying the appearance of the admin panel.
    - **Unauthorized actions:** Performing actions on behalf of the logged-in administrator.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the booking form of the plugin.
- An attacker needs to make a booking and include malicious Javascript code in the "company name" or "name" field.
- When an administrator views the booking list or calendar, the stored javascript will execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit a booking through the plugin's booking form.
- They do not need to be authenticated on the WordPress site.
- The attacker does not need to be an administrator, but only an administrator would be affected when viewing the bookings in the admin dashboard.

**Additional Details (Beyond CVE Description):**
- The provided document from the vendor contains much more detail than a typical CVE description:
    -  Specific vulnerable code lines and how to patch them
    -  Affected versions for both free and business versions of the plugin
    -  Explanation of the potential threats and how to recognize an attack
    - Guidance on logging to identify potential attackers
    -  Links to download patches

The vendor also explains the attack is aimed at the administrator and how the injected javascript code will be run within their browser. The provided writeup also explains why a session hijack via cookies is unlikely.
