- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A race condition occurs when both the VLAN and port enter an errdisabled state simultaneously, leading to an incorrect software state.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Race condition in the errdisable per VLAN feature.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a device crash, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors**: An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker can send frames that trigger the errdisable condition.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be adjacent to the vulnerable device and capable of sending specific frames to trigger the errdisable condition. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

The advisory provides detailed information about how to determine if a device is vulnerable based on specific configurations related to errdisable features at the VLAN and port levels. It also provides a comprehensive list of affected product IDs.
