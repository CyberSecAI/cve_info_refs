Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThis vulnerability affects all Cisco IOS XR platforms running 6.3.1, 6.2.3, or earlier releases of Cisco IOS XR Software when at least one IPv4 helper address is configured on an interface of the device.       By default, no IPv4 helper address is enabled in Cisco IOS XR Software.      DHCP Relay Profile helper addresses and DHCPv6 Relay Service configurations are not affected.   **Determining if the Device Has an IPv4 Helper Address Configured**      This vulnerability can be exploited only if the affected device has at least one interface configured with an IPv4 helper address.      The following example shows the output of the **show running-config | include ipv4 helper-address** CLI command on a device with an IPv4 helper address configured: ```   RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:Router# show running-config | include ipv4 helper-addressBuilding configuration...ipv4 helper-address vrf default 192.0.2.1    ```    **Determining the Cisco IOS XR Software Release**      To determine which Cisco IOS XR Software release is running on a device and the name of the device on which it is running, administrators can log in to the device and use the **show version** command in the CLI. If the device is running Cisco IOS XR Software, *Cisco IOS XR Software* or similar text appears in the system banner. The location and name of the system image file that is currently running on the device appears next to the *System image file is* text. The name of the hardware product appears on the line after the name of the system image file.      The following example shows the output of the **show version** command on a device that is running Cisco IOS XR Software release 5.3.4: ```   RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9001#show version   Wed Jan 24 01:32:32.751 EST      Cisco IOS XR Software, Version 5.3.4[Default]   Copyright (c) 2017 by Cisco Systems, Inc.      ROM: System Bootstrap, Version 2.04(20140227:092320) [ASR9K ROMMON],        ASR9001 uptime is 6 hours, 17 minutes   System image file is "bootflash:disk0/asr9k-os-mbi-5.3.4.sp4-1.0.0/0x100000/mbiasr9k-rp.vm"      cisco ASR9K Series (P4040) processor with 8388608K bytes of memory.   P4040 processor at 1500MHz, Revision 2.0   ASR-9001 Chassis      2 Management Ethernet   8 TenGigE   20 GigabitEthernet   8 DWDM controller(s)   8 WANPHY controller(s)   44 GigabitEthernet/IEEE 802.3 interface(s)   219k bytes of non-volatile configuration memory.   2880M bytes of hard disk.   3932144k bytes of disk0: (Sector size 512 bytes).      Configuration register on node 0/RSP0/CPU0 is 0x2102      ``` Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple UDP broadcast packets to an interface that is configured with an IPv4 helper address. This would cause a buffer leak in the Software Packet Path (SPP) on the active Route Processor (RP) of the affected device.      Consumption of all available SPP buffers on the active RP would cause the device to start dropping control plane traffic, including routing protocol packets. While experiencing this problem, traffic that is destined to the device and, depending on the information learned from the routing protocols, pass-through traffic could be dropped, resulting in a DoS condition. A manual reload of the device would be needed to restore operations.      SPP buffers utilization on the active RP can be monitored using the **show spp buffers location** CLI command. The active RP can be identified with the **show redundancy** CLI command.      The following example shows the output of the **show redundancy** CLI command on a device with **0/RSP0/CPU0** in the active RP role: ```   RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:Router#show redundancy      Redundancy information for node 0/RSP0/CPU0:   ==========================================   Node 0/RSP0/CPU0 is in ACTIVE role   .   .   .   ```  The following example shows the output of the **show spp buffer location 0/RSP0/CPU0** CLI command on an affected device:  ```   RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:Router#show spp buffer location 0/RSP0/CPU0      SPP Buffer Analysis      PID Buffers   0 15065   225413 41108      Total Buffers in use: 49138   Owned by clients/spp (of which plugins): 41108/8030 (0)   .   .   .   ```  A continuous increase of the **Owned by clients** buffers could be an indication of a buffer leak. The number of free buffers can be calculated by subtracting the number of **Owned by SPP** buffers from the number of buffers associated with **PID 0**. When the number of free buffers is reduced to 8192 or fewer, the affected device might be starting to drop control plane packets. In the previous example, the number of buffers associated with **PID 0** is **15065** and the number of **Owned by SPP** buffers is **8030**, so the number of free buffers is 15065 - 8030 = 7035.  Indicators of Compromise  * Exploitation of this vulnerability could cause the affected device to consume all available SPP buffers and generate error messages similar to the following: ```   RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:Feb 23 17:25:11.697 : netio[340]: %PKT_INFRA-spp-4-PKT_ALLOC_FAIL : Failed to allocate 1 packets for sending    ``` For a final confirmation on whether this message does indicate exploitation of this issue, please contact your support organization.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:      <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.  **Customers Without Service Contracts**  Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.  **Fixed Releases**  This vulnerability has been corrected in Cisco IOS XR Software Release 6.3.2 and later.      Software maintenance upgrades (SMUs) for Cisco Aggregation Services Router (ASR) 9000 Series have also been made available that address this vulnerability.       | **IOS XR Release** | **SMU ID** | **ASR 9000 SMU Name** |   | --- | --- | --- |   | 5.3.4 | AA14136 | [asr9k-px-5.3.4.CSCvi35625.tar](https://software.cisco.com/download/release.html?mdfid=282414851&softwareid=280867577&release=5.3.4) 1 |   | 6.1.4 | AA14137 | [asr9k-px-6.1.4.CSCvi35625.tar](https://software.cisco.com/download/release.html?mdfid=282414851&softwareid=280867577&release=6.1.4) |   | 6.2.3 | AA14138 | [asr9k-px-6.2.3.CSCvi35625.tar](https://software.cisco.com/download/release.html?mdfid=282414851&softwareid=280867577&release=6.2.3) |         1 **Note**: An SMU including a partial fix named "asr9k-px-5.3.4.CSCvh49341.tar" was made available for a short time for Cisco IOS XR Software Release 5.3.4.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 7.4 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 7.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 7.4 |
