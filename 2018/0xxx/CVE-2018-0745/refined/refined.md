The provided content is related to CVE-2018-0745.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `nt!NtQueryInformationProcess` system call when invoked with information class 76 (specifically handled by `nt!PsQueryProcessEnergyValues`). The function discloses portions of uninitialized kernel stack memory to user-mode clients.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Kernel stack memory disclosure due to uninitialized data being returned to user mode.
- The specific bytes at offset 0x8c to 0x8f within the output buffer are not properly initialized.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Repeated exploitation can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information residing in kernel memory.
- The leaked information can potentially be used to defeat exploit mitigations such as Kernel ASLR, or to read other secrets stored in the kernel address space.

**Attack vectors:**
- A local authenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to execute code on the target system.
- Requires the ability to invoke the `NtQueryInformationProcess` system call with information class 76.
- The attacker can be a local, authenticated user.

**Additional details:**
- The provided exploit code fills a large portion of the kernel stack with a controlled marker byte using the `win32k!NtGdiEngCreatePalette` system call to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- On the test system (Windows 10 version 1709 32-bit), the output size was determined to be 0x1B0 (432) bytes.
- The vulnerability can be triggered via the `NtQueryInformationProcess` system call.
