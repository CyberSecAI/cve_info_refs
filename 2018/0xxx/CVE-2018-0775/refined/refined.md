{
  "CVE-2018-0775": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is triggered by the use of a 'with' statement within a JavaScript function, when the 'DeferParse' flag is enabled. The issue lies in how the JavaScript engine handles scopes during deferred parsing.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect scope handling during deferred parsing"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). The provided proof-of-concept code causes the JavaScript engine to crash when run.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Executing specially crafted JavaScript code with the 'DeferParse' flag enabled."
    ],
   "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript within the context of the vulnerable application (Microsoft Edge). The 'DeferParse' flag must be enabled, which can be achieved through specific engine settings or by using a long string of newline characters (`\\n`.repeat(0x1000)) or using the `-ForceDeferParse` command line argument."
