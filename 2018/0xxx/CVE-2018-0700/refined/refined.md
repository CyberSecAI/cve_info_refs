- The vulnerability stems from the way YukiWiki processes certain requests, which can lead to excessive CPU and memory usage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400):** The software does not properly manage resource allocation when handling specific requests, leading to resource exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service condition, making the affected system unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be initiated remotely over a network.
- A specific request needs to be crafted to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
- **No User Interaction:** The attack does not require user interaction.
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the vulnerable YukiWiki instance over the network.

**Summary of CVE-2018-0700:**
This vulnerability allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to send a crafted request to a YukiWiki server, causing it to consume excessive CPU and memory resources, leading to a denial of service. The vulnerability is due to improper resource management when handling specific requests.
