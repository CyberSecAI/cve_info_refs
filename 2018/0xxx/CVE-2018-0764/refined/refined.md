Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-0764

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper processing of XML documents within .NET Core.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability lies in how .NET Core handles XML document processing. It does not properly sanitize or validate XML documents, leading to potential issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can cause a denial of service against a .NET application by sending specially crafted XML requests. This can make the application unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
- Attackers can send specially crafted XML requests to a .NET Core application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable .NET Core application.
- No authentication is required; the attacker can be unauthenticated.

**Affected Software:**
- Microsoft .NET Core versions 1.0.x (prior to 1.0.9), 1.1.x (prior to 1.1.6), and 2.0.x (prior to 2.0.5).

**Mitigation:**
- Update .NET Core runtimes to versions 1.0.9, 1.1.6, and 2.0.5.
- Update .NET Core SDK to version 2.1.4 or 1.1.7 (SDK updates also include updated runtime).
- For self-contained applications: update the runtime/SDK, recompile the application, and redeploy.

**Additional Notes:**
- Red Hat has issued a security advisory (RHSA-2018:0379) to address this vulnerability in their .NET Core packages.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity by Red Hat.
- The fix corrects how .NET core handles XML document processing.
