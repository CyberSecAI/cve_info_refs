Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the "+Message" application's failure to properly verify SSL server certificates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure SSL Certificate Verification:** The app does not adequately validate the SSL/TLS certificates presented by servers, making it susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Eavesdropping:** An attacker could intercept and decrypt communications between the app and the server. This allows the attacker to steal message content and potentially other sensitive data transmitted via the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** The primary attack vector is a MITM attack, which is typically performed by positioning a malicious Wi-Fi access point between the user's device and the legitimate server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Control:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic, such as by controlling a Wi-Fi access point or having access to the network infrastructure.
- **Technical Skill:** The attacker needs the expertise to set up a malicious access point and perform the necessary steps to intercept and potentially decrypt SSL/TLS traffic.
