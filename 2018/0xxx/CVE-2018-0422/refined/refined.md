Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from overly permissive folder permissions in the Cisco Webex Meetings client for Windows. These permissions allow any user on the system to read, write, and execute files within the Webex installation directories.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Folder Permissions:** The primary weakness is the granting of broad read, write, and execute permissions to the Webex client folders, which allows any local user to manipulate files within those directories.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By writing malicious files to these folders, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of another user who later executes those malicious files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local File Modification:** An attacker can modify locally stored files within the Webex directory.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting malicious code, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the system, with the privilege level of another user.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Although the initial exploit occurs with the attacker's privilege level, when another user executes the malicious file, the code runs with that second user's permissions, potentially elevating privileges.
*   **Multi-user System Risk:**  The risk of exploitation is higher on multi-user systems, as the folder permissions affect all users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the Windows system where the vulnerable Webex client is installed.
*   **File Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to write malicious files to the Webex installation directory.
*   **User Interaction (Secondary):**  A secondary user must execute the malicious file for the arbitrary code execution and privilege escalation to occur.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Local User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the target Windows system.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker must have the ability to write files to the Webex directories.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple Webex Meeting products including Webex Meetings Suite (WBS31, WBS32, WBS33), Webex Meetings and Webex Meetings Server when running on Microsoft Windows.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
*   There are no workarounds.
*   The vulnerability does not affect Cisco Webex Meetings client applications running on macOS or Linux.
*   The CVSS score is 7.3 (High) with a vector string of CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
