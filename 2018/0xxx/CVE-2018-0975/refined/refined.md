  "response": {
    "root_cause": "The `nt!NtQueryFullAttributesFile` system call, when invoked with specific kernel object paths, discloses uninitialized kernel stack memory to user-mode clients. This occurs because the output structure `FILE_NETWORK_OPEN_INFORMATION` has padding bytes that are not initialized before being copied to user mode.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Uninitialized memory disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "Local authenticated attackers can repeatedly trigger the vulnerability to leak kernel stack memory. This could be used to defeat kernel ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) and potentially leak other secrets stored in kernel address space.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Invoking the `nt!NtQueryFullAttributesFile` system call with specific object paths such as `\\GLOBAL??\\D:\\`, `\\GLOBAL??\\CdRom0\\`, `\\GLOBAL??\\FltMgr`, `\\GLOBAL??\\FltMgr\\`, `\\GLOBAL??\\MAILSLOT\\`, `\\GLOBAL??\\Volume{GUID}\\`, `\\GLOBAL??\\PIPE\\`, `\\Device\\CdRom0\\`, `\\Device\\NamedPipe\\`, and `\\Device\\Mailslot\\`."
