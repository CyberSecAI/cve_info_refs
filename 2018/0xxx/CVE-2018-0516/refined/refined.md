- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The "FLET'S v4 / v6 address selection tool" application and its self-extracting archive have a DLL search path issue, leading to insecure loading of Dynamic Link Libraries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure DLL loading ([CWE-427](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html)).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user invoking the application.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to place a malicious DLL file in a specific folder where the application might load it from. The user must then run the application or self-extracting archive, which will load the malicious DLL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in a location where the vulnerable application will load it. This likely requires local file system access. User interaction is required to execute the vulnerable application.
