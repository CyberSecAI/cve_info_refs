{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Missing check for impersonation level in NtImpersonateAnonymousToken.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The function `NtImpersonateAnonymousToken` does not properly check the impersonation level of the token, leading to the possibility of impersonating a less restricted non-AC anonymous token when an AC token is expected.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Elevation of privilege. By impersonating the less restricted non-AC anonymous token, an attacker can gain access to objects with NULL DACLs, open devices, access/modify the anonymous token's device map, and potentially bypass symbolic link protections.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited when a split-token admin requests their linked token and impersonates it, which results in impersonating a non-AC anonymous token.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be a UAC split-token admin. They need to be able to get a non-AC token by requesting the linked token."
