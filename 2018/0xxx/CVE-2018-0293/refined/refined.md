Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-0293:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from incorrect Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) privilege assignments for certain Command Line Interface (CLI) commands within Cisco NX-OS Software. Specifically, a user with the "network-operator" role could execute commands that should be restricted to the "network-admin" role.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper authorization/privilege management due to flawed RBAC implementation.
- Non-administrative users can execute commands that should be restricted to administrative users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could execute privileged CLI commands, which could lead to:
  - Modification of device configuration.
  - Modification of the boot image on the device.
  - Potential for complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote and network-based.
- The attacker needs to authenticate to the device using valid user credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have valid user credentials for a non-administrative account (e.g., "network-operator") on the affected Cisco NX-OS device.
- Network access to the affected device is also required.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects various Cisco products running vulnerable versions of Cisco NX-OS Software, including:
    - MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches
    - Nexus 2000, 3000, 3500, 3600, 5500, 5600, 6000, 7000, 7700, and 9000 series switches (in standalone NX-OS mode)
    - Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules
- The vulnerability can be verified by checking the roles assigned to users using the "show user-account" command on the device.
- There are no workarounds available to mitigate this vulnerability.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this issue, and users are advised to upgrade to the fixed software versions.
