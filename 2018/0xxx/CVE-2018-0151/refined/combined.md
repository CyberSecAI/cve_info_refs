* **CVSS v3 9.8**
* **ATTENTION**: Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit.
* **Vendor**: Rockwell Automation
* **Equipment**: Allen-Bradley Stratix 5900 Services Router
* **Vulnerabilities**: Improper Input Validation, Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, Use of Externally-Controlled Format String.

## 2. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in loss of availability, confidentiality, and/or integrity caused by memory exhaustion, module restart, information corruption, and/or information exposure.

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following versions of Allen-Bradley Stratix Services Router use a vulnerable version of Cisco IOS or IOS XE:

* Allen-Bradley Stratix 5900 Services Router, version 15.6.3M1 and earlier.

### 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

### 3.2.1   [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)

A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) module of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a memory leak or a reload of an affected device that leads to a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of certain IKEv2 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IKEv2 packets to an affected device to be processed. A successful exploit could cause an affected device to continuously consume memory and eventually reload, resulting in a DoS condition.

[CVE-2018-0158](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-0158) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

### 3.2.2   [IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE-119](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)

A vulnerability in the quality of service (QoS) subsystem of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a DoS condition or execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

The vulnerability is due to incorrect bounds checking of certain values in packets that are destined for UDP port 18999 of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious packets to an affected device. When the packets are processed, an exploitable buffer overflow condition may occur. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device with elevated privileges. The attacker could also leverage this vulnerability to cause the device to reload, causing a temporary DoS condition while the device is reloading.

The malicious packets must be destined to and processed by an affected device. Traffic transiting a device will not trigger the vulnerability.

[CVE-2018-0151](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-0151) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

### 3.2.3  [IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE-119](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)

A buffer overflow vulnerability in the LLDP subsystem of Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XE Software, and Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an adjacent, unauthenticated attacker to cause a DoS condition or execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Rockwell Automation has released knowledge base article 1073313 which can be found at the following location:

<https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1073313/> (login required)

Cisco has released Snort Rules 46110 and 46111 to help address CVE-2018-0158 and CVE-2018-0151. See new rules at:

<https://www.cisco.com/web/software/286271056/117258/sf-rules-2018-03-29-new.html>

CVE-2018-0151: Users who do not use the Adaptive QoS for DMVPN feature can deny all traffic destined to UDP port 18999 on an affected device by using a Control Plane Policing (CoPP) policy. If the Adaptive QoS for DMVPN feature is later configured, the device must be upgraded to an unaffected release of Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software and the CoPP policy must be removed.

CVE-2018-0167 and CVE-2018-0175 have no specific mitigations in place. See the following Cisco Vulnerability advisory for more details:

<https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-lldp>

Rockwell Automation also recommends that users implement the following general security guidelines:

* Help minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and confirm that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS-CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the [ICS-CERT website.](/ics/)

Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software.  For information about which Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fixed) section of this advisory. Assessing a Device To determine whether a device that is running Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software may be affected by this vulnerability, administrators can log in to the device and use the **show udp** command in the CLI. On devices that do not support the **show udp** command, the show **ip sockets** command may be used as an alternative.  The device may be affected by this vulnerability if the **show udp** command returns output similar to the following example:  ```   Router> show udp      Proto  Remote   Port   Local   Port  In Out  Stat TTY OutputIF   17     0.0.0.0   0    --any--  18999  0   0    11   0      ```  The Adaptive QoS for Dynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN) feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software uses UDP port 18999 and may be open due to the provisioning of this feature on unaffected platforms. If UDP port 18999 is bound to a listening port on a device, use the Cisco IOS Software Checker to determine whether the device is running a vulnerable software release. Determining the Cisco IOS Software Release To determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the **show version** command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to *Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software* or *Cisco IOS Software*. The banner also displays the installed image name in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.5(2)T1 and has an installed image name of *C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M*:  ```   Router> show version      Cisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)   Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport   Copyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.   Compiled Mon 22-Jun-15 09:32 by prod_rel_team   .   .   .   ```  For information about the naming and numbering conventions for Cisco IOS Software releases, see the [Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/ios-nx-os-reference-guide.html). Determining the Cisco IOS XE Software Release To determine which Cisco IOS XE Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the **show version** command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS XE Software, the system banner displays *Cisco IOS Software*, *Cisco IOS XE Software*, or similar text.  The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 16.2.1 and has an installed image name of *CAT3K\_CAA-UNIVERSALK9-M*:  ```   ios-xe-device# show version      Cisco IOS Software, Catalyst L3 Switch Software (CAT3K_CAA-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version Denali 16.2.1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)   Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport   Copyright (c) 1986-2016 by Cisco Systems, Inc.   Compiled Sun 27-Mar-16 21:47 by mcpre   .   .   .   ```  For information about the naming and numbering conventions for Cisco IOS XE Software releases, see the [Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/ios-nx-os-reference-guide.html). Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco IOS XR Software or Cisco NX-OS Software.  Workarounds  * The following workaround is applicable on devices that support configurable inbound ports for Control Plane Policing (CoPP). Some families of Cisco devices such as the Cisco ASR 900 Series support CoPP only on specific ports and protocols. On these platforms, no workaround is available and customers should upgrade to a fixed software version.  Customers who do not use the Adaptive QoS for DMVPN feature can deny all traffic destined to UDP port 18999 on an affected device by using a CoPP policy similar to the following:  ```   ! -- ACL for CoPP Undesirable UDP class-map   ! -- Ignore fragments to prevent them from being misclassified by the policy     access-list 199 deny ip any any fragments   ! -- Classify traffic destined to UDP Port 18999 so that we can drop it prior to being processed     access-list 199 permit udp any any eq 18999      ! -- CoPP Undesirable UDP class-map   class-map match-all undesirable-udp    match access-group 199      ! -- Undesirable UDP Policy Map   policy-map drop-udp    class undesirable-udp     drop      ! -- Apply Undesirable UDP policy Map   control-plane    service-policy input drop-udp      ```  On platforms that do not support the **drop** keyword within the Policy Map, customers may consider using a policy similar to the following as an alternative:  ```   ! -- ACL for CoPP Undesirable UDP class-map   ! -- Ignore fragments to prevent them from being misclassified by the policy     access-list 199 deny ip any any fragments   ! -- Classify traffic destined to UDP Port 18999 so that we can drop it prior to being processed     access-list 199 permit udp any any eq 18999      ! -- CoPP Undesirable UDP class-map   class-map match-all undesirable-udp    match access-group 199      ! -- Undesirable UDP Policy Map - Drop on Police Rate   policy-map drop-udp    class undesirable-udp     police rate 8000      conform-action drop      exceed-action drop      violate-action drop      ! -- Apply Undesirable UDP policy Map   control-plane    service-policy input drop-udp      ```  If the Adaptive QoS for DMVPN feature is later configured, the device must be upgraded to an unaffected release of Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software and the CoPP policy must be removed.  Customers integrating this workaround into their environment are encouraged to test the adaptation in their lab prior to deployment and to reference the CoPP Best Practice Document at the following link: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/copp-best-practices.html>  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.  **Customers Without Service Contracts**  Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.          Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides a tool, the [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x), that identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).  Customers can use this tool to perform the following tasks:    + Initiate a search by choosing one or more releases from a drop-down list or uploading a file from a local system for the tool to parse   + Enter the output of the **show version** command for the tool to parse   + Create a custom search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication To determine whether a release is affected by any published Cisco Security Advisory, use the [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) on Cisco.com or enter a Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software release-for example, **15.1(4)M2** or **3.13.8S**-in the following field:               For a mapping of Cisco IOS XE Software releases to Cisco IOS Software releases, refer to the [Cisco IOS XE 2 Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/2/release/notes/rnasr21/rnasr21_gen.html#wp3000032), [Cisco IOS XE 3S Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/3/release/notes/asr1k_rn_3s_rel_notes/asr1k_rn_3s_sys_req.html#wp3069754), or [Cisco IOS XE 3SG Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL_24726.html#pgfId-2570252), depending on the Cisco IOS XE Software release.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High     Base Score: 9.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 9.8 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined      Environmental Score: 9.8 |

"text": "A vulnerability in the quality of service (QoS) subsystem of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition or execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to incorrect bounds checking of certain values in packets that are destined for UDP port 18999 of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious packets to an affected device. When the packets are processed, an exploitable buffer overflow condition may occur. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device with elevated privileges. The attacker could also leverage this vulnerability to cause the device to reload, causing a temporary DoS condition while the device is reloading.\r\n\r\nThe malicious packets must be destined to and processed by an affected device. Traffic transiting a device will not trigger the vulnerability.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds for most affected Cisco products that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-qos [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-qos\"]\r\nThis advisory is part of the March 28, 2018, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 20 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 22 vulnerabilities.

"text": "This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software.\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fixed\"] section of this advisory.\r\n Assessing a Device\r\nTo determine whether a device that is running Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software may be affected by this vulnerability, administrators can log in to the device and use the show udp command in the CLI. On devices that do not support the show udp command, the show ip sockets command may be used as an alternative.\r\n\r\nThe device may be affected by this vulnerability if the show udp command returns output similar to the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter> show udp\r\n Proto Remote Port Local Port In Out Stat TTY OutputIF 17 0.0.0.0 0 --any-- 18999 0 0 11 0\r\n\r\nThe Adaptive QoS for Dynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN) feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software uses UDP port 18999 and may be open due to the provisioning of this feature on unaffected platforms. If UDP port 18999 is bound to a listening port on a device, use the Cisco IOS Software Checker to determine whether the device is running a vulnerable software release.\r\n Determining the Cisco IOS Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software or Cisco IOS Software. The banner also displays the installed image name in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the show version command or may provide different output.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.5(2)T1 and has an installed image name of C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter> show version\r\n Cisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1) Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport Copyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.

"text": "The following workaround is applicable on devices that support configurable inbound ports for Control Plane Policing (CoPP). Some families of Cisco devices such as the Cisco ASR 900 Series support CoPP only on specific ports and protocols. On these platforms, no workaround is available and customers should upgrade to a fixed software version.\r\n\r\nCustomers who do not use the Adaptive QoS for DMVPN feature can deny all traffic destined to UDP port 18999 on an affected device by using a CoPP policy similar to the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n! -- ACL for CoPP Undesirable UDP class-map\r\n! -- Ignore fragments to prevent them from being misclassified by the policy access-list 199 deny ip any any fragments ! -- Classify traffic destined to UDP Port 18999 so that we can drop it prior to being processed access-list 199 permit udp any any eq 18999 ! -- CoPP Undesirable UDP class-map class-map match-all undesirable-udp match access-group 199 ! -- Undesirable UDP Policy Map policy-map drop-udp class undesirable-udp drop ! -- Apply Undesirable UDP policy Map control-plane service-policy input drop-udp\r\n\r\nOn platforms that do not support the drop keyword within the Policy Map, customers may consider using a policy similar to the following as an alternative:\r\n\r\n\r\n! -- ACL for CoPP Undesirable UDP class-map\r\n! -- Ignore fragments to prevent them from being misclassified by the policy access-list 199 deny ip any any fragments ! -- Classify traffic destined to UDP Port 18999 so that we can drop it prior to being processed access-list 199 permit udp any any eq 18999 ! -- CoPP Undesirable UDP class-map class-map match-all undesirable-udp match access-group 199 ! -- Undesirable UDP Policy Map - Drop on Police Rate policy-map drop-udp class undesirable-udp police rate 8000 conform-action drop exceed-action drop violate-action drop ! -- Apply Undesirable UDP policy Map control-plane service-policy input drop-udp\r\n\r\nIf the Adaptive QoS for DMVPN feature is later configured, the device must be upgraded to an unaffected release of Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software and the CoPP policy must be removed.\r\n\r\nCustomers integrating this workaround into their environment are encouraged to test the adaptation in their lab prior to deployment and to reference the CoPP Best Practice Document at the following link: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/copp-best-practices.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/copp-best-practices.html\"]"

Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides a tool, the Cisco IOS Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"], that identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (���First Fixed���). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (���Combined First Fixed���).\r\n\r\nCustomers can use this tool to perform the following tasks:\r\n\r\nInitiate a search by choosing one or more releases from a drop-down list or uploading a file from a local system for the tool to parse\r\nEnter the output of the show version command for the tool to parse\r\nCreate a custom search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a release is affected by any published Cisco Security Advisory, use the Cisco IOS Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] on Cisco.com or enter a Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software release���for example, 15.1(4)M2 or 3.13.8S���in the following field:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a mapping of Cisco IOS XE Software releases to Cisco IOS Software releases, refer to the Cisco IOS XE 2 Release Notes [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios\_xe/2/release/notes/rnasr21/rnasr21\_gen.html#wp3000032\"], Cisco IOS XE 3S Release Notes [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios\_xe/3/release/notes/asr1k\_rn\_3s\_rel\_notes/asr1k\_rn\_3s\_sys\_req.html#wp3069754\"], or Cisco IOS XE 3SG Release Notes [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL\_24726.html#pgfId-2570252\"], depending on the Cisco IOS XE Software release."
