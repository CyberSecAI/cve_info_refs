Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-0471

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of certain Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) packets in Cisco IOS XE Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Memory Leak:** The core issue is a memory leak caused by the improper handling of specific CDP packets.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** This memory leak can lead to a denial of service condition as the device consumes excessive memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Memory Exhaustion:** A successful exploit causes the affected device to continuously consume memory.
*   **Device Crash:**  The continuous memory consumption leads to a memory allocation failure, causing the device to crash.
*  **Device Reload:** The crash will trigger a reload of the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Adjacent Network:** An attacker on the same network segment as the vulnerable device can send malicious CDP packets.
*   **Unauthenticated:** No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be on a network that is adjacent to the vulnerable device.
*   The attacker does not require any special privileges or authentication. They can send the specially crafted CDP packets directly.

**Affected Products:**
*   Cisco IOS XE Software Releases 16.6.1 and 16.6.2 with the CDP feature enabled on at least one interface.
    * The CDP feature is enabled by default on all interfaces in Cisco IOS XE.

**Indicators of Compromise:**
*   Logs will show a "%SYS-2-MALLOCFAIL" message referencing the "CDP Protocol" process.
*   The device may reload and generate a crashinfo file.

**Workarounds:**
*   No workarounds address the vulnerability directly.
*   Administrators can disable the CDP feature globally using the `no cdp run` command or on specific interfaces using the `no cdp enable` command to prevent exploitation if it's not a required feature.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
* Cisco has released free software updates to address this vulnerability.
