Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-0630:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an **OS Command Injection** flaw.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-78:** Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection'). This means the device fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input that is used to construct operating system commands, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker with administrative privileges on the affected Aterm W300P device can execute arbitrary OS commands. This could allow the attacker to take full control of the device, modify settings, or cause denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is **adjacent** (AV:A), meaning an attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable device, or have access to it through a network connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have **high privileges** (PR:H) on the affected device which means they must already have administrative access. This suggests the vulnerability likely resides in an interface or service that requires authentication, though specifics aren't provided.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Aterm W300P firmware versions 1.0.13 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability is one of multiple discovered in the device, including buffer overflows (CVE-2018-0632 and CVE-2018-0633), and other OS command injection flaws (CVE-2018-0629, CVE-2018-0631).
*   The vulnerability was reported to IPA by Taizoh Tsukamoto of Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc.

The provided information gives a good overview of the vulnerability. It is an OS Command Injection vulnerability which requires local network access and administrative access to exploit.
