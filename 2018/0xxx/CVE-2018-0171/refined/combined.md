The vulnerability is due to improper validation of packet data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted Smart Install message to an affected device on TCP port 4786. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow on the affected device, which could have the following impacts:    + Triggering a reload of the device   + Allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device   + Causing an indefinite loop on the affected device that triggers a watchdog crash Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Smart Install client functionality is enabled by default on switches that are running Cisco IOS Software releases that have not been updated to address Cisco bug ID [CSCvd36820](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvd36820).  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-smi2>  This advisory is part of the March 28, 2018, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 20 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 22 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: March 2018 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-66682).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software and have the Smart Install client feature enabled.  Only Smart Install client switches are affected by the vulnerability that is described in this advisory. Cisco devices that are configured as a Smart Install director are not affected by this vulnerability.  For a list of devices that support Smart Install, see [Smart Install Configuration Guide - Supported Devices](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/smart_install/configuration/guide/smart_install/supported_devices.html).  For information about which Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fixed) section of this advisory. Notes Regarding Specific Releases Smart Install client functionality is enabled by default on switches that are running Cisco IOS Software releases that have not been updated to address Cisco bug ID [CSCvd36820](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvd36820).  Switches that are running releases earlier than Cisco IOS Software Release 12.2(52)SE are not capable of running Smart Install, but they can be Smart Install clients if they support the **archive download-sw** privileged EXEC command. Determining Whether the Smart Install Client Feature Is Enabled To determine whether a device is configured with the Smart Install client feature enabled, use the **show vstack config** privileged EXEC command on the Smart Install client. An output of *Role: Client* and *Oper Mode: Enabled* or *Role: Client (SmartInstall enabled)* from the **show vstack config** command confirms that the feature is enabled on the device.  The following examples show the output of the **show vstack config** command on Cisco Catalyst Switches that are configured as Smart Install clients:  ```   switch1# show vstack config Role: Client (SmartInstall enabled) . . .switch2# show vstack config Capability: Client Oper Mode: Enabled Role: Client . . .   ```  Determining the Cisco IOS Software Release To determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the **show version** command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to *Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software* or *Cisco IOS Software*. The banner also displays the installed image name in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.5(2)T1 and has an installed image name of *C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M*:  ```   Router> show version      Cisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)   Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport   Copyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco IOS XR Software or Cisco NX-OS Software.  Details  * Cisco Smart Install is a “plug-and-play” configuration and image-management feature that provides zero-touch deployment for new (typically access layer) switches. The feature allows a customer to ship a Cisco switch to any location, install it in the network, and power it on without additional configuration requirements. The Smart Install feature incorporates no authentication by design.  A Smart Install network consists of exactly one Smart Install director switch or router, also known as an *integrated branch director (IBD)*, and one or more Smart Install client switches, also known as *integrated branch clients (IBCs)*. A client switch does not need to be directly connected to the director; the client switch can be up to seven hops away.  The director provides a single management point for images and configuration of client switches. When a client switch is first installed in the network, the director automatically detects the new switch and identifies the correct Cisco IOS Software image and the configuration file for downloading. The director can also allocate an IP address and hostname to a client.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability for customers who require the use of Cisco Smart Install. For customers not requiring Cisco Smart Install, the feature can be disabled with the **no vstack command**. In software releases that are associated with Cisco Bug ID [CSCvd36820](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvd36820), Cisco Smart Install will auto-disable if not in use.  Administrators are encouraged to consult the informational security advisory on [Cisco Smart Install Protocol Misuse](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170214-smi) and the [Smart Install Configuration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/smart_install/configuration/guide/smart_install/concepts.html#23355).  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.  **Customers Without Service Contracts**  Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.          Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides a tool, the [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x), that identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).  Customers can use this tool to perform the following tasks:    + Initiate a search by choosing one or more releases from a drop-down list or uploading a file from a local system for the tool to parse   + Enter the output of the **show version** command for the tool to parse   + Create a custom search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication To determine whether a release is affected by any published Cisco Security Advisory, use the [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) on Cisco.com or enter a Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software release-for example, **15.1(4)M2** or **3.13.8S**-in the following field:               For a mapping of Cisco IOS XE Software releases to Cisco IOS Software releases, refer to the [Cisco IOS XE 2 Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/2/release/notes/rnasr21/rnasr21_gen.html#wp3000032), [Cisco IOS XE 3S Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/3/release/notes/asr1k_rn_3s_rel_notes/asr1k_rn_3s_sys_req.html#wp3069754), or [Cisco IOS XE 3SG Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL_24726.html#pgfId-2570252), depending on the Cisco IOS XE Software release.

[This story was updated on 4/10/18 with Cisco's comments]

Cisco is urging organizations to immediately address a critical flaw in its network switches running IOS and IOS XE software amid reports of widespread attacks against the devices in several countries.

The company on Monday published a [security advisory](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-smi2#fixed) on the remote code execution flaw ([CVE-2018-0171](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-0171)) in the Smart Install function in Cisco IOS and IOS XE software.

Cisco described the flaw — first disclosed March 29 by [Embedi](https://embedi.com/blog/cisco-smart-install-remote-code-execution/) — as an issue that could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to trigger a denial-of-service condition or to execute code of their choice on an affected device. Emedi on March 29 claimed it had found some 250,000 network devices that were vulnerable to the issue.

The RCE flaw is separate from a protocol misuse issue also related to the Smart Install function that Cisco first issued an advisory about on [Feb 14, 2017](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170214-smi) and has updated a couple of times. It is apparently the protocol misuse issue that attackers have been exploiting in the recent attacks,  not the RCE flaw.

However, Cisco has urged organizations to address both issues immediately, citing widespread and ongoing attacks against its switches in multiple countries. "While we have only observed attacks leveraging the protocol misuse issue, recently, another vulnerability in the Cisco Smart Install Client was disclosed and patched," the company said in a [blog](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/04/critical-infrastructure-at-risk.html). "While mitigating the protocol misuse issue, customers should also address this vulnerability."

'Don't Mess With Our Elections'

[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-cyber-hackers/iran-hit-by-global-cyber-attack-that-left-u-s-flag-on-screens-idUSKBN1HE0MH) over the weekend reported that some 200,000 Cisco switches had been compromised in attacks in multiple countries. Among those impacted were data centers and ISPs in Iran and Russia where the attackers displayed a US flag on the screens of compromised systems with the message, "Don't mess with our elections."

IRNA, Iran's official news agency [said](http://www.irna.ir/en/News/82879428) the attacks impacted at least 3,500 routers in the country. The agency quoted cybersecurity officials within the country as saying that attackers had tampered with configuration settings on the devices to cause systems to become unavailable.

Cisco had first warned about the protocol misuse issue that the threat actors leveraged in the attacks last February. The company has described the issue as something that attackers can abuse to modify the TFTP server setting to steal and modify configuration files, replace the operating system image, and set up command.

"Although this is not a vulnerability in the classic sense, the misuse of this protocol is an attack vector that should be mitigated immediately," Cisco had noted in an [April 5 blog](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/04/critical-infrastructure-at-risk.html) warning about the surge recent attacks targeting the issue.

According to the company, attackers have been using search engines like Shodan to scan for vulnerable devices throughout 2017 and the early part of this year. Though, Cisco has long ago provided instructions on how organizations can find vulnerable routers and mitigate the protocol misuse issue, some 168,000 devices worldwide remain exposed to the issue when Cisco conducted a recent scan. These devices need to be addressed immediately, the company has noted.

Cisco said that several threat actors, including nation-state groups like the [Dragonfly campaign](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-074A) targeting western energy firms have been exploiting the protocol issue in widespread attacks in countries. Some of the attacks have targeted critical infrastructure organizations, Cisco has warned.

Update

In an emailed response to questions from Dark Reading, a Cisco spokesperson said the timing of multiple recent advisories on the Smart Install issue may have caused some confusion over what exactly is going on. She confirmed that the recent attacks indeed involve the Smart Install protocol issue and not the Smart Install Denial of Service or Remote Code Execution flaws described in CVE-2018-0171.

"At this time, the Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in these advisories."

Cisco's PSIRT [published a document](https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/rRrXC6XAAIPpjqyHmRAAK?domain=tools.cisco.com) after this Dark Reading report posted, clarifying all the potential issues involving Smart Install with advice on how organizations can determine if they are impacted and what steps need to be taken.

"To ensure their network is protected against issues involving Smart Install, our recommendation for customers not actually using Smart Install is to disable the feature using the 'no vstack' command once setup is complete," she says.

"Customers who do use the feature – and leave it enabled – can use ACLs to block incoming traffic on TCP port 4786 (the proper security control). And additionally, patches for known security vulnerabilities should be applied as part of standard network security management."

So far, there is no evidence that the RCE flaw in Smart Install has been exploited. However, proof-of-concept code for exploiting is available. The vulnerability stems from improper validation of packet data. Attackers can exploit it by sending a specially crafted Smart Install message to a vulnerable device via TCP port 4786 causing the device to reload. Attackers could also exploit the flaw to execute arbitrary code or to cause a denial of service condition, Cisco said.

Prior to Cisco's new post, some security researchers said that the newly revealed flaw appears to be different from the one being exploited.

"This attack took advantage of Cisco’s Smart Install protocol," says Bob Noel, director of strategic relationships and marketing for Plixer. "Organizations were provided guidance that Cisco did not consider this a vulnerability, and therefore no changes would be done to the protocol."

Organizations were instructed to simply turn off the protocol, and those that remain exposed are those who have not done so, he says.

The damage an attacker could do with this would depend on their access privileges. By changing the startup configuration, an attacker could force a reboot of a switch and stop all traffic forwarding. "In a case where an attacker gained full administrative rights to a router/switch, they would be able to change the configuration of the device, add or remove security policies, or make any other changes," Noel says.

Ashley Stephenson, CEO of Corero Network Security, says available evidence suggests attackers would not have needed to exploit the RCE flaw in the recent attacks. "While there is no proof, this was likely accomplished by just misusing the protocol," he says.

The attacks show why it is important for organizations to understand the profile of systems exposed to the Internet. If it is exposed, someone will attempt to compromise it. "There is no excuse for exposing unnecessary ports or services, like TCP 4786 for Cisco Smart Install Client," Stephenson says.

## 2. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in loss of availability, confidentiality, and/or integrity caused by memory exhaustion, module restart, information corruption, and/or information exposure.

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following versions of Allen-Bradley Stratix Industrial Managed Ethernet Switch use a vulnerable version of Cisco IOS or IOS XE:

* Allen-Bradley Stratix 8300 Industrial Managed Ethernet Switches, versions 15.2(4a)EA5 and earlier.

### 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

### 3.2.1   [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)

A vulnerability in the Smart Install feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to trigger a reload of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition, or to execute arbitrary code on an affected device.

The vulnerability is due to improper validation of packet data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted Smart Install message to an affected device on TCP port 4786. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow on the affected device.

[CVE-2018-0171](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-0171) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

### 3.2.2   [RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ERRORS CWE-399](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/399.html)

A vulnerability in the Smart Install feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to trigger a reload of an affected device, resulting in a DoS condition.

The vulnerability is due to improper validation of packet data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted packet to an affected device on TCP port 4786.

[CVE-2018-0156](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-0156) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.6 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

### 3.2.3   [7PK – ERRORS CWE-388](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/388.html)

A vulnerability in the Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) offload implementation could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a crash of the iosd process, causing a DoS condition.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient error handling when the BFD header in a BFD packet is incomplete. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted BFD message to or across an affected switch. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a reload of the system.

[CVE-2018-0155](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-0155) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

### 3.2.4   [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)

A vulnerability in the DHCP option 82 encapsulation functionality of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.

The vulnerability exists because the affected software performs incomplete input validation of option 82 information that it receives in DHCP Version 4 (DHCPv4) packets from DHCP relay agents. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DHCPv4 packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.

[CVE-2018-0174](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-0174) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

### 3.2.5   [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)

A vulnerability in the DHCP option 82 encapsulation functionality of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.

The vulnerability exists because the affected software performs incomplete input validation of option 82 information that it receives in DHCP Version 4 (DHCPv4) packets from DHCP relay agents. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DHCPv4 packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a heap overflow condition on the affected device, which will cause the device to reload and result in a DoS condition.

[CVE-2018-0172](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-0172) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

### 3.2.6   [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)

A vulnerability in the Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software function that restores encapsulated option 82 information in DHCP Version 4 (DHCPv4) packets could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.

The vulnerability exists because the affected software performs incomplete input validation of encapsulated option 82 information that it receives in DHCPOFFER messages from DHCPv4 servers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DHCPv4 packet to an affected device, which the device would then forward to a DHCPv4 server. When the affected software processes the option 82 information that is encapsulated in the response from the server, an error could occur. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.

[CVE-2018-0173](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-0173) has been assigned to this vulnerability.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Rockwell Automation has released the following knowledge base article 1073315:

<https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1073315/> (login required)

Cisco has released new Snort Rules at <https://www.cisco.com/web/software/286271056/117258/sf-rules-2018-03-29-new.html> to help address the following vulnerabilities:

* CVE-2018-0171 - Snort Rule 46096 and 46097
* CVE-2018-0156 - Snort Rule 41725
* CVE-2018-0174 - Snort Rule 46120
* CVE-2018-0172 - Snort Rule 46104
* CVE-2018-0173 - Snort Rule 46119

Cisco adds the following notes for the Smart Install vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-0171 and CVE-2018-0156):

* Smart Install is turned off by express setup; however, upgraded switches but not re-setup may have it enabled.
* Disable the Smart Install feature with the no vstack configuration command if it is not needed or once setup is complete.
* Users who do use the feature—and need to leave it enabled—can use ACLs to block incoming traffic on TCP port 4786.

CVE-2018-0155: Administrators who do not use the BFD feature in their environments can disable the BFD feature by using the feature bfd disable command in global configuration mode to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. Administrators who do use the BFD feature can implement Control Plane Policing (CoPP) to allow processing of BFD packets from known BFD peers only and drop all other BFD traffic to limit exposure.

CVE-2018-0167 and CVE-2018-0175 have no specific mitigations in place. See the following Cisco advisory for more details:

<https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-lldp>

Rockwell Automation also recommends that users implement the following general security guidelines:

* Help minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and confirm that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS-CERT Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the [ICS-CERT website.](/ics/)

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 9.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 9.8 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 9.8 |

"text": "Cisco Smart Install is a “plug-and-play” configuration and image-management feature that provides zero-touch deployment for new (typically access layer) switches. The feature allows a customer to ship a Cisco switch to any location, install it in the network, and power it on without additional configuration requirements. The Smart Install feature incorporates no authentication by design.\r\n\r\nA Smart Install network consists of exactly one Smart Install director switch or router, also known as an integrated branch director (IBD), and one or more Smart Install client switches, also known as integrated branch clients (IBCs). A client switch does not need to be directly connected to the director; the client switch can be up to seven hops away.\r\n\r\nThe director provides a single management point for images and configuration of client switches. When a client switch is first installed in the network, the director automatically detects the new switch and identifies the correct Cisco IOS Software image and the configuration file for downloading. The director can also allocate an IP address and hostname to a client."

The vulnerability is due to improper validation of packet data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted Smart Install message to an affected device on TCP port 4786. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow on the affected device, which could have the following impacts:    + Triggering a reload of the device   + Allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device   + Causing an indefinite loop on the affected device that triggers a watchdog crash Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Smart Install client functionality is enabled by default on switches that are running Cisco IOS Software releases that have not been updated to address Cisco bug ID [CSCvd36820](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvd36820).  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-smi2>  This advisory is part of the March 28, 2018, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 20 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 22 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: March 2018 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-66682).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software and have the Smart Install client feature enabled.  Only Smart Install client switches are affected by the vulnerability that is described in this advisory. Cisco devices that are configured as a Smart Install director are not affected by this vulnerability.  For a list of devices that support Smart Install, see [Smart Install Configuration Guide - Supported Devices](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/smart_install/configuration/guide/smart_install/supported_devices.html).  For information about which Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fixed) section of this advisory. Notes Regarding Specific Releases Smart Install client functionality is enabled by default on switches that are running Cisco IOS Software releases that have not been updated to address Cisco bug ID [CSCvd36820](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvd36820).  Switches that are running releases earlier than Cisco IOS Software Release 12.2(52)SE are not capable of running Smart Install, but they can be Smart Install clients if they support the **archive download-sw** privileged EXEC command. Determining Whether the Smart Install Client Feature Is Enabled To determine whether a device is configured with the Smart Install client feature enabled, use the **show vstack config** privileged EXEC command on the Smart Install client. An output of *Role: Client* and *Oper Mode: Enabled* or *Role: Client (SmartInstall enabled)* from the **show vstack config** command confirms that the feature is enabled on the device.  The following examples show the output of the **show vstack config** command on Cisco Catalyst Switches that are configured as Smart Install clients:  ```   switch1# show vstack config Role: Client (SmartInstall enabled) . . .switch2# show vstack config Capability: Client Oper Mode: Enabled Role: Client . . .   ```  Determining the Cisco IOS Software Release To determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the **show version** command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to *Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software* or *Cisco IOS Software*. The banner also displays the installed image name in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.5(2)T1 and has an installed image name of *C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M*:  ```   Router> show version      Cisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)   Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport   Copyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.   Compiled Mon 22-Jun-15 09:32 by prod_rel_team   .   .   .   ```  For information about the naming and numbering conventions for Cisco IOS Software releases, see the [Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/ios-nx-os-reference-guide.html). Determining the Cisco IOS XE Software Release To determine which Cisco IOS XE Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the **show version** command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS XE Software, the system banner displays *Cisco IOS Software*, *Cisco IOS XE Software*, or similar text.  The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 16.2.1 and has an installed image name of *CAT3K\_CAA-UNIVERSALK9-M*:  ```   ios-xe-device# show version      Cisco IOS Software, Catalyst L3 Switch Software (CAT3K_CAA-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version Denali 16.2.1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)   Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport   Copyright (c) 1986-2016 by Cisco Systems, Inc.   Compiled Sun 27-Mar-16 21:47 by mcpre   .   .   .   ```  For information about the naming and numbering conventions for Cisco IOS XE Software releases, see the [Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/ios-nx-os-reference-guide.html). Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco IOS XR Software or Cisco NX-OS Software.  Details  * Cisco Smart Install is a “plug-and-play” configuration and image-management feature that provides zero-touch deployment for new (typically access layer) switches. The feature allows a customer to ship a Cisco switch to any location, install it in the network, and power it on without additional configuration requirements. The Smart Install feature incorporates no authentication by design.  A Smart Install network consists of exactly one Smart Install director switch or router, also known as an *integrated branch director (IBD)*, and one or more Smart Install client switches, also known as *integrated branch clients (IBCs)*. A client switch does not need to be directly connected to the director; the client switch can be up to seven hops away.  The director provides a single management point for images and configuration of client switches. When a client switch is first installed in the network, the director automatically detects the new switch and identifies the correct Cisco IOS Software image and the configuration file for downloading. The director can also allocate an IP address and hostname to a client.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability for customers who require the use of Cisco Smart Install. For customers not requiring Cisco Smart Install, the feature can be disabled with the **no vstack command**. In software releases that are associated with Cisco Bug ID [CSCvd36820](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvd36820), Cisco Smart Install will auto-disable if not in use.  Administrators are encouraged to consult the informational security advisory on [Cisco Smart Install Protocol Misuse](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170214-smi) and the [Smart Install Configuration Guide](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/smart_install/configuration/guide/smart_install/concepts.html#23355).  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.  **Customers Without Service Contracts**  Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.          Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides a tool, the [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x), that identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).  Customers can use this tool to perform the following tasks:    + Initiate a search by choosing one or more releases from a drop-down list or uploading a file from a local system for the tool to parse   + Enter the output of the **show version** command for the tool to parse   + Create a custom search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication To determine whether a release is affected by any published Cisco Security Advisory, use the [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) on Cisco.com or enter a Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software release-for example, **15.1(4)M2** or **3.13.8S**-in the following field:               For a mapping of Cisco IOS XE Software releases to Cisco IOS Software releases, refer to the [Cisco IOS XE 2 Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/2/release/notes/rnasr21/rnasr21_gen.html#wp3000032), [Cisco IOS XE 3S Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/3/release/notes/asr1k_rn_3s_rel_notes/asr1k_rn_3s_sys_req.html#wp3069754), or [Cisco IOS XE 3SG Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL_24726.html#pgfId-2570252), depending on the Cisco IOS XE Software release.
