Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0776:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how the Chakra JavaScript engine in Microsoft Edge handles stack-allocated variables when they need to be moved to the heap. Specifically, when a stack-allocated variable is accessed through the `arguments` object of a function, a copy is made on the heap. This copy mechanism, when combined with type confusion, leads to a vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-to-Heap Copy Issue:** When stack allocated variables are copied to the heap, the resulting heap-allocated variable maintains the same structure as the stack-allocated original.
- **Type Confusion:** Because the copied heap variable has the same structure, modifying the type of one variable can influence the other. This type confusion can happen when the code modifies the heap-allocated copy to be a variable array, while the stack-allocated original remains a float array. This leads to incorrect access and data corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) shows that the vulnerability can cause a crash.
- **Potential for arbitrary code execution:** Although not explicitly demonstrated in the PoC, type confusion bugs like this can potentially be exploited for more severe impacts like arbitrary code execution by overwriting memory locations with incorrect types.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of Microsoft Edge that triggers this stack-to-heap copy and type confusion.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within Microsoft Edge. This might involve:
    - Compromising a website that the target visits using Edge.
    - Tricking a user into opening a malicious HTML file.
    - Exploiting another vulnerability that leads to arbitrary JavaScript execution.

**Summary of the Exploit:**

The exploit leverages the following steps:

1.  **Stack Allocation:** A JavaScript array (`stack_arr`) is initially allocated on the stack.
2.  **Heap Copy:** The `inlinee` function accesses the `arguments` object, causing a copy of `stack_arr` to be made on the heap (`heap_arr`). The heap copy retains the same structure.
3.  **Type Conversion:** The heap-allocated copy is type-converted to a variable array. The original stack-allocated copy is not converted.
4.  **Type Confusion & Out-of-Bounds Access:** By accessing the stack array after the heap-allocated copy has been converted, the code attempts to write to memory locations with the incorrect type information. This can lead to a crash (DoS) or potentially further memory corruption.
