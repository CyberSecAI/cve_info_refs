Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-0968

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `nt!NtQueryVirtualMemory` system call when invoked with the `MemoryImageInformation` (0x6) information class. This system call, under specific conditions, leaks uninitialized kernel stack memory to user-mode clients.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Uninitialized Memory Disclosure:** The core weakness is that the `NtQueryVirtualMemory` syscall with `MemoryImageInformation` does not properly initialize the output buffer, specifically the last 4 bytes of a 24-byte output buffer, before copying it to user space, leading to information exposure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:**  An attacker can read kernel stack memory.
- **Exploit Mitigation Bypass:** This information disclosure can be used to bypass Kernel ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization).
- **Secret Leakage:**  Potentially sensitive data present in kernel memory can be leaked, such as kernel addresses or other security-sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by calling the `nt!NtQueryVirtualMemory` system call with the `MemoryImageInformation` (0x6) information class.
- The attacker must specify an output buffer of a specific size (24 bytes).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user to invoke the vulnerable system call.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects 64-bit versions of Windows 8 to 10.
- The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates the leakage by "spraying" the kernel stack with a known byte pattern and then triggering the vulnerability to expose the uninitialized bytes.
- The size of the output buffer is important (24 bytes) as the 4 bytes at the end of that buffer are the uninitialized bytes.
