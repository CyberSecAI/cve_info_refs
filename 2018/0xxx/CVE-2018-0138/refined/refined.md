- Failure to properly identify and block files transmitted via BitTorrent protocol.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass file policies configured to block files transmitted via the BitTorrent protocol.
- Successful exploitation allows the attacker to transfer files to the affected device, which should have been blocked.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attack over the network.
- Sending crafted BitTorrent connection requests to the affected device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the targeted device.
- No authentication or special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs the ability to craft BitTorrent handshake messages.
