Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-0088:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies within a diagnostic test CLI command in Cisco IOS Software for Industrial Ethernet 4010 Series Switches. This command allows an attacker to write to the device's memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The diagnostic test CLI command lacks proper input validation, enabling arbitrary memory writes.
- Lack of sufficient checks when writing to memory leads to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could overwrite system memory locations to execute arbitrary code.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Overwriting system memory can lead to device instability, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the device.
- **CLI Interface:** The attacker interacts with the device using the command-line interface (CLI).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid user credentials at privilege level 15 to access the diagnostic test CLI command.
- **Local access:**  The attacker needs to be able to execute commands on the device.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
- No workarounds are available, and users are advised to upgrade the software.
- There is no public announcement or known malicious use of this vulnerability.
- The CVSS base score is 6.7 (MEDIUM), with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
- Affected products include Cisco Industrial Ethernet 4010 Series Switches running Cisco IOS Software.
