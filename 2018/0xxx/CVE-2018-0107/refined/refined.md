Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0107:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection in the web framework of Cisco Prime Service Catalog.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The application lacks proper protection against CSRF attacks, which allows an attacker to induce a user into performing actions they did not intend to on the vulnerable application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can execute unwanted actions on an affected device. The specific unwanted actions are not detailed, however, the impact is an integrity impact with a CVSS base score of 5.3.
- The attacker could exploit the vulnerability by tricking a user of a web application into executing an adverse action.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely via the network.
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication to trigger the vulnerability.
- **User Interaction (UI:None):** While user interaction is needed in the general sense of a CSRF attack, no specific interaction from the user is needed for the vulnerability to be exploited. This means the user does not have to click a link, etc., but must merely be authenticated and browsing the site.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request to the web application.
- The attacker does not require any authentication credentials to exploit the vulnerability, but a valid user session is required.
- The attacker needs to trick a user with an active session to the vulnerable application into initiating a malicious request.

**Additional Notes:**
- There are no workarounds available to mitigate the vulnerability.
- Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N.
- The corresponding Cisco Bug ID is CSCvg30313.
