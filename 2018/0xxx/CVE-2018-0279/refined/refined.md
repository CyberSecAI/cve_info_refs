Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0279:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper input validation of command arguments in the Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) server of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The SCP server does not properly sanitize or validate command arguments provided during a connection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Shell Access:** A successful exploit allows a remote, authenticated attacker to gain shell access to the underlying Linux operating system of the affected device. This access is with a non-root user account.
- **Further Attacks:** Gaining shell access can enable the attacker to execute additional attacks that could significantly impact the affected system due to the system design.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
- **SCP Protocol:** Exploitation occurs through the SCP server.
- **Crafted Arguments:** The attacker needs to use specially crafted arguments when establishing a connection to the affected device via SCP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Cisco NFVIS system.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the affected device's SCP server (typically TCP port 22222).
