Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-0382:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper session identification management within the web-based interface of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software. Specifically, the software fails to clear previously assigned session identifiers when a user authenticates, leading to a potential security flaw.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Session Handling:** The core issue is that the software does not properly invalidate or clear old session identifiers upon new user authentication. This allows the reuse of stale session IDs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** A successful attack allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to hijack a valid, authenticated user's browser session on the affected system. This would grant the attacker access to the system with the privileges of the hijacked user.
*   **Integrity Impact:** The CVSS score indicates a Low integrity impact (I:L). This means that the attacker could potentially modify some data or system settings within the scope of the hijacked session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attack is conducted remotely (AV:N).
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the web interface of the Cisco WLC over the network.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need valid user credentials to initiate the attack (PR:N).
*   **No User Interaction Required:** No interaction from the legitimate user is needed (UI:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable Cisco WLC web interface.
*   **Existing Session ID:** The attacker needs to obtain a valid session identifier that was previously assigned to a legitimate user. This could be done through various means, such as eavesdropping on network traffic or exploiting other vulnerabilities.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   **No Workarounds:** There are no known workarounds to mitigate the vulnerability, requiring a software patch.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 5.3, classified as Medium severity, with a vector of  `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N`.
*   **No Known Public Exploitation:** At the time of the advisory, Cisco PSIRT was not aware of any public exploits or malicious use of this vulnerability.
*   **Vulnerable Products:** Only Cisco WLC software is affected, the advisory indicates to refer to Cisco Bug ID CSCvi25569 for specifics on vulnerable software releases.
*   **Fixed Software:** Refer to the Cisco Bug ID CSCvi25569 for information on fixed software releases and updates.
