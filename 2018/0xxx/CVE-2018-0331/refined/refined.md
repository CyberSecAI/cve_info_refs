- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Failure to properly validate certain fields within a Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) message prior to processing it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation within the CDP message handling subsystem.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on an affected device, potentially leading to device restart.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to be adjacent to the vulnerable device and able to send crafted CDP messages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be on the same network segment (adjacent) as the target and must be able to send specially crafted CDP messages. No authentication is required.
