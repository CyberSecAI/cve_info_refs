Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2018-0500:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `Curl_smtp_escape_eob()` function within the `lib/smtp.c` file of the `curl` library.
- The issue arises because the function uses the read buffer size instead of the upload buffer size to allocate memory for a scratch buffer.  The read buffer size can be set smaller than the upload buffer size, leading to an undersized allocation and subsequent buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow.
- Incorrect buffer size calculation during memory allocation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can cause `curl` to crash.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The overflow could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system (although not explicitly confirmed in all sources).
- **Memory Corruption:** The overflow can corrupt memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when `curl` is used to upload data over SMTP.
- Specifically, the attacker needs to control the data transmitted over SMTP and also influence the buffer size used by `curl`. This can happen if a non-standard `--limit-rate` argument or `CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE` value is used.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote attacker.
- Ability to send crafted data to a `curl` client over SMTP.
- Must be able to influence `curl`'s buffer size configuration, usually via nonstandard arguments or options.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability affects `curl` versions 7.54.1 up to and including 7.60.0.
- The vulnerable code was introduced in commit `e40e9d7f0decc79`.
- The fix involves using the `UPLOAD_BUFSIZE` constant for memory allocation instead of `data->set.buffer_size` (read buffer size). The fix was implemented in commit `ba1dbd78e5f1ed67c1b8d37ac89d90e5e330b628`.
- The vulnerability is in `lib/smtp.c`, specifically in the function `Curl_smtp_escape_eob`.
- Red Hat states that versions of `curl/libcurl` shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7, and Red Hat Software Collections 3 were not vulnerable because they did not include the vulnerable code.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to `curl` version 7.61.0 or later.
- Avoid using non-standard buffer sizes when using `curl` for SMTP uploads, if possible.

**CVSS Score:**
- Critical Severity
- CVSS v3 score of 9.8
- CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**EPSS Score:**
- 0.873%, meaning there's a relatively low, but not insignificant, chance of exploitation.
