Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0090:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A bad code fix in the 7.3.2 code train of Cisco NX-OS System Software causes traffic to the management interface to be misclassified and not match the configured Access Control Lists (ACLs).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Improper Access Control: The vulnerability lies in the incorrect processing of management interface traffic, leading to ACL bypass.
-  Incorrect traffic classification:  Traffic intended for the management interface is incorrectly classified and bypasses the ACLs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): By bypassing ACLs, an attacker can send crafted traffic directly to the NX-OS CPU for processing, leading to high CPU utilization and a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote: The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending crafted traffic to the management interface.
- Unauthenticated: The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Remote network access to the management interface of the affected Cisco NX-OS device.
- Ability to send crafted traffic to the management interface.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
