- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the `nt!NtQuerySystemInformation` system call, specifically when invoked with information class 138 (`QueryMemoryTopologyInformation`). This triggers the internal function `nt!ExpQueryMemoryTopologyInformation`, which returns uninitialized kernel pool memory to user-mode clients.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core weakness is the disclosure of uninitialized kernel pool memory. Specifically, three 4-byte chunks within a 112-byte output buffer are not properly initialized, containing leftover data from the kernel pool. The memory is allocated using `NonPagedPoolNx` in `nt!MmGetNodeChannelRanges`, and the size is determined by `nt!MiReferencePageRuns`.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Repeated exploitation could allow local authenticated attackers to defeat kernel ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) or read other secrets stored in the kernel address space, potentially leading to further compromise.

- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a local, authenticated user calling the `NtQuerySystemInformation` system call with information class 138.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to make system calls to the kernel. The provided PoC is a local exploit.
