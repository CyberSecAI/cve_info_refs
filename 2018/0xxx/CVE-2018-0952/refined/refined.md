{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Diagnostics Hub Packaging library, used by Windows Standard Collector Service, performs a file copy operation without impersonating the user. This allows a local attacker to redirect the copy operation to an arbitrary location using a mount point, leading to arbitrary file write.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of client impersonation during file copy operation",
      "TOCTOU vulnerability",
      "Arbitrary file write"
    ],
    "impact": "Privilege escalation. An attacker can gain SYSTEM privileges by writing a malicious DLL to a protected location and loading it via the collector service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access",
      "Abuse of Windows Diagnostic Hub Standard Collector Service"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must have a user account with the ability to create directories and files, and interact with the Windows Diagnostic Hub Standard Collector Service."
