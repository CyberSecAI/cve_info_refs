     ![Duane LaFlotte](/_astro/duane.CAyBZp_-.png)
### Duane LaFlotte

CTO, Pulsar Security

  I feel like every person's first experience in cybersecurity should be OffSec. Before you go out to figure out how to create a zero-day and you get confused, if you start with OffSec, that won't happen due to how methodologically all the training is put together.      ![Emile Kok](/_astro/emile.C3f2EqfQ.png)

Founder and Managing Director, TSTC Institute

  When going to the real world, you have to know what you're doing and understand what is expected from you on the job. For us, OffSec is the champion in this league in educating and preparing learners.      ![Douglas Costa](/_astro/douglas.BdxOPM2d.png)

### Summary

The Diagnostics Hub Packaging library, used by Windows Standard Collector Service, can be forced to copy an arbitrary file to an arbitrary location due to lack of client impersonation in `DiagnosticsHub.StandardCollector.Runtime.dll`.

Here is a detailed write-up on how this vulnerability was found and exploited: [Privilege Escalation Vulnerability in Windows Standard Collector Service](https://www.atredis.com/blog/cve-2018-0952-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-in-windows-standard-collector-service).

### Technical Details

The Standard Collector Service allows for a several values to be defined when configuring a diagnostics session, including the scratch directory and session ID. The session ID can be any GUID and the scratch directory can be any location the user has write permissions too. If the collection session is configured with an ID of `c13851b2-b1e1-438f-bf73-949df897f1bf` and a scratch path of  `C:\Users\Bob\AppData\Local\Temp\Microsoft\F12\perftools\visualprofiler\`, the following events occur when calling the `GetCurrentResult` method of the `ICollectionSession` object:

1. An Event Trace Log (.etl) file is created in the scratch path: `C:\Users\Bob\AppData\Local\Temp\Microsoft\F12\perftools\visualprofiler\c13851b2-b1e1-438f-bf73-949df897f1bf.1.m.etl`
2. A Report folder is also created in the scratch path: `C:\Users\Bob\AppData\Local\Temp\Microsoft\F12\perftools\visualprofiler\Report.c13851b2-b1e1-438f-bf73-949df897f1bf.1`
3. A folder with a random GUID is created in the report folder: `C:\Users\Bob\AppData\Local\Temp\Microsoft\F12\perftools\visualprofiler\Report.c13851b2-b1e1-438f-bf73-949df897f1bf.1\EAD6A227-31D4-4EA2-94A9-5DF276F69E65`

These folders and ETL files are created by the collector service for the .diagsession package that is normally created when a session has ended. Calling the `Stop` method on the `ICollectionSession` object will cause the collector service to commit the diagnostics package by calling `Microsoft::DiagnosticsHub::Packaging::DhPackageDirectory::CommitPackage`. The `CommitPackage` function will copy or move the original `{scratch path}\c13851b2-b1e1-438f-bf73-949df897f1bf.1.m.etl` file to the random GUID folder: `{scratch path}\Report.c13851b2-b1e1-438f-bf73-949df897f1bf.1\EAD6A227-31D4-4EA2-94A9-5DF276F69E65\c13851b2-b1e1-438f-bf73-949df897f1bf.1.m.etl`

The copy/move operation triggered by the `CommitPackagingResult` function in `DiagnosticsHub.StandardCollector.Runtime.dll`, is performed without impersonating the user (unlike the initial file/folder creation), leading to a possible TOCTOU issue if the target folder is replaced with a mount point that redirects the copy to an arbitrary location. To exploit this issue in a useful way, an attacker would need to swap the contents of the ETL file before it is copied. This can be done by beating the race condition with an OpLock after the file handle has been released by the service.

Although we don't fully control the name of the .etl file that is copied, we can use the object directory symlink trick to control it. The mount point+symlink setup would look something like this:

* Mount point: `{scratch path}\Report.c13851b2-b1e1-438f-bf73-949df897f1bf.1\EAD6A227-31D4-4EA2-94A9-5DF276F69E65\` -> `\RPC Control\`
* Symlink: `\RPC Control\c13851b2-b1e1-438f-bf73-949df897f1bf.1.m.etl` -> `C:\Windows\System32\anything.dll`

Having control of the file contents, copy location, and file name gives an attacker numerous DLL loading possibilities. However, the included PoC demonstrates how control of the filename is not needed since the collector service happily load a DLL with any filename, as long as it is in `C:\Windows\System32` or `C:\Windows\System32\DiagSvcs` directory. This is done by starting a new collector session with an agent that has an assembly name matching the name of the copied DLL `c13851b2-b1e1-438f-bf73-949df897f1bf.1.m.etl`.

The included PoC is a VS solution with a C++ DLL project for the notepad.exe popping payload and a C# project to interact with the service and exploit the vulnerability with the NtApiDotNet library.

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. Build Visual Studio Solution
2. Execute SystemCollector.exe as a normal user

**Expected Result:**

The package commit operation impersonates the user and fails when trying to copy the file.

**Observed Result:**

The file is copied to the mount point target folder `C:\Windows\System32`, then loaded as a collector agent, and finally, notepad.exe is spawned as SYSTEM privileges.

If the collection session is configured with an ID of c13851b2-b1e1-438f-bf73-949df897f1bf and a scratch path of C:\Users\Bob\AppData\Local\Temp\Microsoft\F12\perftools\visualprofiler\, the following events occur when calling the GetCurrentResult method of the ICollectionSession object:

An Event Trace Log (.etl) file is created in the scratch path: C:\Users\Bob\AppData\Local\Temp\Microsoft\F12\perftools\visualprofiler\c13851b2-b1e1-438f-bf73-949df897f1bf.1.m.etl
A Report folder is also created in the scratch path: C:\Users\Bob\AppData\Local\Temp\Microsoft\F12\perftools\visualprofiler\Report.c13851b2-b1e1-438f-bf73-949df897f1bf.1
A folder with a random GUID is created in the report folder: C:\Users\Bob\AppData\Local\Temp\Microsoft\F12\perftools\visualprofiler\Report.c13851b2-b1e1-438f-bf73-949df897f1bf.1\EAD6A227-31D4-4EA2-94A9-5DF276F69E65
These folders and ETL files are created by the collector service for the .diagsession package that is normally created when a session has ended. Calling the Stop method on the ICollectionSession object will cause the collector service to commit the diagnostics package by calling Microsoft::DiagnosticsHub::Packaging::DhPackageDirectory::CommitPackage. The CommitPackage function will copy or move the original {scratch path}\c13851b2-b1e1-438f-bf73-949df897f1bf.1.m.etl file to the random GUID folder: {scratch path}\Report.c13851b2-b1e1-438f-bf73-949df897f1bf.1\EAD6A227-31D4-4EA2-94A9-5DF276F69E65\c13851b2-b1e1-438f-bf73-949df897f1bf.1.m.etl

The copy/move operation triggered by the CommitPackagingResult function in DiagnosticsHub.StandardCollector.Runtime.dll, is performed without impersonating the user (unlike the initial file/folder creation), leading to a possible TOCTOU issue if the target folder is replaced with a mount point that redirects the copy to an arbitrary location. To exploit this issue in a useful way, an attacker would need to swap the contents of the ETL file before it is copied. This can be done by beating the race condition with an OpLock after the file handle has been released by the service.

Although we don't fully control the name of the .etl file that is copied, we can use the object directory symlink trick to control it. The mount point+symlink setup would look something like this:

Mount point: {scratch path}\Report.c13851b2-b1e1-438f-bf73-949df897f1bf.1\EAD6A227-31D4-4EA2-94A9-5DF276F69E65\ -> \RPC Control\
Symlink: \RPC Control\c13851b2-b1e1-438f-bf73-949df897f1bf.1.m.etl -> C:\Windows\System32\anything.dll
Having control of the file contents, copy location, and file name gives an attacker numerous DLL loading possibilities. However, the included PoC demonstrates how control of the filename is not needed since the collector service happily load a DLL with any filename, as long as it is in C:\Windows\System32 or C:\Windows\System32\DiagSvcs directory. This is done by starting a new collector session with an agent that has an assembly name matching the name of the copied DLL c13851b2-b1e1-438f-bf73-949df897f1bf.1.m.etl.

The included PoC is a VS solution with a C++ DLL project for the notepad.exe popping payload and a C# project to interact with the service and exploit the vulnerability with the NtApiDotNet library.

Steps to reproduce:

Build Visual Studio Solution
Execute SystemCollector.exe as a normal user
Expected Result:

The package commit operation impersonates the user and fails when trying to copy the file.

Observed Result:

The file is copied to the mount point target folder C:\Windows\System32, then loaded as a collector agent, and finally, notepad.exe is spawned as SYSTEM privileges.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# CVE-2018-0952: Privilege Escalation Vulnerability in Windows Standard Collector Service

Aug 21

Written By [Ryan Hanson](/blog?author=5ae89ee9a4f002409e2343a9)

If you aren't interested in the adventure behind this bug hunt, [ATREDIS-2018-0004](https://github.com/atredispartners/advisories/blob/master/ATREDIS-2018-0004.md) is a good TL;DR and here is the [Proof-of-Concept](https://github.com/atredispartners/CVE-2018-0952-SystemCollector).

[Process Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) has become a favorite tool of mine for both research and development. During development of offensive security tools, I frequently use it to monitor how the tools interact with Windows and how they might be detected. Earlier this year I noticed some interesting behavior while I was debugging some code in Visual Studio and monitoring with Procmon. Normally I setup exclusion filters for Visual Studio processes to reduce the noise, but prior to setting up the filters I notice a SYSTEM process writing to a user owned directory:

StandardCollector.Service.exe writing to user Temp folder

When a privileged service writes to a user owned resource, it opens up the possibility of symlink attack vector, as previously shown in the [Cylance privilege escalation](https://www.atredis.com/blog/cylance-privilege-escalation-vulnerability) bug I found. With the goal of identifying how I can directly influence the service's behavior, I began my research into the Standard Collector Service by reviewing the service's loaded libraries:

Visual Studio DLLs loaded by StandardCollector.Service.exe

The library paths indicated the Standard Collector Service was a part of Visual Studio's diagnostics tools. After reviewing the libraries and executables in the related folders, I identified several of the binaries were written in .NET, including a standalone CLI tool named VSDiagnostics.exe, here is the console output:

Help output from VSDiagnostics CLI tool

Loading VSDiagnostics into [dnSpy](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy) revealed a lot about the tool as well as how it interacts with the Standard Collector Service. First, an instance of `IStandardCollectorService` is acquired and a session configuration is used to create an `ICollectionSession`:

Initial steps for configuring diagnostics collection session

Next, agents are added to the `ICollectionSession` with a CLSID and DLL name, which also stood out as an interesting user controlled behavior. It also made me remember [previous research](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-16-372/) that [exploited](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=887) this exact behavior DLL loading behavior. At this point, it looked like the Visual Studio Standard Collector Service was very similar or the same as the Diagnostics Hub Standard Collector Service included with Windows 10. I began investigating this assumption by using [OleViewDotNet](https://github.com/tyranid/oleviewdotnet) to query the services for their supported interfaces:

Windows Diagnostics Hub Standard Collector Service in OleViewDotNet

Viewing the proxy definition of the `IStandardCollectorService` revealed other familiar interfaces, specifically the `ICollectionSession` interface seen in the VSDiagnostics source:

ICollectionSession interface definition in OleViewDotNet

Taking note of the Interface ID ("IID"), I returned to the .NET interop library to compare the IIDs and found that they were different:

Visual Studio ICollectionSession definition with different IID

Looking deeper into the .NET code, I found that these Visual Studio specific interfaces are loaded through the proxy DLLs:

VSDiagnostics.exe function to Load Proxy Stub DLLs

A quick review of the `ManualRegisterInterfaces` function in the `DiagnosticsHub.StandardCollector.Proxy.dll` showed a simple loop that iterates over an array of IIDs. Included in the array of IIDs is one belonging to the `ICollectionSession`:

Visual Studio ICollectionSession IID in array of IIDs to register

After I had a better understanding of the Visual Studio Collector service, I wanted to see if I could reuse the same .NET interop code to control the Windows Collector service. In order to interact with the correct service, I had to replace the Visual Studio CLSIDs and IIDs with the correct Windows Collector service CLSIDs and IIDs. Next, I used the modified code to build a client that simply created and started a diagnostics session with the collector service:

Code snippet of client used to interact with Collector service

Starting Procmon and running the client resulted in several files and folders being created in the specified `C:\Temp` scratch directory. Analyzing these events in Procmon showed that the initial directory creation was performed *with* client impersonation:

Session folder created in scratch directory with impersonation

Although the initial directory was created while impersonating the client, the subsequent files and folders were created *without* impersonation:

Folder created without impersonation

After taking a deeper look at the other file operations, there were several that stood out. The image below is an annotated break down of the various file operations performed by the Standard Collector Service:

Various file operations performed by Standard Collector Service

The most interesting behavior is the file copy operation that occurs during the diagnostics report creation. The image below shows the corresponding call stack and events of this behavior:

CopyFile operation performed by the Standard Collector Service

Now that I've identified user influenced behaviors, I construct a possible arbitrary file creation exploit plan:

1. Obtain op-lock on merged ETL file (`{GUID}.1.m.etl`) as soon as service calls `CloseFile`
2. Find and convert report sub-folder as mount point to `C:\Windows\System32`
3. Replace contents of `{GUID}.1.m.etl` with malicious DLL
4. Release op-lock to allow ETL file to be copied through the mount point
5. Start new collection session with copied ETL as agent DLL, triggering elevated code execution

To write the exploit, I extended the client from earlier by leveraging [James Forshaw's NtApiDotNet C# library](https://github.com/google/sandbox-attacksurface-analysis-tools/tree/master/NtApiDotNet) to programmatically create the op-lock and mount point. The images below shows code snippet used to acquire the op-lock and the corresponding Procmon output illustrating the loop and op-lock acquisition:

Winning race condition with op-lock

Acquiring an op-lock on the file essentially stops the `CopyFile` race, allows the contents to be overwritten, and provides control of when the `CopyFile` occurs. Next, the exploit looks for the Report folder and scans it for the randomly named sub directory that needs to be converted to a mount point. Once the mount point is successfully created, the contents of the .etl are replaced with a malicious DLL. Finally, the .etl file is closed and the op-lock is released, allowing the `CopyFile` operation to continue. The code snippet and Procmon output for this step is shown in the images below:

Procmon output for arbitrary file write through mount point folder

There are several techniques for escalating privileges through an arbitrary file write, but for this exploit, I chose to use the Collector service's agent DLL loading capability to keep it isolated to a single service. You'll notice in the image above, I did not use the mount point + symlink trick to rename the file to a .dll because DLLs can be loaded with any extension. For the purpose of this exploit the DLL simply needed to be in the System32 folder for the Collector service to load it. The image below demonstrates successful execution of the exploit and the corresponding Procmon output:

Procmon output of successful exploitation

I know that the above screenshots show the exploit was run as the user "Admin", so here is a GIF showing it being ran as "bob", a low-privileged user account:

Running exploit as low-privileged user

Feel free to try out the [SystemCollector PoC](https://github.com/atredispartners/CVE-2018-0952-SystemCollector) yourself. Turning the PoC into a portable exploit for offensive security engagements is a task I'll leave to the reader. The `NtApiDotNet` library is also a PowerShell module, which should make things a bit easier.

After this bug was patched as part of the August 2018 Patch Tuesday, I began reversing the patch, which was relatively simple. As expected, the patch simply added `CoImpersonateClient` calls prior to the previously vulnerable file operations, specifically the `CommitPackagingResult` function in `DiagnosticsHub.StandardCollector.Runtime.dll`:

CoImpersonateClient added to CommitPackagingResult in DiagnosticsHub.StandardCollector.Runtime.dll

As previously mentioned in the [Cylance privilege escalation](https://www.atredis.com/blog/cylance-privilege-escalation-vulnerability) write-up, protecting against symlink attacks may seem easy, but is often times overlooked. Any time a privileged service is performing file operations on behalf of a user, proper impersonation is needed in order to prevent these types of attacks.

Upon finding this vulnerability, MSRC was contacted with the vulnerability details and PoC. MSRC quickly triaged and validated the finding and provided regular updates throughout the remediation process. The full disclosure timeline can be found in the Atredis advisory link below.

## Technical Details

The Standard Collector Service allows for a several values to be defined when configuring a diagnostics session, including the scratch directory and session ID. The session ID can be any GUID and the scratch directory can be any location the user has write permissions too. If the collection session is configured with an ID of `c13851b2-b1e1-438f-bf73-949df897f1bf` and a scratch path of  `C:\Users\Bob\AppData\Local\Temp\Microsoft\F12\perftools\visualprofiler\`, the following events occur when calling the `GetCurrentResult` method of the `ICollectionSession` object:

1. An Event Trace Log (.etl) file is created in the scratch path: `C:\Users\Bob\AppData\Local\Temp\Microsoft\F12\perftools\visualprofiler\c13851b2-b1e1-438f-bf73-949df897f1bf.1.m.etl`
2. A Report folder is also created in the scratch path: `C:\Users\Bob\AppData\Local\Temp\Microsoft\F12\perftools\visualprofiler\Report.c13851b2-b1e1-438f-bf73-949df897f1bf.1`
3. A folder with a random GUID is created in the report folder: `C:\Users\Bob\AppData\Local\Temp\Microsoft\F12\perftools\visualprofiler\Report.c13851b2-b1e1-438f-bf73-949df897f1bf.1\EAD6A227-31D4-4EA2-94A9-5DF276F69E65`

These folders and ETL files are created by the collector service for the .diagsession package that is normally created when a session has ended. Calling the `Stop` method on the `ICollectionSession` object will cause the collector service to commit the diagnostics package by calling `Microsoft::DiagnosticsHub::Packaging::DhPackageDirectory::CommitPackage`. The `CommitPackage` function will copy or move the original `{scratch path}\c13851b2-b1e1-438f-bf73-949df897f1bf.1.m.etl` file to the random GUID folder: `{scratch path}\Report.c13851b2-b1e1-438f-bf73-949df897f1bf.1\EAD6A227-31D4-4EA2-94A9-5DF276F69E65\c13851b2-b1e1-438f-bf73-949df897f1bf.1.m.etl`

The copy/move operation triggered by the `CommitPackagingResult` function in `DiagnosticsHub.StandardCollector.Runtime.dll`, is performed without impersonating the user (unlike the initial file/folder creation), leading to a possible TOCTOU issue if the target folder is replaced with a mount point that redirects the copy to an arbitrary location. To exploit this issue in a useful way, an attacker would need to swap the contents of the ETL file before it is copied. This can be done by beating the race condition with an OpLock after the file handle has been released by the service.

Although we don't fully control the name of the .etl file that is copied, we can use the object directory symlink trick to control it. The mount point+symlink setup would look something like this:

* Mount point: `{scratch path}\Report.c13851b2-b1e1-438f-bf73-949df897f1bf.1\EAD6A227-31D4-4EA2-94A9-5DF276F69E65\` -> `\RPC Control\`
* Symlink: `\RPC Control\c13851b2-b1e1-438f-bf73-949df897f1bf.1.m.etl` -> `C:\Windows\System32\anything.dll`

Having control of the file contents, copy location, and file name gives an attacker numerous DLL loading possibilities. However, the referenced PoC demonstrates how control of the filename is not needed since the collector service will happily load a DLL with any filename, as long as it is in the `C:\Windows\System32` or `C:\Windows\System32\DiagSvcs` directory. This is done by starting a new collector session with an agent that has an assembly name matching the name of the copied DLL `c13851b2-b1e1-438f-bf73-949df897f1bf.1.m.etl`.
