Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0130:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the presence of static default credentials within the web-based service portal of Cisco Elastic Services Controller Software. These credentials are used to generate JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The primary weakness is the use of static, default credentials in the software's image.
*   **JWT Generation:** The application uses these default credentials to generate administrative session tokens (JWT), which means anyone who extracts the credentials can generate their own valid tokens.
*   **Lack of Credential Rotation:** It can be inferred that there is no mechanism in place to force the changing of these default credentials after the initial software setup/deployment.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Administrative Access:** A successful exploit allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain administrative access to the web-based service portal. This could grant complete control of the affected system.
*  The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 (High), indicating a significant risk.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely without requiring any prior authentication.
*   **Credential Extraction:** Attackers must first extract the static credentials from an image of the vulnerable software. This implies that the attacker must have access to the software image itself or a running instance using the vulnerable image.
*   **Token Generation:** Once the credentials are extracted, the attacker can use them to generate a valid administrative session token.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Software Image:** The attacker needs to obtain a copy of the Cisco Elastic Services Controller Software image or access to a running system based on a vulnerable version of the image.
*   **Credential Extraction Skill:** The attacker must be able to extract the default credentials from the software image.
*   **Remote Network Connectivity:**  The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable instance of Cisco Elastic Services Controller to use the generated token.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Cisco Elastic Services Controller Software Release 3.0.0.
*   Releases prior to 3.0.0 and other Cisco products are not affected by this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Elastic Services Controller Software Releases 3.1.0 and later.
*   There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability other than upgrading the software.
*   Cisco states the vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing and that there is no evidence of public announcements or malicious use.

This analysis provides more detail than the official CVE description by outlining the technical details of the vulnerability, including the use of JWTs, and the steps an attacker would need to take to exploit the flaw.
