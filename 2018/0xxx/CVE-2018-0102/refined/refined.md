Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-0102:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a double free error within the Pong tool of Cisco NX-OS Software. The software attempts to free the same memory area twice.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Double free vulnerability in the Pong tool.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by causing an affected device to reload.
- In a dual or quad supervisor virtual port-channel (vPC) environment, exploitation could cause a reload of the vPC.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted pong request to an affected device.
- The attack must originate from a network location that causes the pong reply to egress both a FabricPath and a non-FabricPath port.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be located on the adjacent network.
- The attacker must be able to send pong requests to the targeted device.
- The following conditions must be met on the targeted device for the vulnerability to be exploitable:
    - The Pong tool must be enabled (disabled by default).
    - The FabricPath feature must be enabled (disabled by default).
    - A FabricPath port must be actively monitored via a SPAN (Switched Port Analyzer) session (not configured or enabled by default).

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in Cisco NX-OS Software Releases 7.2(1)D(1), 7.2(2)D1(1), and 7.2(2)D1(2).
- Exploitation of the vulnerability will generate a pong core file.
- There are no workarounds to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Cisco NX-OS Software Releases 7.3(0)D1(1) and later.
- The CVSS v3 base score for this vulnerability is 7.4 (High).
- The vector string is CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H.
