Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-0096

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the failure to properly enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for virtual domains within Cisco Prime Infrastructure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Improper RBAC enforcement: The system does not correctly restrict access based on defined user roles and virtual domain configurations.
*   Privilege Escalation: An authenticated user in one virtual domain can gain unauthorized access to view and modify the configurations of other virtual domains.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Unauthorized access: Attackers can bypass RBAC policies.
*   Data modification: Attackers can modify virtual domain configurations they should not have access to.
*   Confidentiality Breach: Attackers can view configurations of other virtual domains.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Network-based: The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the targeted application via the network.
*   Remote: The attacker does not need physical access to the affected system.
*   Authentication Required: Attackers need to be authenticated as a user with access to one of the virtual domains.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Authenticated user: The attacker needs valid credentials for Cisco Prime Infrastructure.
*   Network access: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable system.
*   High privilege (PR:H) required

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
*   No workarounds are available.
*   The issue is addressed in software updates released by Cisco.
*   The vulnerability is specific to Cisco Prime Infrastructure.
*   No public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability have been reported.
