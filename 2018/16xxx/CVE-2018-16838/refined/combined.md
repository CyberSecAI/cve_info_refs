RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1638295#c0)  Ondrej    2018-10-11 09:42:01 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  "sssctl user-checks" also query the IFP interface of sssd. The problem is, that this command only displays POSIX user attrs, no matter if we configured the InfoPipe for additional user attributes.  for example, if I have the following configuration snippet: [ifp]     	debug_level = 9 	allowed_uids = ondrejv, root 	user_attributes = +mail, +telephoneNumber, +givenname, +sn  I would expect the "sssctl user-checks" command will - also return the value of "mail, telephoneNumber, givenname, sn" attributes - ideally, we could make the "sssctl user-checks" also available for non-root users (ondrejv in the example above), but I guess I am asking too much :-)  I know I could get the results with dbus-send or the Python dbus module, but parsing the output of sssctl is better parseable for a simple bash script.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1638295#c2)  Jakub Hrozek    2018-10-12 07:22:30 UTC  ``` Initial triage notes:  - the IFP interface seems to publish the list of the extra attributes, so the sssctl tool might read them this way and display the attributes. This should be doable for both 1.16 and 2.0   - using non-root is a separate issue though. While we /should/ make it possible for every user to display info about 'self', this would probably mean we need to finish the polkit integration. It is also not very likely that this work will be backportable to 1.16 as only the D-Bus changes Pavel did in 2.0 allow us for the right level of granularity.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1638295#c3)  Jakub Hrozek    2018-10-25 11:39:42 UTC  ``` Upstream ticket: <https://pagure.io/SSSD/sssd/issue/3866>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1638295#c4)  Jakub Hrozek    2019-02-05 21:17:28 UTC  ``` * master: ee9fdb08f73571683b272f06b6ea25630a2dbe01   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1638295#c7)  Madhuri    2019-09-10 07:00:05 UTC  ``` Verified with: # rpm -qa sssd sssd-2.2.0-18.el8.x86_64  Verifications steps: 1) Setup sssd client 2) Update sssd.conf   # cat /etc/sssd/sssd.conf  [sssd] config_file_version = 2 services = nss, pam domains = example1  [domain/example1] debug_level = 9 use_fully_qualified_names = True ldap_user_home_directory = /home/%u ldap_uri = ldaps://ipaqavmh.idmqe.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com ldap_search_base = dc=example,dc=test id_provider = ldap auth_provider = ldap ldap_tls_cacert = /etc/openldap/cacerts/cacert.pem  [ifp] debug_level = 9 allowed_uids = root, foo1@example1 user_attributes = +mail, +telephoneNumber, +givenname, +sn  Case 1:  Test with allowed_uids = root and foo1@example1  [ifp] debug_level = 9 allowed_uids = root, madhuri user_attributes = +mail, +telephoneNumber, +givenname, +sn   [root@vm-idm-018 ~]# sssctl user-checks foo1@example1 user: foo1@example1 action: acct service: system-auth  SSSD nss user lookup result:  - user name: foo1@example1  - user id: 14583101  - group id: 14564100  - gecos: foo1 User  - home directory:   - shell: /bin/bash  SSSD InfoPipe user lookup result:  - name: foo1@example1  - uidNumber: 14583101  - gidNumber: 14564100  - gecos: foo1 User  - homeDirectory: not set  - loginShell: /bin/bash  - mail: foo1  testing pam_acct_mgmt  pam_acct_mgmt: Success  PAM Environment:  - no env -  case 2:  Test with allowed_uids = 0 and ldapuser's uid   [ifp] debug_level = 9 allowed_uids = 0, 14583101 user_attributes = +mail, +telephoneNumber, +givenname, +sn   # sssctl user-checks foo1@example1 user: foo1@example1 action: acct service: system-auth  SSSD nss user lookup result:  - user name: foo1@example1  - user id: 14583101  - group id: 14564100  - gecos: foo1 User  - home directory:   - shell: /bin/bash  SSSD InfoPipe user lookup result:  - name: foo1@example1  - uidNumber: 14583101  - gidNumber: 14564100  - gecos: foo1 User  - homeDirectory: not set  - loginShell: /bin/bash  - mail: foo1  testing pam_acct_mgmt  pam_acct_mgmt: Success  PAM Environment:  - no env -  case 3:  Test with allowed_uids = root and localuser  [ifp] debug_level = 9 allowed_uids = root, madhuri user_attributes = +mail, +telephoneNumber, +givenname, +sn   [root@vm-idm-018 ~]# sssctl user-checks madhuri user: madhuri action: acct service: system-auth  SSSD nss user lookup result:  - user name: madhuri  - user id: 1001  - group id: 1001  - gecos:   - home directory: /home/madhuri  - shell: /bin/bash  SSSD InfoPipe user lookup result:  - name: madhuri  - uidNumber: 1001  - gidNumber: 1001  - gecos: not set  - homeDirectory: /home/madhuri  - loginShell: /bin/bash  testing pam_acct_mgmt  pam_acct_mgmt: Success  PAM Environment:  - no env -  case 4:  Test with allowed_uids = 0 and localuser's uid  [ifp] debug_level = 9 allowed_uids = 0, 1001 user_attributes = +mail, +telephoneNumber, +givenname, +sn  [root@vm-idm-018 ~]# sssctl user-checks madhuri user: madhuri action: acct service: system-auth  SSSD nss user lookup result:  - user name: madhuri  - user id: 1001  - group id: 1001  - gecos:   - home directory: /home/madhuri  - shell: /bin/bash  SSSD InfoPipe user lookup result:  - name: madhuri  - uidNumber: 1001  - gidNumber: 1001  - gecos: not set  - homeDirectory: /home/madhuri  - loginShell: /bin/bash  testing pam_acct_mgmt  pam_acct_mgmt: Success  PAM Environment:  - no env -   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1638295#c8)  Madhuri    2019-09-10 12:38:01 UTC  ``` By mistake I copied wrong sssd.conf  Here is correct sssd.conf  [root@vm-idm-018 ~]# cat /etc/sssd/sssd.conf  [sssd] config_file_version = 2 services = nss, pam, ifp domains = example1  [domain/example1] debug_level = 9 use_fully_qualified_names = True ldap_user_home_directory = /home/%u ldap_uri = ldaps://ipaqavmh.idmqe.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com ldap_search_base = dc=example,dc=test id_provider = ldap auth_provider = ldap ldap_tls_cacert = /etc/openldap/cacerts/cacert.pem  [ifp] debug_level = 9 allowed_uids = 0, 1001 user_attributes = +mail, +telephoneNumber, +givenname, +sn   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1638295#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-11-05 22:33:53 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Package        : sssd
Version        : 1.16.3-3.2+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-16838 CVE-2019-3811 CVE-2021-3621 CVE-2022-4254
Debian Bug     : 919051 931432 992710

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in sssd, a set of daemons to manage
access to remote directories and authentication mechanisms, which could
lead to privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-16838

    It was discovered that when the Group Policy Objects (GPO) are not
    readable by SSSD due to a too strict permission settings on the
    server side, SSSD allows all authenticated users to login instead of
    denying access.

    A new boolean setting ‘ad_gpo_ignore_unreadable’ (defaulting to
    False) is introduced for environments where attributes in the
    groupPolicyContainer are not readable and changing the permissions
    on the GPO objects is not possible or desirable.  See sssd-ad(5).

CVE-2019-3811

    It was discovered that if a user was configured with no home
    directory set, then sssd(8) returns ‘/’ (i.e., the root directory)
    instead of the empty string (meaning no home directory).  This could
    impact services that restrict the user's filesystem access to within
    their home directory through chroot() or similar.

CVE-2021-3621

    It was discovered that the sssctl(8) command was vulnerable to shell
    command injection via the ‘logs-fetch’ and ‘cache-expire’
    subcommands.

    This flaw could allows an attacker to trick the root user into
    running a specially crafted sssctl(8) command, such as via sudo, in
    order to gain root privileges.

CVE-2022-4254

    It was discovered that libsss_certmap failed to sanitize certificate
    data used in LDAP filters.

    PKINIT enables a client to authenticate to the KDC using an X.509
    certificate and the corresponding private key, rather than a
    passphrase or keytab.  Mapping rules are used in order to map the
    certificate presented during a PKINIT authentication request to the
    corresponding principal.  However the mapping filter was found to be
    vulnerable to LDAP filter injection.  As the search result is be
    influenced by values in the certificate, which may be attacker
    controlled, this flaw could allow an attacker to gain control of the
    admin account, leading to full domain takeover.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1.16.3-3.2+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your sssd packages.

its security tracker page at:

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2019%3A2177)

## Topic

An update for sssd is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) service provides a set of daemons to manage access to remote directories and authentication mechanisms. It also provides the Name Service Switch (NSS) and the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) interfaces toward the system, and a pluggable back-end system to connect to multiple different account sources.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: sssd (1.16.4). (BZ#1658994)

Security Fix(es):

* sssd: fallback\_homedir returns '/' for empty home directories in passwd file (CVE-2019-3811)
* sssd: improper implementation of GPOs due to too restrictive permissions (CVE-2018-16838)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Additional Changes:

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1658366#c0)  Laura Pardo    2018-12-11 21:05:40 UTC  ``` An issue was found in rsyslog. When imtcp module and Octet-Counted TCP Framing ("on" by default) are enabled, Rsyslog can be crashed remotely when sending an crafted (improperly formatted) message to "imptcp" listening socket.   Upstream Patch: <https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/commit/0381a0de64a5a048c3d48b79055bd9848d0c7fc2>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1658366#c4)  Doran Moppert    2018-12-14 04:09:22 UTC  ``` This vulnerability appears to have been introduced in upstream commit 6c52f29d59, which was first included in release 8.13.1.  > optimized payload-copy in processDataRcvd for octate-counted frames (as length is pre-known, it is possible to avoid coping char by char, as opposed to octate-stuffed frames).   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1658366#c7)  Laura Pardo    2018-12-18 19:37:06 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Joel Miller (Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1658366#c8)  Doran Moppert    2018-12-19 03:31:51 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  This vulnerability requires the "imptcp" module to be enabled, and listening on a port that can potentially be reached by attackers. This module is not enabled by default in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. To check if imptcp is enabled, look for the string `$InputPTCPServerRun`in your rsyslog configuration.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1658366#c12)  Mark D. Foster    2019-02-05 23:17:36 UTC  ``` shouldn't it say imtcp (instead of imptcp)?   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1658366#c13)  Jiří Vymazal    2019-02-06 08:16:33 UTC  ``` (In reply to Mark D. Foster from [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=1658366#c12)) > shouldn't it say imtcp (instead of imptcp)?  No, there are two separate rsyslog plugins, imtcp adn imptcp (sort of simplified version), this bug concerns the latter one.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1658366#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-06 12:15:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2019:2110 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2110](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2110)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1658366#c15)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-08-06 13:20:58 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-16881>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1658366#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-12 11:54:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Virtualization 4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2019:2437 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2437](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2437)   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1658366#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-12 11:54:38 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Virtualization 4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2019:2439 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2439](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2439)   ```   [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1658366#c19)  williamanderson    2023-10-05 09:06:51 UTC  Comment hidden (spam)  ``` The <https://www.myexamcollection.com/312-50v12-vce-questions.htm> is one of the most difficult and important exams in the cyber security industry.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

Consequently, Samba denied access to files in certain cases, even if the user or group existed and it was known by SSSD. The problem has been fixed. As a result, Samba no longer denies access when using the `sss` plug-in. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Clones: | [1707759](show_bug.cgi?id=1707759 "CLOSED ERRATA - Error accessing files on samba share randomly")  ([view as bug list](buglist.cgi?bug_id=1707759)) | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2019-11-05 22:33:53 UTC | | | Type: | Bug | | | Target Upstream Version: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | | [Dependent Products:](page.cgi?id=fields.html#dependent_products "Other Products that are affected by this bug.") | Container Native Virtualization (CNV) Ember-CSI ExternalDNS Operator for OpenShift Container Platform Kubernetes-native Infrastructure OpenShift Container Platform Red Hat Ceph Storage Red Hat Certificate System Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine Red Hat Directory Server Red Hat Enterprise MRG Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager Red Hat Gluster Storage Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation Red Hat OpenStack Service Telemetry Framework | |

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1645461#c0)  afox@redhat.com    2018-11-02 09:46:55 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Following upgrade to sssd-client-1.16.2-13, users are no longer able to login to their workstations following system reboot. sssd must be manually restarted, and then login works.   This is causing major disruption for my customer, as they have several hundred workstation users who are now experiencing login problems.   Downgrading to sssd-1.16.0-19 resolves the issue.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): sssd-1.16.2-13  How reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install sssd-1.16.2-13 2. Reboot system. 3. Users are unable to login.

So initialization is completed > (Mon Nov 12 11:02:40 2018) [sssd[be[...]]] [main] (0x0400): Backend provider (...) started! and tevent main loop entered only at 11:02:40 Before that internal dbus "OK ..." response to "AUTH EXTERNAL" request sent from Monitor sbus server is not even read and dbus handshake is not completed and "Sending ID: " (despite how it looks in the log) is *not* actually sent.   Now, Monitor allows exactly 10 seconds for service to start: >     /* 10 seconds should be plenty */ >    tv = tevent_timeval_current_ofs(10, 0); >    mini->timeout = tevent_add_timer(ctx->ev, mini, tv, init_timeout, mini); and service was started at 11:02:29: > (Mon Nov 12 11:02:29 2018) [sssd] [start_service] (0x0100): Queueing service ... for startup  So I guess Monitor handles timeout and closes connection ~ in the same moment as provider is almost ready to proceed.  This is somewhat similar to [BZ 1666819](show_bug.cgi?id=1666819) but different flavor.   Btw, I do not uderstand why Monitor allows every service (including providers) 10 seconds to start, but starts responders earlier: > (Mon Nov 12 11:02:34 2018) [sssd] [services_startup_timeout] (0x0020): Providers did not start in time, forcing services startup!   So: (1) What is `ad` module doing at construction? (If I am correct in spotting "hang point") Does `ad` module have anything to do with `winbindd` (as in [BZ 1666819](show_bug.cgi?id=1666819))? (2) How is this problem related with sssd upgrade? (3) Would it make sense to synchronize two Monitor timeouts (to prevent case when responder connects to starting provider)?

Install the old SSSD build : sssd-1.16.0-19.el7.x86_64 in RHEL-7.7 system.   2. Add 100s of users & groups in ldap server and enumerate them into SSSD client to ensure a large cache size.  # ls -lh /var/lib/sss/db/ total 16.0M -rw-------. 1 root root 11.0M May 20 09:37 cache_LDAP.ldb -rw-------. 1 root root 1.3M May 20 09:27 config.ldb -rw-------. 1 root root 1.3M May 20 09:27 sssd.ldb -rw-------. 1 root root 3.6M May 20 09:32 timestamps_LDAP.ldb  3. Execute simultaneous user login by running a script in the background. This can be done from different terminals in such a way that atleast 50 different users attempt login within a span of 10 minutes.  OBSERVATION : With old build, all the user logins were successful and the duration for individual user login was in the range of 0.5 - 1.2 seconds.  4. Now, upgrade the SSSD build to latest version: sssd-1.16.4-13.el7.x86_64  5. Reboot the system.  6. Repeat step-3.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.
