{
  "CVE-2018-16838": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a flaw in sssd's Group Policy Objects (GPO) implementation. When the GPO is not readable by SSSD because of overly strict permissions on the server-side, SSSD incorrectly allows all authenticated users to login instead of denying access.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper implementation of GPOs leading to authentication bypass",
      "Failure to correctly deny access when GPO is unreadable",
      "Use of  insufficiently restrictive permissions."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could bypass intended access controls and gain access to systems, potentially leading to unauthorized access to resources and system compromise.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote unauthenticated attacker.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A remote unauthenticated attacker who can establish a network connection to the affected service, with knowledge of the vulnerability and the ability to modify network traffic. The attacker must also have the ability to authenticate to the system."
