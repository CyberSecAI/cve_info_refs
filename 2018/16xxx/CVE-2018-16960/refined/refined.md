Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-16960

**Vulnerable Product:** Open XDMoD

**Affected Versions:** Versions prior to 8.0

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `/html/gui/general/login.php` file. Specifically, the `xd_user_formal_name` parameter is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not properly sanitize the input provided for the `xd_user_formal_name` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful XSS attack could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to:
    - Stealing user session cookies, enabling account hijacking.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the web page.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the `xd_user_formal_name` parameter of the login form.
- When the affected login.php page is rendered by a user, the injected script executes within their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `xd_user_formal_name` parameter, likely through a login or registration form.
- No specific privileges are mentioned. The attacker could potentially be an unauthenticated or low-privileged user.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is related to CVE-2018-16988 and CVE-2018-16961
- The vulnerability was discovered in version 7.5 and is expected to be fixed in the 8.0 release.
