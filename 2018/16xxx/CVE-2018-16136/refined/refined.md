Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2018-16136:

**CVE-2018-16136: Lack of Anti-CSRF tokens in the whole administrative interface**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IPBrickOS administrative interface does not implement checks for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Lack of CSRF protection across the entire administrative interface, making all forms vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into unknowingly submitting unwanted forms, leading to actions like creating a new administrator account.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft malicious web pages or links that, when accessed by a logged-in administrator, trigger requests to the vulnerable application without the administrator's knowledge.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into accessing a malicious resource. They do not need to have direct access to the IPBrickOS server or administrative interface other than through the victim's browser.

The provided text also details other vulnerabilities that are not related to CVE-2018-16136, which are:
*   **Session Fixation:** A vulnerability in IPBrickOS where an expired session ID can be reused, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication if they obtain a session cookie. This is not related to CSRF.
*   **SQL Injection (CVE-2018-16137):**  Both authenticated and unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerabilities due to insufficient input validation, allowing for database access and potential privilege escalation. This is not related to CSRF.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CVE-2018-16138):** Widespread XSS vulnerabilities due to lack of input sanitization in the administrative interface, which could allow injection of JavaScript code and session token theft. This is not related to CSRF.
