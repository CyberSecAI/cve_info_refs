Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-16282

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is a command injection flaw in the web server functionality of the Moxa EDR-810 device. Specifically, the "caname" parameter in the `/xml/net_WebCADELETEGetValue` URI is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `caname` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands.
- **Lack of Authentication:** When accessing the vulnerable URI through `/xml/` instead of `/goform/`, no authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands on the target device.
- **Root Privilege:** The attacker gains root privileges, providing complete control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited using a simple HTTP GET request.
- **Vulnerable URI:** `/xml/net_WebCADELETEGetValue`
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** `caname`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable Moxa EDR-810 device.
- **No Authentication (for /xml/ URI):** No authentication is needed when the attack is made through the `/xml/` URI.
- **Basic HTTP knowledge:** Ability to craft and send HTTP GET requests.

**Technical Details:**
The attacker injects OS commands into the `caname` parameter by inserting a semicolon (`;`) to terminate the expected command and add their malicious command.

**Example Attack Payload:**

```
http://<IP>/xml/net_WebCADELETEGetValue?caname=";<OS COMMAND>;"
```

**Test Payload (to check for vulnerability):**
```
http://<IP>/xml/net_WebCADELETEGetValue?caname="; sleep 5 ;"
```
If the page takes 5 seconds to load, the device is likely vulnerable.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Moxa EDR-810 V4.2 build 18041013.
- The provided PoC demonstrates both authenticated and unauthenticated exploitation via `/goform/` and `/xml/` respectively. The more critical vulnerability is the unauthenticated one using `/xml/`
- The attacker can use this vulnerability to gain a reverse shell.
