{
  "CVE-2018-16841": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a double-free in Samba's KDC when configured to accept smart-card authentication (PKINIT). Specifically, if the principal in a validly signed certificate does not match the principal in the AS-REQ, the same memory is freed twice using `talloc_free()`.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Double-free"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote, authenticated attacker can cause a denial of service (application crash) by exploiting this double-free vulnerability.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker who can authenticate with a trusted certificate that does not match the principal in the AS-REQ can trigger the double-free.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a valid certificate that can authenticate with the Samba KDC, and the principal in this certificate must not match the principal in the AS-REQ."
