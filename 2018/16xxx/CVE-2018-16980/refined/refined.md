- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `fieldName` and `inode` parameters of the `/html/portlet/ext/contentlet/image_tools/index.jsp` endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when they visit the vulnerable URL. This can be used to steal cookies, session tokens, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL with a payload in the `fieldName` parameter, such as `fieldName=1%22%20%6f%6e%65%72%72%6f%72%3d%61%6c%65%72%74%28%27%31%27%29%20%3e`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to convince a victim to visit a maliciously crafted URL.
