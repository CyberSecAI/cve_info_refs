  "vulnerability": {
    "cve": "CVE-2018-16984",
    "details": "The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the Django web framework. Specifically, Django versions 2.1 before 2.1.2 have a flaw that, if exploited, could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. The weakness exists because admin users with view-only permissions to the user model were able to view the entire password hash, whereas users with change permissions only saw part of the hash.  This vulnerability is related to the exposure of password hashes in the Django admin interface, specifically for view-only users. While strong hashes are difficult to reverse, weaker hashing algorithms like MD5 or SHA1 would be vulnerable.\n\nThe impact of exploiting this vulnerability is the potential disclosure of sensitive information, particularly password hashes. A user with high privileges can get a high value information. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely and doesn't require user interaction. The attack requires that the attacker has high privileges to view admin interface.",
