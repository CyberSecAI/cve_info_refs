    "description": "A vulnerability was found in rsyslog. When imtcp module and Octet-Counted TCP Framing (\"on\" by default) are enabled, Rsyslog can be crashed remotely when sending a crafted (improperly formatted) message to \"imptcp\" listening socket. An integer overflow vulnerability exists in rsyslog's imptcp module when Octet-Counted TCP Framing is enabled. A remote attacker can send a specially crafted message to the imptcp socket, which would cause rsyslog to crash.",

      "Integer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service, potentially arbitrary code execution (according to Debian LTS advisory)",
    "attack_vector": "Remote",
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker can send a specially crafted (improperly formatted) message to the imptcp socket of a vulnerable rsyslog server."
    ,
     "details": "The vulnerability is triggered in the processDataRcvd function when octet-counted framing is used. This vulnerability was introduced in upstream commit 6c52f29d59, which was first included in release 8.13.1 of rsyslog. The \"imptcp\" module must be enabled and listening on a reachable port. This module is not enabled by default in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. The issue arises when a specially crafted message with an improper format is sent to the imptcp listening socket, causing an integer overflow which leads to a crash.  Specifically, a crafted message with an invalid length can cause a buffer overflow. Red Hat states that the imptcp module is not enabled by default, and recommends looking for the string `$InputPTCPServerRun` in the rsyslog configuration to determine if it is in use."

  "CVE-2019-1559": {
    "description": "A vulnerability was found in OpenSSL 1.0.2. When an application encounters a fatal protocol error and then calls SSL_shutdown() twice, OpenSSL can respond differently to the calling application if a 0 byte record is received with invalid padding compared to if a 0 byte record is received with an invalid MAC. This difference in behaviour can be detected by a remote peer, then this amounts to a padding oracle that could be used to decrypt data. In order for this to be exploitable 'non-stitched' ciphersuites must be in use. Also the application must call SSL_shutdown() twice even if a protocol error has occurred (applications should not do this but some do anyway). AEAD ciphersuites are not impacted. This issue does not impact OpenSSL 1.1.1 or 1.1.0.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Padding Oracle"
    ],
    "impact": "Information disclosure due to the possibility of decrypting data",
    "attack_vector": "Remote",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker must be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and modify requests sent by the browser. Also, the application must call SSL_shutdown() twice, even after a protocol error. The attacker must also be able to control the client side to send requests to a vulnerable server. The target has to use an obsolete CBC cipher without a stitched implementation. AES-NI must not be used.",
      "details": "The vulnerability can be triggered when an application using the OpenSSL library calls `SSL_shutdown()` twice, even after a protocol error. A remote attacker can send a 0-byte record with invalid padding, which causes a different response than when a 0-byte record with an invalid MAC is sent, leading to a padding oracle. This allows for data decryption. It only affects non-stitched ciphersuites. It is mitigated when the code is compiled with FORTIFY protections."
