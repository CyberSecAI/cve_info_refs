| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1658366#c0)  Laura Pardo    2018-12-11 21:05:40 UTC  ``` An issue was found in rsyslog. When imtcp module and Octet-Counted TCP Framing ("on" by default) are enabled, Rsyslog can be crashed remotely when sending an crafted (improperly formatted) message to "imptcp" listening socket.   Upstream Patch: <https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/commit/0381a0de64a5a048c3d48b79055bd9848d0c7fc2>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1658366#c4)  Doran Moppert    2018-12-14 04:09:22 UTC  ``` This vulnerability appears to have been introduced in upstream commit 6c52f29d59, which was first included in release 8.13.1.  > optimized payload-copy in processDataRcvd for octate-counted frames (as length is pre-known, it is possible to avoid coping char by char, as opposed to octate-stuffed frames).   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1658366#c7)  Laura Pardo    2018-12-18 19:37:06 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Joel Miller (Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1658366#c8)  Doran Moppert    2018-12-19 03:31:51 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  This vulnerability requires the "imptcp" module to be enabled, and listening on a port that can potentially be reached by attackers. This module is not enabled by default in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. To check if imptcp is enabled, look for the string `$InputPTCPServerRun`in your rsyslog configuration.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1658366#c12)  Mark D.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

The configuration loads the imfile module and reads logfiles below /var/log/containers/*.log via inotify.  If the number of files below /var/log/containers exceeds around 30 Files rsyslog is not able to start up und throws a buffer overflow exception.  The Logfiles below /var/log/containers/*.log are symlinks to the actual logfiles. See Actual Results for Stacktrace.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): rsyslog-8.24.0-34.el7.x86_64   How reproducible: Could not reproduce on a system without workload. Still trying.   Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.

overflow.   Additional info: There is a similiar issue on rsyslogs github. <https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/133>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1656860#c2)  Sven    2018-12-06 14:10:23 UTC  ``` Supplement: This error only occured on our systems after upgrading to 7.6 which upgraded rsyslog from version 8.24.0-16 to rsyslog-8.24.0-34   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1656860#c3)  Jiří Vymazal    2018-12-10 14:55:33 UTC  ``` Hi Sven,  Any updated regarding a reproducer? I tried few things but I was unable to reproduce the issue. Are you able to try if rsyslog crashes when the log files are created while rsyslog is running or only when started with the files already in place? Also, when rsyslog is restarted after the crash does it crash again? If not does the collecting of logs from files work as expected?  Thanks for answers.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1656860#c4)  Sven    2018-12-21 15:56:54 UTC  ``` Hi Jiří,  sorry for the delay. It took me a while to find a case where I could reproduce the problem reliably.  I created a vagrant machine so you could easily follow the problem: <https://github.com/svenbs/centos7-rsyslogd-bufferoverflow-reproduction>  Regards, Sven   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1656860#c5)  F. Bernattzki    2019-01-14 16:01:25 UTC  ``` Is there any timeline for fixing this?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1656860#c6)  Jiří Vymazal    2019-01-15 08:25:42 UTC  ``` (In reply to F. Bernattzki from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1656860#c5)) > Is there any timeline for fixing this?  This bug is currently being evaluated regarding inclusion in next release/rsyslog update. The timeline will depend on result of that.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1656860#c8)  Sven    2019-02-06 09:28:59 UTC  ``` Hi Jiří,  any news on this? Is there a releasedate for a new version including the fix?  Regards, Sven   ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=1656860#c35)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-06 12:48:13 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.  For information on the advisory, and where to find the updated files, follow the link below.  If the solution does not work for you, open a new bug report.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1685901#c0)  Aniket Bhavsar    2019-03-06 09:24:37 UTC  ``` Description of problem: rsyslog floods log files when watching files through a symlink  When using imfile to watch a file where the path contains a symlink, one error per second (every second, indefinitely) will be logged by rsyslog. While the file in question is still logged as expected, the log flooding is highly undesirable.  The relevant config looks like this:  $ModLoad imfile  $InputFileName /var/lib/mysql/mysql-slow.log $InputFileTag mysqlslow-query: $InputFileStateFile mysqlslow-query $InputFileSeverity debug $InputFileFacility local1 $InputRunFileMonitor  /var/lib/mysql is a symlink, like so:  # ls -l /var/lib/mysql lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 24 Aug 30  2017 /var/lib/mysql -> /mnt/edata/var/lib/mysql  As a result, we see this:  (...) Feb 15 14:11:19 testabc rsyslogd: imfile: '/var/lib/mysql' is FILE but DIRECTORY expected - ignored [v8.24.0-34.el7] Feb 15 14:11:20 testabc rsyslogd: imfile: '/var/lib/mysql' is FILE but DIRECTORY expected - ignored [v8.24.0-34.el7] Feb 15 14:11:21 testabc rsyslogd: imfile: '/var/lib/mysql' is FILE but DIRECTORY expected - ignored [v8.24.0-34.el7] (...)  When using /mnt/edata/var/lib/mysql/mysql-slow.log directly in the config file, we don't see the above. However, being able to use symlinks here is highly desirable.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): v8.24.0-34.el7  How reproducible: Add a symbolic link to an existing log file.  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Define imfile module. 2. Create a symbolic link. 3. Check logs files for error like:  rsyslogd: imfile: '/var/lib/mysql' is FILE but DIRECTORY expected - ignored [v8.24.0-34.el7]  Actual results: rsyslogd: imfile: '/var/lib/mysql' is FILE but DIRECTORY expected - ignored [v8.24.0-34.el7]  Expected results: Logs should be generated without any errors.  Additional info:   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1685901#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-06 12:48:13 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1683804#c0)  Laura Pardo    2019-02-27 21:01:45 UTC  ``` A vulnerability was found in OpenSSL 1.0.2. When an application encounters a fatal protocol error and then calls SSL_shutdown() twice, OpenSSL can respond differently to the calling application if a 0 byte record is received with invalid padding compared to if a 0 byte record is received with an invalid MAC. This difference in behaviour can be detected by a remote peer, then this amounts to a padding oracle that could be used to decrypt data. In order for this to be exploitable "non-stitched" ciphersuites must be in use. Also the application must call SSL_shutdown() twice even if a protocol error has occurred (applications should not do this but some do anyway). AEAD ciphersuites are not impacted. This issue does not impact OpenSSL 1.1.1 or 1.1.0.   Upstream bug: <https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20190226.txt>  Upstream Patch: <https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/e9bbefbf0f24c57645e7ad6a5a71ae649d18ac8e>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1683804#c1)  Laura Pardo    2019-02-27 21:02:11 UTC  ``` Created compat-openssl10 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1683808](show_bug.cgi?id=1683808 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-1559 compat-openssl10: openssl: 0-byte record padding oracle [fedora-all]")]   Created mingw-openssl tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1683806](show_bug.cgi?id=1683806 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2019-1559 mingw-openssl: openssl: 0-byte record padding oracle [epel-7]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1683805](show_bug.cgi?id=1683805 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2019-1559 mingw-openssl: openssl: 0-byte record padding oracle [fedora-all]")]   Created openssl tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1683807](show_bug.cgi?id=1683807 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2019-1559 openssl: 0-byte record padding oracle [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1683804#c2)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2019-02-28 06:17:25 UTC  ``` Note: <https://github.com/RUB-NDS/TLS-Padding-Oracles>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1683804#c3)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2019-02-28 08:10:45 UTC  ``` This is essentially a padding oracle flaw, which needs the following conditions for exploitation:  1. Non-stitched cipher suites are used. (<https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/improving-openssl-performance> talks about stitching cipher suites) 2. AES-NI is not used. 3. Applications must call SSL_shutdown() twice even if a protocol error has occurred  4. The attacker must be able to run a script in the victim's browser which sends requests to a vulnerable website. This can be achieved tempting the victim to visit a malicious website. Second, the attacker must be able to modify requests sent by the browser and observe the server behavior. The second prerequisite is much harder to achieve, because the attacker must be an active Man-in-the-Middle.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1683804#c4)  Huzaifa S.

Sidhpurwala    2020-03-31 03:10:40 UTC  ``` Statement:  1 For this issue to be exploitable, the (server) application using the OpenSSL library needs to use it incorrectly. 2. There are multiple other requirements for the attack to succeed:      - The ciphersuite used must be obsolete CBC cipher without a stitched implementation (or the system be in FIPS mode)     - the attacker has to be a MITM     - the attacker has to be able to control the client side to send requests to the buggy server on demand   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=1683804#c32)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2020-03-31 03:12:34 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  As a workaround you can disable SHA384 if applications (compiled with OpenSSL) allow for adjustment of the ciphersuite string configuration.   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1658366#c0)  Laura Pardo    2018-12-11 21:05:40 UTC  ``` An issue was found in rsyslog. When imtcp module and Octet-Counted TCP Framing ("on" by default) are enabled, Rsyslog can be crashed remotely when sending an crafted (improperly formatted) message to "imptcp" listening socket.   Upstream Patch: <https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/commit/0381a0de64a5a048c3d48b79055bd9848d0c7fc2>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1658366#c4)  Doran Moppert    2018-12-14 04:09:22 UTC  ``` This vulnerability appears to have been introduced in upstream commit 6c52f29d59, which was first included in release 8.13.1.  > optimized payload-copy in processDataRcvd for octate-counted frames (as length is pre-known, it is possible to avoid coping char by char, as opposed to octate-stuffed frames).   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1658366#c7)  Laura Pardo    2018-12-18 19:37:06 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Joel Miller (Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1658366#c8)  Doran Moppert    2018-12-19 03:31:51 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  This vulnerability requires the "imptcp" module to be enabled, and listening on a port that can potentially be reached by attackers. This module is not enabled by default in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. To check if imptcp is enabled, look for the string `$InputPTCPServerRun`in your rsyslog configuration.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1658366#c12)  Mark D. Foster    2019-02-05 23:17:36 UTC  ``` shouldn't it say imtcp (instead of imptcp)?   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1658366#c13)  Jiří Vymazal    2019-02-06 08:16:33 UTC  ``` (In reply to Mark D.

Package        : rsyslog
Version        : 8.24.0-1+deb9u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-16881 CVE-2022-24903
Debian Bug     : 1010619

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in rsyslog, a system and
kernel logging daemon. When a log server is configured to accept logs
from remote clients through specific modules such as 'imptcp', an
attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) and possibly execute code
on the server.

CVE-2018-16881

    A denial of service vulnerability was found in rsyslog
    in the imptcp module. An attacker could send a specially crafted
    message to the imptcp socket, which would cause rsyslog to crash.

CVE-2022-24903

    Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap buffer
    overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a
    segfault or some other malfunction.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
8.24.0-1+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your rsyslog packages.

For the detailed security status of rsyslog please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/rsyslog>

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
