Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2018-16173:

**Root Cause:** The LearnPress WordPress plugin contains a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is susceptible to XSS attacks, which means that an attacker can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:**  A successful XSS attack allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    *   Stealing session cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate the user.
    *   Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    *   Modifying the content of the web page.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is via a web browser. An attacker injects malicious scripts into the LearnPress plugin that are then executed when another user views the page.
*   The vulnerability is triggered through user interaction (UI:R), meaning the victim must take an action such as clicking a link with the malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated (PR:N) to inject the malicious script, but the user being attacked must interact with the injected script.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided text indicates the vulnerability affects LearnPress versions prior to 3.1.0.
*   The CVSS v3 base score for the XSS vulnerability is 6.1 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)
*   The CVSS v2 base score for the XSS vulnerability is 2.6 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)
