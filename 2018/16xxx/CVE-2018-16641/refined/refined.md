The provided content relates to CVE-2018-16641.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a potential memory leak in the `TIFFWritePhotoshopLayers` function within the `coders/tiff.c` file of ImageMagick. The issue arises because, in several error handling scenarios within this function, allocated memory for `base_image` is not released before the function exits, leading to a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: Specifically, the `base_image` is not freed when `ThrowBinaryException` is called under certain conditions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Repeated triggers of the memory leak could lead to excessive memory consumption, potentially causing denial-of-service conditions, especially in environments that process many TIFF images.

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing a specially crafted TIFF image that triggers the error conditions within the `TIFFWritePhotoshopLayers` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious TIFF image file to be processed by ImageMagick. No special privileges or network positions are required.

**Additional Details:**
The provided commit diff shows that `DestroyImage(base_image)` has been added before calling  `ThrowBinaryException` in the identified vulnerable code locations, fixing the memory leak issue.
