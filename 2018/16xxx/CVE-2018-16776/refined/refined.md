- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the "Site Name" field of the WityCMS configuration page before storing it in the database.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The unsanitized input allows injection of arbitrary web scripts or HTML.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities. The injected script executes when the "Site Name" field is rendered on a page.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator in the WityCMS web interface. The attacker injects the malicious payload through the "Site Name" field in the configuration page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative access to WityCMS. They must also be able to navigate to the "Contact" "Configuration" page to modify the "Site Name" field.
