The provided content relates to CVE-2018-16729.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of uploaded SVG files. Specifically, the application allows users to upload SVG files containing embedded JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability: The application fails to sanitize SVG files, allowing embedded JavaScript to be executed when the SVG file is accessed directly via URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- When a user directly accesses the uploaded SVG file, the embedded JavaScript code will execute within the user's browser. An attacker can inject malicious scripts, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing sensitive information (e.g. cookies)
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing the website
    - Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker uploads a malicious SVG file containing JavaScript code to the "manage files" section of the application.
- The attacker then needs a user to directly access the uploaded SVG file via its URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account with the privileges to upload files to the "manage files" area within the application.
- The attacker needs to know the URL where the SVG file is stored to exploit the vulnerability.
