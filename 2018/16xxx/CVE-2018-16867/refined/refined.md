{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Path traversal vulnerability due to improper filename sanitization in the `usb_mtp_write_data` function in `hw/usb/dev-mtp.c` of the Media Transfer Protocol (MTP).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input sanitization",
      "Path traversal"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker inside the guest can read or write arbitrary files on the host system, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) or potentially arbitrary code execution on the host.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious guest device mounted in read-write mode on a vulnerable QEMU instance can write files outside of the intended path.",
      "An attacker can craft malicious MTP commands with directory traversal sequences to write files to arbitrary locations on the host's filesystem."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a guest OS running in QEMU and have the ability to mount the malicious device in read-write mode using MTP."
