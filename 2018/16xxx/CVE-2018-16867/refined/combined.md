Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-88a98ce795
2019-03-25 06:03:54.829903
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : qemu
Product : Fedora 29
Version : 3.0.0
Release : 4.fc29
URL : <http://www.qemu.org/>
Summary : QEMU is a FAST! processor emulator
Description :
QEMU is a generic and open source processor emulator which achieves a good
emulation speed by using dynamic translation. QEMU has two operating modes:

\* Full system emulation. In this mode, QEMU emulates a full system (for
example a PC), including a processor and various peripherials. It can be
used to launch different Operating Systems without rebooting the PC or
to debug system code.
\* User mode emulation. In this mode, QEMU can launch Linux processes compiled
for one CPU on another CPU.

As QEMU requires no host kernel patches to run, it is safe and easy to use.

Subject: CVE-2018-16867 QEMU: dev-mtp: path traversal in usb_mtp_write_data
 of the Media Transfer Protocol (MTP)

   Hello,

A flaw was found in qemu Media Transfer Protocol (MTP). A path traversal in
the in usb_mtp_write_data function in hw/usb/dev-mtp.c due to an improper
filename sanitization. When the guest device is mounted in read-write mode,
this allows to read/write arbitrary files which may lead do DoS scenario OR
possibly lead to code execution on the host.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2018-12/msg00390.html>

This issue was reported by Michael Hanselmann of hansmi.ch.

Thank you.

## Details

Michael Hanselmann discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the Media

Transfer Protocol (MTP). An attacker inside the guest could use this issue

to read or write arbitrary files and cause a denial of service, or possibly

execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.10.

([CVE-2018-16867](/security/CVE-2018-16867))

Michael Hanselmann discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the Media

Transfer Protocol (MTP). An attacker inside the guest could use this issue

to read arbitrary files, contrary to expectations. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.10. ([CVE-2018-16872](/security/CVE-2018-16872))

Zhibin Hu discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the Plan 9 File System

support. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to

crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-19489](/security/CVE-2018-19489))

Li Quang and Saar Amar discovered multiple issues in the QEMU PVRDMA

device. An attacker inside the guest could use these issues to cause a

denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 18.10. These issues were resolved by disabling PVRDMA

support in Ubuntu 18.10. ([CVE-2018-20123](/security/CVE-2018-20123), [CVE-2018-20124](/security/CVE-2018-20124), [CVE-2018-20125](/security/CVE-2018-20125),

[CVE-2018-20126](/security/CVE-2018-20126), [CVE-2018-20191](/security/CVE-2018-20191), [CVE-2018-20216](/security/CVE-2018-20216))

Michael Hanselmann discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled certain i2c

commands. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to read QEMU

process memory. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.10.

([CVE-2019-3812](/security/CVE-2019-3812))

It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the Slirp networking

back-end. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU

to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary

code on the host. In the default installation, when QEMU is used with
