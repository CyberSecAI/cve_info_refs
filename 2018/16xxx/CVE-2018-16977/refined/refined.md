The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities found in Monstra CMS V3.0.4. While this is not the official CVE description, it gives details on the issues mentioned in CVE-2018-16977

Here's a breakdown:

**Vulnerability 1: Sensitive Information Leakage**

*   **Root Cause:** The application's error handling mechanism discloses sensitive system information when an exception occurs, specifically the system's PATH environment variable.
*   **Weaknesses:** Information disclosure vulnerability due to excessive error information being displayed to the user.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive information like system paths, potentially revealing internal configuration details and software versions which can be used to further exploit the system.
*   **Attack Vector:** Direct HTTP request to the vulnerable `exception.php` error handler file.
*   **Required Capabilities:**  No special capabilities are required. The attacker only needs access to the vulnerable path.

**Vulnerability 2: HTTP Header Injection**

*   **Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `cfg` parameter in `cryptographp.php`, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers via newline characters (`%0D%0A`).
*   **Weaknesses:** HTTP Header Injection.
*   **Impact:**  Attackers can inject arbitrary HTTP headers such as `Set-Cookie` headers, potentially leading to session hijacking or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vector:**  HTTP request to `cryptographp.php` with a crafted `cfg` parameter containing newline characters.
*   **Required Capabilities:**  No special capabilities are required. The attacker only needs access to the vulnerable path.

**Vulnerability 3: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:**  The application fails to properly sanitize user input in the registration form (specifically the `password` field), leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to unsanitized user input.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes when a user views the affected page, potentially allowing for session hijacking, cookie theft, or other client-side attacks.
*   **Attack Vector:**  HTTP POST request to the registration page (`/monstra-master/users/registration`) with malicious JavaScript code in the `password` field.
*   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to create a user account using the vulnerable registration form.

**Summary of vulnerabilities**
The content describes three separate vulnerabilities in Monstra CMS: an information disclosure via the error handler, an HTTP header injection vulnerability and a stored XSS vulnerability in user registration form. These vulnerabilities, when exploited, can allow an attacker to potentially gain unauthorized access to the system, steal user credentials, perform malicious actions on a user's behalf, or gather sensitive information.
