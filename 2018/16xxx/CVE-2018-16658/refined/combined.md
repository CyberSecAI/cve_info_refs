cdrom: Fix info leak/OOB read in cdrom\_ioctl\_drive\_statusLike d88b6d04: "cdrom: information leak in cdrom\_ioctl\_media\_changed()"
There is another cast from unsigned long to int which causes
a bounds check to fail with specially crafted input. The value is
then used as an index in the slot array in cdrom\_slot\_status().

# USN-3820-3: Linux kernel (Azure) vulnerabilities

14 November 2018

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-azure](/security/cves?package=linux-azure) - Linux kernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems

## Details

Felix Wilhelm discovered that the Xen netback driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly perform input validation in some situations. An attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-15471](/security/CVE-2018-15471))

It was discovered that the generic SCSI driver in the Linux kernel did not

properly enforce permissions on kernel memory access. A local attacker

could use this to expose sensitive information or possibly elevate

privileges. ([CVE-2017-13168](/security/CVE-2017-13168))

It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the CD-ROM driver of

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-16658](/security/CVE-2018-16658))

It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the HID Bluetooth

implementation in the Linux kernel that could lead to a buffer overwrite.

An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-9363](/security/CVE-2018-9363))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1628378#c0)  David Jeffery    2018-09-12 20:45:36 UTC  ``` A customer had a dm-cache device set up to cache for a thin rbd device.  The dm-cache device was mounted and used for an xfs filesystem.  The customer was running fstrim to periodically discard unused blocks of the xfs filesystem.  However, the customer noticed that the space used for the rbd device never went down regardless of how much data was removed from the xfs filesystem or how fstrim was run.  On a local test system, it was also seen that dm-cache does not pass discards through the dm-cache device.  blktrace of the dm-cache device would show discard I/Os sent by xfs to the dm-cache device when running fstrim.  But blktrace attached to the origin device underlying the dm-cache device would never see any discards.  In its process_discard_bio function, dm-cache examines a discard bio and records block regions discarded by the discard bio in dm-cache's metadata.  It then completes the bio without sending any discard bio to its origin or cache-providing device.  Consequently, the origin device for a dm-cache device always functions as if it is thick.  No discard ever reaches it to allow it to release no longer used blocks.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): kernel-3.10.0-862.el7  How reproducible: Reproducible with discard-supporting storage.  Steps to Reproduce: 1.  Create dm-cache device on top of storage which supports discard. 2.  mkfs the dm-cache device as xfs and mount the xfs filesystem 3.  Have blktrace listen to the origin storage device. 4.  Run fstrim against the xfs filesystem. 5.  The blktrace output will show no discard I/Os sent to the origin device even as fstrim reports sending discards  Actual results: Discard does not occur on thin storage under dm-cache device  Expected results: Discard should release unused storage even with dm-cache in use.  Additional info: Upstream has the same behavior.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1628378#c2)  John Pittman    2018-09-13 13:29:13 UTC  ``` Verifying on virtual system.  I/O not being passed down.

For this reason lvm2 provides caching of thin-pool data LV not the thinLV itself - so thinLV provides a trimming capability, while caching of is handling on data chunk level.   This solution however has also it's limits as lvm2 ATM is not providing automatic extension of cached dataLV.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1628378#c10)  Bruno Meneguele    2019-03-08 20:48:47 UTC  ``` Patch(es) committed on kernel-3.10.0-1017.el7   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1628378#c13)  Roman Bednář    2019-07-04 10:04:47 UTC  ``` Marking verified, discard is now passed down to underlying device of dm-cache properly.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel
* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-kvm](/security/cves?package=linux-kvm) - Linux kernel for cloud environments
* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2
* [linux-snapdragon](/security/cves?package=linux-snapdragon) - Linux kernel for Snapdragon processors

## Details

Noam Rathaus discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

Infiniband implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-14734](/security/CVE-2018-14734))

It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the CD-ROM driver of

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-16658](/security/CVE-2018-16658))

It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the HID Bluetooth

implementation in the Linux kernel that could lead to a buffer overwrite.

An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-9363](/security/CVE-2018-9363))

Yves Younan discovered that the CIPSO labeling implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle IP header options in some situations. A

remote attacker could use this to specially craft network traffic that

could cause a denial of service (infinite loop). ([CVE-2018-10938](/security/CVE-2018-10938))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

mismanages the #BP and #OF exceptions. A local attacker in a guest virtual

machine could use this to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash).

([CVE-2016-9588](/security/CVE-2016-9588))

It was discovered that the generic SCSI driver in the Linux kernel did not

properly enforce permissions on kernel memory access. A local attacker

could use this to expose sensitive information or possibly elevate

privileges. ([CVE-2017-13168](/security/CVE-2017-13168))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the CDC USB Ethernet driver did not

properly validate device descriptors. A physically proximate attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-16649](/security/CVE-2017-16649))

It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the CD-ROM driver of

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-16658](/security/CVE-2018-16658))

It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the HID Bluetooth

implementation in the Linux kernel that could lead to a buffer overwrite.

An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-9363](/security/CVE-2018-9363))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.13.0-162-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-162.212~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-162.212~precise1)
* [linux-image-generic-lpae-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0.162.152](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-162.212~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-162-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-162.212~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-162.212~precise1)
* [linux-image-generic-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0.162.152](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-162.212~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if

                 CVE-2018-16658 CVE-2018-17182

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2018-6554

    A memory leak in the irda_bind function in the irda subsystem was
    discovered. A local user can take advantage of this flaw to cause a
    denial of service (memory consumption).

CVE-2018-6555

    A flaw was discovered in the irda_setsockopt function in the irda
    subsystem, allowing a local user to cause a denial of service
    (use-after-free and system crash).

CVE-2018-7755

    Brian Belleville discovered a flaw in the fd_locked_ioctl function
    in the floppy driver in the Linux kernel. The floppy driver copies a
    kernel pointer to user memory in response to the FDGETPRM ioctl. A
    local user with access to a floppy drive device can take advantage
    of this flaw to discover the location kernel code and data.

CVE-2018-9363

    It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not
    correctly check the length of received report messages. A paired
    HIDP device could use this to cause a buffer overflow, leading to
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or potentially
    remote code execution.

CVE-2018-9516

    It was discovered that the HID events interface in debugfs did not
    correctly limit the length of copies to user buffers.  A local
    user with access to these files could use this to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.  However, by default debugfs is only
    accessible by the root user.

CVE-2018-10902

    It was discovered that the rawmidi kernel driver does not protect
    against concurrent access which leads to a double-realloc (double
    free) flaw. A local attacker can take advantage of this issue for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-10938

    Yves Younan from Cisco reported that the Cipso IPv4 module did not
    correctly check the length of IPv4 options. On custom kernels with
    CONFIG_NETLABEL enabled, a remote attacker could use this to cause
    a denial of service (hang).

CVE-2018-13099

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a use-after-free bug in the
    F2FS implementation. An attacker able to mount a crafted F2FS
    volume could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-14609

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a potential null pointer
    dereference in the F2FS implementation. An attacker able to mount
    a crafted F2FS volume could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-14617

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a potential null pointer
    dereference in the HFS+ implementation. An attacker able to mount
    a crafted HFS+ volume could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-14633

    Vincent Pelletier discovered a stack-based buffer overflow flaw in
    the chap_server_compute_md5() function in the iSCSI target code. An
    unauthenticated remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to
    cause a denial of service or possibly to get a non-authorized access
    to data exported by an iSCSI target.

CVE-2018-14678

    M. Vefa Bicakci and Andy Lutomirski discovered a flaw in the
    kernel exit code used on amd64 systems running as Xen PV guests.
    A local user could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2018-14734

    A use-after-free bug was discovered in the InfiniBand
    communication manager. A local user could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possible for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-15572

    Esmaiel Mohammadian Koruyeh, Khaled Khasawneh, Chengyu Song, and
    Nael Abu-Ghazaleh, from University of California, Riverside,
    reported a variant of Spectre variant 2, dubbed SpectreRSB. A
    local user may be able to use this to read sensitive information
    from processes owned by other users.

CVE-2018-15594

    Nadav Amit reported that some indirect function calls used in
    paravirtualised guests were vulnerable to Spectre variant 2.  A
    local user may be able to use this to read sensitive information
    from the kernel.

CVE-2018-16276

    Jann Horn discovered that the yurex driver did not correctly limit
    the length of copies to user buffers.  A local user with access to
    a yurex device node could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-16658

    It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS ioctl.  A user
    with access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-17182

    Jann Horn discovered that the vmacache_flush_all function mishandles
    sequence number overflows. A local user can take advantage of this
    flaw to trigger a use-after-free, causing a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or privilege escalation.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.110-3+deb9u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1746708#c0)  Prasad Pandit    2019-08-29 07:03:01 UTC  ``` An out-of-bounds access issue was found in the way Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor implements Coalesced MMIO write operation. It operates on a MMIO ring buffer 'struct kvm_coalesced_mmio' object, wherein write indices 'ring->first' and 'ring->last' value could be supplied by a host user-space process.  An unprivileged host user/process with access to '/dev/kvm' device could use this flaw to crash the host kernel resulting in DoS OR potentially escalate privileges on the system.

There is another cast from unsigned long to int which causes
a bounds check to fail with specially crafted input. The value is
then used as an index in the slot array in cdrom_slot_status().

                 CVE-2018-16658 CVE-2018-17182

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2018-6554

    A memory leak in the irda_bind function in the irda subsystem was
    discovered. A local user can take advantage of this flaw to cause a
    denial of service (memory consumption).

CVE-2018-6555

    A flaw was discovered in the irda_setsockopt function in the irda
    subsystem, allowing a local user to cause a denial of service
    (use-after-free and system crash).

CVE-2018-7755

    Brian Belleville discovered a flaw in the fd_locked_ioctl function
    in the floppy driver in the Linux kernel. The floppy driver copies a
    kernel pointer to user memory in response to the FDGETPRM ioctl. A
    local user with access to a floppy drive device can take advantage
    of this flaw to discover the location kernel code and data.

CVE-2018-9363

    It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not
    correctly check the length of received report messages. A paired
    HIDP device could use this to cause a buffer overflow, leading to
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or potentially
    remote code execution.

CVE-2018-9516

    It was discovered that the HID events interface in debugfs did not
    correctly limit the length of copies to user buffers.  A local
    user with access to these files could use this to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.  However, by default debugfs is only
    accessible by the root user.

CVE-2018-10902

    It was discovered that the rawmidi kernel driver does not protect
    against concurrent access which leads to a double-realloc (double
    free) flaw. A local attacker can take advantage of this issue for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-10938

    Yves Younan from Cisco reported that the Cipso IPv4 module did not
    correctly check the length of IPv4 options. On custom kernels with
    CONFIG_NETLABEL enabled, a remote attacker could use this to cause
    a denial of service (hang).

CVE-2018-13099

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a use-after-free bug in the
    F2FS implementation. An attacker able to mount a crafted F2FS
    volume could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-14609

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a potential null pointer
    dereference in the F2FS implementation. An attacker able to mount
    arbitrary F2FS volumes could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-14617

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported a potential null pointer
    dereference in the HFS+ implementation. An attacker able to mount
    arbitrary HFS+ volumes could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-14633

    Vincent Pelletier discovered a stack-based buffer overflow flaw in
    the chap_server_compute_md5() function in the iSCSI target code. An
    unauthenticated remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to
    cause a denial of service or possibly to get a non-authorized access
    to data exported by an iSCSI target.

CVE-2018-14678

    M. Vefa Bicakci and Andy Lutomirski discovered a flaw in the
    kernel exit code used on amd64 systems running as Xen PV guests.
    A local user could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2018-14734

    A use-after-free bug was discovered in the InfiniBand
    communication manager. A local user could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possible for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-15572

    Esmaiel Mohammadian Koruyeh, Khaled Khasawneh, Chengyu Song, and
    Nael Abu-Ghazaleh, from University of California, Riverside,
    reported a variant of Spectre variant 2, dubbed SpectreRSB. A
    local user may be able to use this to read sensitive information
    from processes owned by other users.

CVE-2018-15594

    Nadav Amit reported that some indirect function calls used in
    paravirtualised guests were vulnerable to Spectre variant 2.  A
    local user may be able to use this to read sensitive information
    from the kernel.

CVE-2018-16276

    Jann Horn discovered that the yurex driver did not correctly limit
    the length of copies to user buffers.  A local user with access to
    a yurex device node could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-16658

    It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS ioctl.  A user
    with access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-17182

    Jann Horn discovered that the vmacache_flush_all function mishandles
    sequence number overflows. A local user can take advantage of this
    flaw to trigger a use-after-free, causing a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or privilege escalation.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.110-3+deb9u5~deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.9 packages.

## Details

Felix Wilhelm discovered that the Xen netback driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly perform input validation in some situations. An attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-15471](/security/CVE-2018-15471))

It was discovered that the generic SCSI driver in the Linux kernel did not

properly enforce permissions on kernel memory access. A local attacker

could use this to expose sensitive information or possibly elevate

privileges. ([CVE-2017-13168](/security/CVE-2017-13168))

It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the CD-ROM driver of

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-16658](/security/CVE-2018-16658))

It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the HID Bluetooth

implementation in the Linux kernel that could lead to a buffer overwrite.

An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-9363](/security/CVE-2018-9363))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1026-kvm](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-kvm)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

x86/dumpstack: Don't dump kernel memory based on usermode RIP
commit 342db04ae71273322f0011384a9ed414df8bdae4 upstream.
show\_opcodes() is used both for dumping kernel instructions and for dumping
user instructions. If userspace causes #PF by jumping to a kernel address,
show\_opcodes() can be reached with regs->ip controlled by the user,
pointing to kernel code. Make sure that userspace can't trick us into
dumping kernel memory into dmesg.

watchdog: Mark watchdog touch functions as notrace
commit cb9d7fd51d9fbb329d182423bd7b92d0f8cb0e01 upstream.
Some architectures need to use stop\_machine() to patch functions for
ftrace, and the assumption is that the stopped CPUs do not make function
calls to traceable functions when they are in the stopped state.
Commit ce4f06dcbb5d ("stop\_machine: Touch\_nmi\_watchdog() after
MULTI\_STOP\_PREPARE") added calls to the watchdog touch functions from
the stopped CPUs and those functions lack notrace annotations. This
leads to crashes when enabling/disabling ftrace on ARM kernels built
with the Thumb-2 instruction set.
Fix it by adding the necessary notrace annotations.

power: generic-adc-battery: check for duplicate properties copied from iio channels
commit a427503edaaed9b75ed9746a654cece7e93e60a8 upstream.
If an iio channel defines a basic property, there are duplicate entries
in /sys/class/power/\*/uevent.
So add a check to avoid duplicates. Since all channels may be duplicates,
we have to modify the related error check.

power: generic-adc-battery: fix out-of-bounds write when copying channel properties
commit 932d47448c3caa0fa99e84d7f5bc302aa286efd8 upstream.
We did have sporadic problems in the pinctrl framework during boot
where a pin group name unexpectedly became NULL leading to a NULL
dereference in strcmp.
Detailled analysis of the failing cases did reveal that there were
two devm allocated objects close to each other. The second one was
the affected group\_desc in pinmux and the first one was the
psy\_desc->properties buffer of the gab driver.
Review of the gab code showed that the address calculation for
one memcpy() is wrong. It does
properties + sizeof(type) \* index
but C is defined to do the index multiplication already for
pointer + integer additions. Hence the factor was applied twice
and the memcpy() does write outside of the properties buffer.
Sometimes it happened to be the pinctrl and triggered the strcmp(NULL).
Anyways, it is overkill to use a memcpy() here instead of a simple
assignment, which is easier to read and has less risk for wrong
address calculations. So we change code to a simple assignment.
If we initialize the index to the first free location, we can even
remove the local variable 'properties'.
This bug seems to exist right from the beginning in 3.7-rc1 in

clk: npcm7xx: fix memory allocation
commit 450b6b9b169382205f88858541a8b79830262ce7 upstream.
One of the more common cases of allocation size calculations is finding
the size of a structure that has a zero-sized array at the end, along
with memory for some number of elements for that array. For example:
struct foo {
int stuff;
void \*entry[];
};
instance = kzalloc(sizeof(struct foo) + sizeof(void \*) \* count,
GFP\_KERNEL);
Instead of leaving these open-coded and prone to type mistakes, we can
now use the new struct\_size() helper:
instance = kzalloc(struct\_size(instance, entry, count), GFP\_KERNEL);
Notice that, currently, there is a bug during the allocation:
sizeof(npcm7xx\_clk\_data) should be sizeof(\*npcm7xx\_clk\_data)
Fix this bug by using struct\_size() in kzalloc()
This issue was detected with the help of Coccinelle.

mtd: rawnand: qcom: wait for desc completion in all BAM channels
commit 6f20070d51a20e489ef117603210264c6bcde8a5 upstream.
The BAM has 3 channels - tx, rx and command. command channel
is used for register read/writes, tx channel for data writes
and rx channel for data reads. Currently, the driver assumes the
transfer completion once it gets all the command descriptors
completed. Sometimes, there is race condition between data channel
(tx/rx) and command channel completion. In these cases,
the data present in buffer is not valid during small window
between command descriptor completion and data descriptor
completion.
This patch generates NAND transfer completion when both
(Data and Command) DMA channels have completed all its DMA
descriptors. It assigns completion callback in last
DMA descriptors of that channel and wait for completion.

mtd: rawnand: marvell: add suspend and resume hooks
commit bd9c3f9b3c00da322b5e784e820533f1598f690a upstream.
This patch restores the suspend and resume hooks that the old driver used
to have. Apart from stopping and starting the clocks, the resume callback
also nullifies the selected\_chip pointer, so the next command that is issued
will re-select the chip and thereby restore the timing registers.
Factor out some code from marvell\_nfc\_init() into a new function
marvell\_nfc\_reset() and also call it at resume time to reset some registers
that don't retain their contents during low-power mode.
Without this patch, a PXA3xx based system would cough up an error similar to
the one below after resume.

iscsi target: fix session creation failure handling
commit 26abc916a898d34c5ad159315a2f683def3c5555 upstream.
The problem is that iscsi\_login\_zero\_tsih\_s1 sets conn->sess early in
iscsi\_login\_set\_conn\_values. If the function fails later like when we
alloc the idr it does kfree(sess) and leaves the conn->sess pointer set.
iscsi\_login\_zero\_tsih\_s1 then returns -Exyz and we then call
iscsi\_target\_login\_sess\_out and access the freed memory.
This patch has iscsi\_login\_zero\_tsih\_s1 either completely setup the
session or completely tear it down, so later in
iscsi\_target\_login\_sess\_out we can just check for it being set to the
connection.

scsi: core: Avoid that SCSI device removal through sysfs triggers a deadlock
commit 0ee223b2e1f67cb2de9c0e3247c510d846e74d63 upstream.
A long time ago the unfortunate decision was taken to add a self-deletion
attribute to the sysfs SCSI device directory. That decision was unfortunate
because self-deletion is really tricky. We can't drop that attribute
because widely used user space software depends on it, namely the
rescan-scsi-bus.sh script. Hence this patch that avoids that writing into
that attribute triggers a deadlock. See also commit 7973cbd9fbd9 ("[PATCH]
add sysfs attributes to scan and delete scsi\_devices").
This patch avoids that self-removal triggers the following deadlock:

As a part of host reset operation, driver will flushout all IOs outstanding
at driver level with "DID\_RESET" result. To find which are all commands
outstanding at the driver level, driver loops with smid starting from one
to HBA queue depth and calls mpt3sas\_scsih\_scsi\_lookup\_get() to get scmd as
shown below
for (smid = 1; smid <= ioc->scsiio\_depth; smid++) {
scmd = mpt3sas\_scsih\_scsi\_lookup\_get(ioc, smid);
if (!scmd)
continue;
But in mpt3sas\_scsih\_scsi\_lookup\_get() function, driver returns some scsi
cmnds which are not outstanding at the driver level (possibly request is
constructed at block layer since QUEUE\_FLAG\_QUIESCED is not set. Even if
driver uses scsi\_block\_requests and scsi\_unblock\_requests, issue still
persists as they will be just blocking further IO from scsi layer and not
from block layer) and these commands are flushed with DID\_RESET host bytes
thus resulting into above kernel BUG.
This issue got introduced by commit dbec4c9040ed ("scsi: mpt3sas: lockless
command submission").
To fix this issue, we have modified the mpt3sas\_scsih\_scsi\_lookup\_get() to
check for smid equals to zero (note: whenever any scsi cmnd is processing
at the driver level then smid for that scsi cmnd will be non-zero, always
it starts from one) before it returns the scmd pointer to the caller. If
smid is zero then this function returns scmd pointer as NULL and driver
won't flushout those scsi cmnds at driver level with DID\_RESET host byte
thus this issue will not be observed.

tpm: separate cmd\_ready/go\_idle from runtime\_pm
commit 627448e85c766587f6fdde1ea3886d6615081c77 upstream.
Fix tpm ptt initialization error:
tpm tpm0: A TPM error (378) occurred get tpm pcr allocation.
We cannot use go\_idle cmd\_ready commands via runtime\_pm handles
as with the introduction of localities this is no longer an optional
feature, while runtime pm can be not enabled.
Though cmd\_ready/go\_idle provides a power saving, it's also a part of
TPM2 protocol and should be called explicitly.
This patch exposes cmd\_read/go\_idle via tpm class ops and removes
runtime pm support as it is not used by any driver.
When calling from nested context always use both flags:
TPM\_TRANSMIT\_UNLOCKED and TPM\_TRANSMIT\_RAW. Both are needed to resolve
tpm spaces and locality request recursive calls to tpm\_transmit().
TPM\_TRANSMIT\_RAW should never be used standalone as it will fail
on double locking. While TPM\_TRANSMIT\_UNLOCKED standalone should be
called from non-recursive locked contexts.
New wrappers are added tpm\_cmd\_ready() and tpm\_go\_idle() to
streamline tpm\_try\_transmit code.
tpm\_crb no longer needs own power saving functions and can drop using
tpm\_pm\_suspend/resume.
This patch cannot be really separated from the locality fix.

MIPS: lib: Provide MIPS64r6 \_\_multi3() for GCC < 7
commit 690d9163bf4b8563a2682e619f938e6a0443947f upstream.
Some versions of GCC suboptimally generate calls to the \_\_multi3()
intrinsic for MIPS64r6 builds, resulting in link failures due to the
missing function:
LD vmlinux.o
MODPOST vmlinux.o
kernel/bpf/verifier.o: In function `kmalloc\_array':
include/linux/slab.h:631: undefined reference to `\_\_multi3'
fs/select.o: In function `kmalloc\_array':
include/linux/slab.h:631: undefined reference to `\_\_multi3'
...
We already have a workaround for this in which we provide the
instrinsic, but we do so selectively for GCC 7 only. Unfortunately the
issue occurs with older GCC versions too - it has been observed with
both GCC 5.4.0 & GCC 6.4.0.
MIPSr6 support was introduced in GCC 5, so all major GCC versions prior
to GCC 8 are affected and we extend our workaround accordingly to all
MIPS64r6 builds using GCC versions older than GCC 8.

MIPS: Change definition of cpu\_relax() for Loongson-3
commit a30718868915fbb991a9ae9e45594b059f28e9ae upstream.
Linux expects that if a CPU modifies a memory location, then that
modification will eventually become visible to other CPUs in the system.
Loongson 3 CPUs include a Store Fill Buffer (SFB) which sits between a
core & its L1 data cache, queueing memory accesses & allowing for faster
forwarding of data from pending stores to younger loads from the core.
Unfortunately the SFB prioritizes loads such that a continuous stream of
loads may cause a pending write to be buffered indefinitely. This is
problematic if we end up with 2 CPUs which each perform a store that the
other polls for - one or both CPUs may end up with their stores buffered
in the SFB, never reaching cache due to the continuous reads from the
poll loop. Such a deadlock condition has been observed whilst running
qspinlock code.
This patch changes the definition of cpu\_relax() to smp\_mb() for
Loongson-3, forcing a flush of the SFB on SMP systems which will cause
any pending writes to make it as far as the L1 caches where they will
become visible to other CPUs. If the kernel is not compiled for SMP
support, this will expand to a barrier() as before.
This workaround matches that currently implemented for ARM when
CONFIG\_ARM\_ERRATA\_754327=y, which was introduced by commit 534be1d5a2da
("ARM: 6194/1: change definition of cpu\_relax() for ARM11MPCore").
Although the workaround is only required when the Loongson 3 SFB
functionality is enabled, and we only began explicitly enabling that
functionality in v4.7 with commit 1e820da3c9af ("MIPS: Loongson-3:
Introduce CONFIG\_LOONGSON3\_ENHANCEMENT"), existing or future firmware
may enable the SFB which means we may need the workaround backported to
earlier kernels too.

MIPS: Always use -march=, not - shortcuts
commit 344ebf09949c31bcb8818d8458b65add29f1d67b upstream.
The VDSO Makefile filters CFLAGS to select a subset which it uses whilst
building the VDSO ELF. One of the flags it allows through is the -march=
flag that selects the architecture/ISA to target.
Unfortunately in cases where CONFIG\_CPU\_MIPS32\_R{1,2}=y and the
toolchain defaults to building for MIPS64, the main MIPS Makefile ends
up using the short-form - flags in cflags-y. This is because the
calls to cc-option always fail to use the long-form -march= flag
due to the lack of an -mabi= flag in KBUILD\_CFLAGS at the point
where the cc-option function is executed. The resulting GCC invocation
is something like:
$ mips64-linux-gcc -Werror -march=mips32r2 -c -x c /dev/null -o tmp
cc1: error: '-march=mips32r2' is not compatible with the selected ABI
These short-form - flags are dropped by the VDSO Makefile's
filtering, and so we attempt to build the VDSO without specifying any
architecture. This results in an attempt to build the VDSO using
whatever the compiler's default architecture is, regardless of whether
that is suitable for the kernel configuration.
One encountered build failure resulting from this mismatch is a
rejection of the sync instruction if the kernel is configured for a
MIPS32 or MIPS64 r1 or r2 target but the toolchain defaults to an older
architecture revision such as MIPS1 which did not include the sync
instruction:

This can be reproduced for example by attempting to build
pistachio\_defconfig using Arnd's GCC 8.1.0 mips64 toolchain from
kernel.org:
https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/tools/crosstool/files/bin/x86\_64/8.1.0/x86\_64-gcc-8.1.0-nolibc-mips64-linux.tar.xz
Resolve this problem by using the long-form -march= in all cases,
which makes it through the arch/mips/vdso/Makefile's filtering & is thus
consistently used to build both the kernel proper & the VDSO.
The use of cc-option to prefer the long-form & fall back to the
short-form flags makes no sense since the short-form is just an
abbreviation for the also-supported long-form in all GCC versions that
we support building with. This means there is no case in which we have
to use the short-form - flags, so we can simply remove them.
The manual redefinition of \_MIPS\_ISA is removed naturally along with the
use of the short-form flags that it accompanied, and whilst here we
remove the separate assembler ISA selection. I suspect that both of
these were only required due to the mips32 vs mips2 mismatch that was
introduced by commit 59b3e8e9aac6 ("[MIPS] Makefile crapectomy.") and
fixed but not cleaned up by commit 9200c0b2a07c ("[MIPS] Fix Makefile
bugs for MIPS32/MIPS64 R1 and R2.").
I've marked this for backport as far as v4.4 where the MIPS VDSO was
introduced. In earlier kernels there should be no ill effect to using
the short-form flags.

commit 8d6a4b45018c0c95322dcd52ce0cb5dfd8caecd2

MIPS: memset.S: Fix byte\_fixup for MIPSr6
commit b1c03f1ef48d36ff28afb06e8f0c1233ef072f1d upstream.
The \_\_clear\_user function is defined to return the number of bytes that
could not be cleared. From the underlying memset / bzero implementation
this means setting register a2 to that number on return. Currently if a
page fault is triggered within the MIPSr6 version of setting of initial
unaligned bytes, the value loaded into a2 on return is meaningless.
During the MIPSr6 version of the initial unaligned bytes block, register
a2 contains the number of bytes to be set beyond the initial unaligned
bytes. The t0 register is initally set to the number of unaligned bytes
- STORSIZE, effectively a negative version of the number of unaligned
bytes. This is then incremented before each byte is saved.
The label .Lbyte\_fixup\@ is jumped to on page fault. Currently the value
in a2 is incorrectly replaced by 0 - t0 + 1, effectively the number of
unaligned bytes remaining. This leads to the failures being reported by
the following test code:
static int \_\_init test\_clear\_user(void)
{
int j, k;
pr\_info("\n\n\nTesting clear\_user\n");
for (j = 0; j < 512; j++) {
if ((k = clear\_user(NULL+3, j)) != j) {
pr\_err("clear\_user (NULL %d) returned %d\n", j, k);
}
}
return 0;
}
late\_initcall(test\_clear\_user);
Which reports:
[ 3.965439] Testing clear\_user
[ 3.973169] clear\_user (NULL 8) returned 6
[ 3.976782] clear\_user (NULL 9) returned 6
[ 3.980390] clear\_user (NULL 10) returned 6
[ 3.984052] clear\_user (NULL 11) returned 6
[ 3.987524] clear\_user (NULL 12) returned 6
Fix this by subtracting t0 from a2 (rather than $0), effectivey giving:
unset\_bytes = (#bytes - (#unaligned bytes)) - (-#unaligned bytes remaining + 1) + 1
a2 = a2 - t0 + 1
This fixes the value returned from \_\_clear user when the number of bytes
to set is > LONGSIZE and the address is invalid and unaligned.
Unfortunately, this breaks the fixup handling for unaligned bytes after
the final long, where register a2 still contains the number of bytes
remaining to be set and the t0 register is to 0 - the number of
unaligned bytes remaining.
Because t0 is now is now subtracted from a2 rather than 0, the number of
bytes unset is reported incorrectly:
static int \_\_init test\_clear\_user(void)
{
char \*test;
int j, k;
pr\_info("\n\n\nTesting clear\_user\n");
test = vmalloc(PAGE\_SIZE);
for (j = 256; j < 512; j++) {
if ((k = clear\_user(test + PAGE\_SIZE - 254, j)) != j - 254) {
pr\_err("clear\_user (%px %d) returned %d\n",
test + PAGE\_SIZE - 254, j, k);
}
}
return 0;
}
late\_initcall(test\_clear\_user);
[ 3.976775] clear\_user (c00000000000df02 256) returned 4
[ 3.981957] clear\_user (c00000000000df02 257) returned 6
[ 3.986425] clear\_user (c00000000000df02 258) returned 8
[ 3.990850] clear\_user (c00000000000df02 259) returned 10
[ 3.995332] clear\_user (c00000000000df02 260) returned 12
[ 3.999815] clear\_user (c00000000000df02 261) returned 14
Fix this by ensuring that a2 is set to 0 during the set of final
unaligned bytes.

MIPS: Correct the 64-bit DSP accumulator register size
commit f5958b4cf4fc38ed4583ab83fb7c4cd1ab05f47b upstream.
Use the `unsigned long' rather than `\_\_u32' type for DSP accumulator
registers, like with the regular MIPS multiply/divide accumulator and
general-purpose registers, as all are 64-bit in 64-bit implementations
and using a 32-bit data type leads to contents truncation on context
saving.
Update `arch\_ptrace' and `compat\_arch\_ptrace' accordingly, removing
casts that are similarly not used with multiply/divide accumulator or
general-purpose register accesses.

s390/purgatory: Fix crash with expoline enabled
commit ad03b821fbc30395b72af438f5bb41676a5f891d upstream.
When the kernel is built with CONFIG\_EXPOLINE=y and a compiler with
indirect branch mitigation enabled the purgatory crashes. The reason for
that is that the macros defined for expoline are used in mem.S. These
macros define new sections (.text.\_\_s390x\_indirect\_\*) which are marked
executable. Due to the missing linker script those sections are linked to
address 0, just as the .text section. In combination with the entry point
also being at address 0 this causes the purgatory load code
(kernel/kexec\_file.c: kexec\_purgatory\_setup\_sechdrs) to update the entry
point twice. Thus the old kernel jumps to some 'random' address causing the
crash.
To fix this turn off expolines for the purgatory. There is no problem with
this in this case due to the fact that the purgatory only runs once and the
tlb is purged (diag 308) in the end.

When allocating a new AOB fails, handle\_outbound() is still capable of

But if a previous transfer on this queue slot used async completion, its
sbal\_state flags field is still set to QDIO\_OUTBUF\_STATE\_FLAG\_PENDING.
So when the upper layer driver sees this stale flag, it expects an async
completion that never happens.
Fix this by unconditionally clearing the flags field.

x86/entry/64: Wipe KASAN stack shadow before rewind\_stack\_do\_exit()
commit f12d11c5c184626b4befdee3d573ec8237405a33 upstream.
Reset the KASAN shadow state of the task stack before rewinding RSP.
Without this, a kernel oops will leave parts of the stack poisoned, and
code running under do\_exit() can trip over such poisoned regions and cause
nonsensical false-positive KASAN reports about stack-out-of-bounds bugs.
This does not wipe the exception stacks; if an oops happens on an exception
stack, it might result in random KASAN false-positives from other tasks
afterwards. This is probably relatively uninteresting, since if the kernel
oopses on an exception stack, there are most likely bigger things to worry
about. It'd be more interesting if vmapped stacks and KASAN were
compatible, since then handle\_stack\_overflow() would oops from exception
stack context.

val can be indirectly controlled by user-space, hence leading to
a potential exploitation of the Spectre variant 1 vulnerability.
This issue was detected with the help of Smatch:
vers/hwmon/nct6775.c:2698 store\_pwm\_weight\_temp\_sel() warn: potential
spectre issue 'data->temp\_src' [r]
Fix this by sanitizing val before using it to index data->temp\_src
Notice that given that speculation windows are large, the policy is
to kill the speculation on the first load and not worry if it can be
completed with a dependent load/store [1].

x86/speculation/l1tf: Increase l1tf memory limit for Nehalem+
commit cc51e5428ea54f575d49cfcede1d4cb3a72b4ec4 upstream.
On Nehalem and newer core CPUs the CPU cache internally uses 44 bits
physical address space. The L1TF workaround is limited by this internal
cache address width, and needs to have one bit free there for the
mitigation to work.
Older client systems report only 36bit physical address space so the range
check decides that L1TF is not mitigated for a 36bit phys/32GB system with
some memory holes.
But since these actually have the larger internal cache width this warning
is bogus because it would only really be needed if the system had more than
43bits of memory.
Add a new internal x86\_cache\_bits field. Normally it is the same as the
physical bits field reported by CPUID, but for Nehalem and newerforce it to
be at least 44bits.
Change the L1TF memory size warning to use the new cache\_bits field to
avoid bogus warnings and remove the bogus comment about memory size.

x86/nmi: Fix NMI uaccess race against CR3 switching
commit 4012e77a903d114f915fc607d6d2ed54a3d6c9b1 upstream.
A NMI can hit in the middle of context switching or in the middle of
switch\_mm\_irqs\_off(). In either case, CR3 might not match current->mm,
which could cause copy\_from\_user\_nmi() and friends to read the wrong
memory.
Fix it by adding a new nmi\_uaccess\_okay() helper and checking it in
copy\_from\_user\_nmi() and in \_\_copy\_from\_user\_nmi()'s callers.

the codecs which are not supporting the current stream direction.
At the moment, if a BE link has more than one codec, and only one
of these codecs has no capture DAI, it becomes impossible to start
a capture stream because the merged format would be 0.

can be sure that no more requests are outstanding.

KVM: x86: SVM: Call x86\_spec\_ctrl\_set\_guest/host() with interrupts disabled
commit 024d83cadc6b2af027e473720f3c3da97496c318 upstream.
Mikhail reported the following lockdep splat:
WARNING: possible irq lock inversion dependency detected
CPU 0/KVM/10284 just changed the state of lock:
000000000d538a88 (&st->lock){+...}, at:
speculative\_store\_bypass\_update+0x10b/0x170
but this lock was taken by another, HARDIRQ-safe lock
in the past:
(&(&sighand->siglock)->rlock){-.-.}
and interrupts could create inverse lock ordering between them.
Possible interrupt unsafe locking scenario:
CPU0 CPU1
---- ----
lock(&st->lock);
local\_irq\_disable();
lock(&(&sighand->siglock)->rlock);
lock(&st->lock);
lock(&(&sighand->siglock)->rlock);
\*\*\* DEADLOCK \*\*\*
The code path which connects those locks is:
speculative\_store\_bypass\_update()
ssb\_prctl\_set()
do\_seccomp()
do\_syscall\_64()
In svm\_vcpu\_run() speculative\_store\_bypass\_update() is called with
interupts enabled via x86\_virt\_spec\_ctrl\_set\_guest/host().
This is actually a false positive, because GIF=0 so interrupts are
disabled even if IF=1; however, we can easily move the invocations of
x86\_virt\_spec\_ctrl\_set\_guest/host() into the interrupt disabled region to
cure it, and it's a good idea to keep the GIF=0/IF=1 area as small
and self-contained as possible.

KVM: x86: ensure all MSRs can always be KVM\_GET/SET\_MSR'd
commit 44883f01fe6ae436a8604c47d8435276fef369b0 upstream.
Some of the MSRs returned by GET\_MSR\_INDEX\_LIST currently cannot be sent back
to KVM\_GET\_MSR and/or KVM\_SET\_MSR; either they can never be sent back, or you
they are only accepted under special conditions. This makes the API a pain to
use.
To avoid this pain, this patch makes it so that the result of the get-list
ioctl can always be used for host-initiated get and set. Since we don't have
a separate way to check for read-only MSRs, this means some Hyper-V MSRs are
ignored when written. Arguably they should not even be in the result of
GET\_MSR\_INDEX\_LIST, but I am leaving there in case userspace is using the
outcome of GET\_MSR\_INDEX\_LIST to derive the support for the corresponding
Hyper-V feature.

x86/speculation/l1tf: Fix off-by-one error when warning that system has too much RAM
commit b0a182f875689647b014bc01d36b340217792852 upstream.
Two users have reported [1] that they have an "extremely unlikely" system
with more than MAX\_PA/2 memory and L1TF mitigation is not effective. In
fact it's a CPU with 36bits phys limit (64GB) and 32GB memory, but due to
holes in the e820 map, the main region is almost 500MB over the 32GB limit:
[ 0.000000] BIOS-e820: [mem 0x0000000100000000-0x000000081effffff] usable
Suggestions to use 'mem=32G' to enable the L1TF mitigation while losing the
500MB revealed, that there's an off-by-one error in the check in
l1tf\_select\_mitigation().
l1tf\_pfn\_limit() returns the last usable pfn (inclusive) and the range
check in the mitigation path does not take this into account.
Instead of amending the range check, make l1tf\_pfn\_limit() return the first
PFN which is over the limit which is less error prone. Adjust the other
users accordingly.

x86/speculation/l1tf: Fix overflow in l1tf\_pfn\_limit() on 32bit
commit 9df9516940a61d29aedf4d91b483ca6597e7d480 upstream.
On 32bit PAE kernels on 64bit hardware with enough physical bits,
l1tf\_pfn\_limit() will overflow unsigned long. This in turn affects
max\_swapfile\_size() and can lead to swapon returning -EINVAL. This has been
observed in a 32bit guest with 42 bits physical address size, where
max\_swapfile\_size() overflows exactly to 1 << 32, thus zero, and produces
the following warning to dmesg:

mm/tlb, x86/mm: Support invalidating TLB caches for RCU\_TABLE\_FREE
commit d86564a2f085b79ec046a5cba90188e612352806 upstream.
Jann reported that x86 was missing required TLB invalidates when he
hit the !\*batch slow path in tlb\_remove\_table().
This is indeed the case; RCU\_TABLE\_FREE does not provide TLB (cache)
invalidates, the PowerPC-hash where this code originated and the
Sparc-hash where this was subsequently used did not need that. ARM
which later used this put an explicit TLB invalidate in their
\_\_p\*\_free\_tlb() functions, and PowerPC-radix followed that example.
But when we hooked up x86 we failed to consider this. Fix this by
(optionally) hooking tlb\_remove\_table() into the TLB invalidate code.
NOTE: s390 was also needing something like this and might now
be able to use the generic code again.
[ Modified to be on top of Nick's cleanups, which simplified this patch
now that tlb\_flush\_mmu\_tlbonly() really only flushes the TLB - Linus ]

x86/gpu: reserve ICL's graphics stolen memory
commit db0c8d8b031d2b5960f6407f7f2ca20e97e00605 upstream.
ICL changes the registers and addresses to 64 bits.
I also briefly looked at implementing an u64 version of the PCI config
read functions, but I concluded this wouldn't be trivial, so it's not
worth doing it for a single user that can't have any racing problems
while reading the register in two separate operations.
v2:
- Scrub the development (non-public) changelog (Joonas).
- Remove the i915.ko bits so this can be easily backported in order
to properly avoid stolen memory even on machines without i915.ko
(Joonas).
- CC stable for the reasons above.

nvme-pci: add a memory barrier to nvme\_dbbuf\_update\_and\_check\_event
commit f1ed3df20d2d223e0852cc4ac1f19bba869a7e3c upstream.
In many architectures loads may be reordered with older stores to
different locations. In the nvme driver the following two operations
could be reordered:
- Write shadow doorbell (dbbuf\_db) into memory.
- Read EventIdx (dbbuf\_ei) from memory.
This can result in a potential race condition between driver and VM host
processing requests (if given virtual NVMe controller has a support for
shadow doorbell). If that occurs, then the NVMe controller may decide to
wait for MMIO doorbell from guest operating system, and guest driver may
decide not to issue MMIO doorbell on any of subsequent commands.
This issue is purely timing-dependent one, so there is no easy way to
reproduce it. Currently the easiest known approach is to run "Oracle IO
Numbers" (orion) that is shipped with Oracle DB:
orion -run advanced -num\_large 0 -size\_small 8 -type rand -simulate \
concat -write 40 -duration 120 -matrix row -testname nvme\_test
Where nvme\_test is a .lun file that contains a list of NVMe block
devices to run test against. Limiting number of vCPUs assigned to given
VM instance seems to increase chances for this bug to occur. On test
environment with VM that got 4 NVMe drives and 1 vCPU assigned the
virtual NVMe controller hang could be observed within 10-20 minutes.
That correspond to about 400-500k IO operations processed (or about
100GB of IO read/writes).
Orion tool was used as a validation and set to run in a loop for 36
hours (equivalent of pushing 550M IO operations). No issues were
observed. That suggest that the patch fixes the issue.

ext4: fix race when setting the bitmap corrupted flag

Whenever we hit block or inode bitmap corruptions we set
bit and then reduce this block group free inode/clusters
counter to expose right available space.
However some of ext4\_mark\_group\_bitmap\_corrupted() is called
inside group spinlock, some are not, this could make it happen
that we double reduce one block group free counters from system.
Always hold group spinlock for it could fix it, but it looks

commit a4d2aadca184ece182418950d45ba4ffc7b652d2 upstream.
While working on extended rand for last\_error/first\_error timestamps,
I noticed that the endianess is wrong; we access the little-endian

This adds a special case in ext4\_attr\_show() and ext4\_attr\_store()
to byteswap the superblock fields if needed.

Extended attribute names are defined to be NUL-terminated, so the name
must not contain a NUL character. This is important because there are
places when remove extended attribute, the code uses strlen to
determine the length of the entry. That should probably be fixed at
some point, but code is currently really messy, so the simplest fix
for now is to simply validate that the extended attributes are sane.

stop\_machine: Atomically queue and wake stopper threads
commit cfd355145c32bb7ccb65fccbe2d67280dc2119e1 upstream.
When cpu\_stop\_queue\_work() releases the lock for the stopper
thread that was queued into its wake queue, preemption is
enabled, which leads to the following deadlock:
CPU0 CPU1
sched\_setaffinity(0, ...)
\_\_set\_cpus\_allowed\_ptr()
stop\_one\_cpu(0, ...) stop\_two\_cpus(0, 1, ...)
cpu\_stop\_queue\_work(0, ...) cpu\_stop\_queue\_two\_works(0, ..., 1, ...)
-grabs lock for migration/0-
-spins with preemption disabled,
waiting for migration/0's lock to be
released-
-adds work items for migration/0
and queues migration/0 to its
wake\_q-
-releases lock for migration/0
and preemption is enabled-
-current thread is preempted,
and \_\_set\_cpus\_allowed\_ptr
has changed the thread's
cpu allowed mask to CPU1 only-
-acquires migration/0 and migration/1's
locks-
-adds work for migration/0 but does not
add migration/0 to wake\_q, since it is
already in a wake\_q-
-adds work for migration/1 and adds
migration/1 to its wake\_q-
-releases migration/0 and migration/1's
locks, wakes migration/1, and enables
preemption-
-since migration/1 is requested to run,
migration/1 begins to run and waits on
migration/0, but migration/0 will never
be able to run, since the thread that
can wake it is affine to CPU1-
Disable preemption in cpu\_stop\_queue\_work() before queueing works for
stopper threads, and queueing the stopper thread in the wake queue, to
ensure that the operation of queueing the works and waking the stopper
threads is atomic.

perf kvm: Fix subcommands on s390
commit 8a95c8994509c55abf1e38c0cc037b1205725e21 upstream.
With commit eca0fa28cd0d ("perf record: Provide detailed information on
s390 CPU") s390 platform provides detailed type/model/capacity
information in the CPU identifier string instead of just "IBM/S390".
This breaks 'perf kvm' support which uses hard coded string IBM/S390 to
compare with the CPU identifier string. Fix this by changing the
comparison.

s390/kvm: fix deadlock when killed by oom
commit 306d6c49ac9ded11114cb53b0925da52f2c2ada1 upstream.
When the oom killer kills a userspace process in the page fault handler
while in guest context, the fault handler fails to release the mm\_sem
if the FAULT\_FLAG\_RETRY\_NOWAIT option is set. This leads to a deadlock
when tearing down the mm when the process terminates. This bug can only
happen when pfault is enabled, so only KVM clients are affected.
The problem arises in the rare cases in which handle\_mm\_fault does not
release the mm\_sem. This patch fixes the issue by manually releasing
the mm\_sem when needed.

KVM: arm/arm64: Skip updating PMD entry if no change
commit 86658b819cd0a9aa584cd84453ed268a6f013770 upstream.
Contention on updating a PMD entry by a large number of vcpus can lead
to duplicate work when handling stage 2 page faults. As the page table
update follows the break-before-make requirement of the architecture,
it can lead to repeated refaults due to clearing the entry and
flushing the tlbs.
This problem is more likely when -
\* there are large number of vcpus
\* the mapping is large block mapping
such as when using PMD hugepages (512MB) with 64k pages.
Fix this by skipping the page table update if there is no change in
the entry being updated.

KVM: arm/arm64: Fix lost IRQs from emulated physcial timer when blocked
commit 245715cbe83ca934af5d20e078fd85175c62995e upstream.
When the VCPU is blocked (for example from WFI) we don't inject the
physical timer interrupt if it should fire while the CPU is blocked, but
instead we just wake up the VCPU and expect kvm\_timer\_vcpu\_load to take
care of injecting the interrupt.
Unfortunately, kvm\_timer\_vcpu\_load() doesn't actually do that, it only
has support to schedule a soft timer if the emulated phys timer is
expected to fire in the future.
Follow the same pattern as kvm\_timer\_update\_state() and update the irq
state after potentially scheduling a soft timer.

KVM: arm/arm64: Fix potential loss of ptimer interrupts
commit 7afc4ddbf299a13aaf28406783d141a34c6b4f5a upstream.
kvm\_timer\_update\_state() is called when changing the phys timer
configuration registers, either via vcpu reset, as a result of a trap
from the guest, or when userspace programs the registers.
phys\_timer\_emulate() is in turn called by kvm\_timer\_update\_state() to
either cancel an existing software timer, or program a new software
timer, to emulate the behavior of a real phys timer, based on the change
in configuration registers.
Unfortunately, the interaction between these two functions left a small
race; if the conceptual emulated phys timer should actually fire, but
the soft timer hasn't executed its callback yet, we cancel the timer in
phys\_timer\_emulate without injecting an irq. This only happens if the
check in kvm\_timer\_update\_state is called before the timer should fire,
which is relatively unlikely, but possible.
The solution is to update the state of the phys timer after calling
phys\_timer\_emulate, which will pick up the pending timer state and
update the interrupt value.
Note that this leaves the opportunity of raising the interrupt twice,
once in the just-programmed soft timer, and once in
kvm\_timer\_update\_state. Since this always happens synchronously with
the VCPU execution, there is no harm in this, and the guest ever only
sees a single timer interrupt.

arm64: mm: check for upper PAGE\_SHIFT bits in pfn\_valid()
commit 5ad356eabc47d26a92140a0c4b20eba471c10de3 upstream.
ARM64's pfn\_valid() shifts away the upper PAGE\_SHIFT bits of the input
before seeing if the PFN is valid. This leads to false positives when
some of the upper bits are set, but the lower bits match a valid PFN.
For example, the following userspace code looks up a bogus entry in
/proc/kpageflags:
int pagemap = open("/proc/self/pagemap", O\_RDONLY);
int pageflags = open("/proc/kpageflags", O\_RDONLY);
uint64\_t pfn, val;
lseek64(pagemap, [...], SEEK\_SET);
read(pagemap, &pfn, sizeof(pfn));
if (pfn & (1UL << 63)) { /\* valid PFN \*/
pfn &= ((1UL << 55) - 1); /\* clear flag bits \*/
pfn |= (1UL << 55);
lseek64(pageflags, pfn \* sizeof(uint64\_t), SEEK\_SET);
read(pageflags, &val, sizeof(val));
}
On ARM64 this causes the userspace process to crash with SIGSEGV rather
than reading (1 << KPF\_NOPAGE). kpageflags\_read() treats the offset as
valid, and stable\_page\_flags() will try to access an address between the
user and kernel address ranges.

arm64: Fix mismatched cache line size detection
commit 4c4a39dd5fe2d13e2d2fa5fceb8ef95d19fc389a upstream.
If there is a mismatch in the I/D min line size, we must
always use the system wide safe value both in applications
and in the kernel, while performing cache operations. However,
we have been checking more bits than just the min line sizes,
which triggers false negatives. We may need to trap the user
accesses in such cases, but not necessarily patch the kernel.
This patch fixes the check to do the right thing as advertised.
A new capability will be added to check mismatches in other
fields and ensure we trap the CTR accesses.

printk/nmi: Prevent deadlock when accessing the main log buffer in NMI
commit 03fc7f9c99c1e7ae2925d459e8487f1a6f199f79 upstream.
The commit 719f6a7040f1bdaf96 ("printk: Use the main logbuf in NMI
when logbuf\_lock is available") brought back the possible deadlocks
in printk() and NMI.
The check of logbuf\_lock is done only in printk\_nmi\_enter() to prevent
mixed output. But another CPU might take the lock later, enter NMI, and:
+ Both NMIs might be serialized by yet another lock, for example,
the one in nmi\_cpu\_backtrace().
+ The other CPU might get stopped in NMI, see smp\_send\_stop()
in panic().
The only safe solution is to use trylock when storing the message
into the main log-buffer. It might cause reordering when some lines
go to the main lock buffer directly and others are delayed via
the per-CPU buffer. It means that it is not useful in general.
This patch replaces the problematic NMI deferred context with NMI
direct context. It can be used to mark a code that might produce
many messages in NMI and the risk of losing them is more critical
than problems with eventual reordering.
The context is then used when dumping trace buffers on oops. It was
the primary motivation for the original fix. Also the reordering is
even smaller issue there because some traces have their own time stamps.
Finally, nmi\_cpu\_backtrace() need not longer be serialized because
it will always us the per-CPU buffers again.

iommu/arm-smmu: Error out only if not enough context interrupts
commit d1e20222d5372e951bbb2fd3f6489ec4a6ea9b11 upstream.
Currently we check if the number of context banks is not equal to
num\_context\_interrupts. However, there are booloaders such as, one
on sdm845 that reserves few context banks and thus kernel views
less than the total available context banks.
So, although the hardware definition in device tree would mention
the correct number of context interrupts, this number can be
greater than the number of context banks visible to smmu in kernel.
We should therefore error out only when the number of context banks
is greater than the available number of context interrupts.

regulator: arizona-ldo1: Use correct device to get enable GPIO

Currently the enable GPIO is being looked up on the regulator
device itself but that does not have its own DT node, this causes
the lookup to fail and the regulator not to get its GPIO. The DT
node is shared across the whole MFD and as such the lookup needs
to happen on that parent device. Moving the lookup to the parent
device also means devres can no longer be used as the life time
would attach to the wrong device.
Additionally, the enable GPIO is active high so we should be passing
GPIOD\_OUT\_LOW to ensure the regulator starts in its off state allowing
the driver to enable it when it is ready.

Btrfs: send, fix incorrect file layout after hole punching beyond eof
commit 22d3151c2c4cb517a309154d1e828a28106508c7 upstream.
When doing an incremental send, if we have a file in the parent snapshot
that has prealloc extents beyond EOF and in the send snapshot it got a
hole punch that partially covers the prealloc extents, the send stream,
when replayed by a receiver, can result in a file that has a size bigger
than it should and filled with zeroes past the correct EOF.
For example:
$ mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdb
$ mount /dev/sdb /mnt
$ xfs\_io -f -c "falloc -k 0 4M" /mnt/foobar
$ xfs\_io -c "pwrite -S 0xea 0 1M" /mnt/foobar
$ btrfs subvolume snapshot -r /mnt /mnt/snap1
$ btrfs send -f /tmp/1.send /mnt/snap1
$ xfs\_io -c "fpunch 1M 2M" /mnt/foobar
$ btrfs subvolume snapshot -r /mnt /mnt/snap2
$ btrfs send -f /tmp/2.send -p /mnt/snap1 /mnt/snap2
$ stat --format %s /mnt/snap2/foobar
1048576
$ md5sum /mnt/snap2/foobar
d31659e82e87798acd4669a1e0a19d4f /mnt/snap2/foobar
$ umount /mnt
$ mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdc
$ mount /dev/sdc /mnt
$ btrfs receive -f /mnt/1.snap /mnt
$ btrfs receive -f /mnt/2.snap /mnt
$ stat --format %s /mnt/snap2/foobar
3145728
# --> should be 1Mb and not 3Mb (which was the end offset of hole
# punch operation)
$ md5sum /mnt/snap2/foobar
117baf295297c2a995f92da725b0b651 /mnt/snap2/foobar
# --> should be d31659e82e87798acd4669a1e0a19d4f as in the original fs
This issue actually happens only since commit ffa7c4296e93 ("Btrfs: send,
do not issue unnecessary truncate operations"), but before that commit we
were issuing a write operation full of zeroes (to "punch" a hole) which
was extending the file size beyond the correct value and then immediately
issue a truncate operation to the correct size and undoing the previous
write operation. Since the send protocol does not support fallocate, for
extent preallocation and hole punching, fix this by not even attempting
to send a "hole" (regular write full of zeroes) if it starts at an offset
greater then or equals to the file's size. This approach, besides being
much more simple then making send issue the truncate operation, adds the
benefit of avoiding the useless pair of write of zeroes and truncate
operations, saving time and IO at the receiver and reducing the size of
the send stream.
A test case for fstests follows soon.

Btrfs: fix send failure when root has deleted files still open
commit 46b2f4590aab71d31088a265c86026b1e96c9de4 upstream.
The more common use case of send involves creating a RO snapshot and then
use it for a send operation. In this case it's not possible to have inodes
in the snapshot that have a link count of zero (inode with an orphan item)
since during snapshot creation we do the orphan cleanup. However, other
less common use cases for send can end up seeing inodes with a link count
of zero and in this case the send operation fails with a ENOENT error
because any attempt to generate a path for the inode, with the purpose
of creating it or updating it at the receiver, fails since there are no
inode reference items. One use case it to use a regular subvolume for
a send operation after turning it to RO mode or turning a RW snapshot
into RO mode and then using it for a send operation. In both cases, if a

descriptor before turning the subvolume/snapshot into RO mode, the send
operation will encounter an inode with a link count of zero and then
fail with errno ENOENT.
Example using a full send with a subvolume:
$ mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdb
$ mount /dev/sdb /mnt
$ btrfs subvolume create /mnt/sv1
$ touch /mnt/sv1/foo
$ touch /mnt/sv1/bar
# keep an open file descriptor on file bar
$ exec 73> /mnt/sv1/bar
$ btrfs subvolume snapshot -r /mnt/sv1 /mnt/snap2
# Turn the second snapshot to RW mode and delete file foo while
# holding an open file descriptor on it.
$ btrfs property set /mnt/snap2 ro false
$ exec 73

forever.
btrfs\_write\_inode() was originally added way back in 4730a4bc5bf3
("btrfs\_dirty\_inode") to support O\_SYNC writes. However, ->write\_inode()
hasn't been used for O\_SYNC since 148f948ba877 ("vfs: Introduce new
helpers for syncing after writing to O\_SYNC file or IS\_SYNC inode"), so
btrfs\_write\_inode() is actually unnecessary (and leads to a bunch of
unnecessary commits). Get rid of it, which also gets rid of the
deadlock.

Btrfs: fix mount failure after fsync due to hard link recreation
commit 0d836392cadd5535f4184d46d901a82eb276ed62 upstream.
If we end up with logging an inode reference item which has the same name
but different index from the one we have persisted, we end up failing when
replaying the log with an errno value of -EEXIST. The error comes from
btrfs\_add\_link(), which is called from add\_inode\_ref(), when we are
replaying an inode reference item.
Example scenario where this happens:
$ mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdb
$ mount /dev/sdb /mnt
$ touch /mnt/foo
$ ln /mnt/foo /mnt/bar
$ sync
# Rename the first hard link (foo) to a new name and rename the second
# hard link (bar) to the old name of the first hard link (foo).
$ mv /mnt/foo /mnt/qwerty
$ mv /mnt/bar /mnt/foo
# Create a new file, in the same parent directory, with the old name of
# the second hard link (bar) and fsync this new file.
# We do this instead of calling fsync on foo/qwerty because if we did
# that the fsync resulted in a full transaction commit, not triggering
# the problem.
$ touch /mnt/bar
$ xfs\_io -c "fsync" /mnt/bar
$ mount /dev/sdb /mnt
mount: mount /dev/sdb on /mnt failed: File exists
So fix this by checking if a conflicting inode reference exists (same
name, same parent but different index), removing it (and the associated
dir index entries from the parent inode) if it exists, before attempting
to add the new reference.
A test case for fstests follows soon.

commit e02789a53d71334b067ad72eee5d4e88a0158083 upstream.
When enumerating snapshots, the last few bytes of the final
snapshot could be left off since we were miscalculating the
length returned (leaving off the sizeof struct SRV\_SNAPSHOT\_ARRAY)
See MS-SMB2 section 2.2.32.2. In addition fixup the length used
to allow smaller buffer to be passed in, in order to allow
returning the size of the whole snapshot array more easily.
Sample userspace output with a kernel patched with this
(mounted to a Windows volume with two snapshots).
Before this patch, the second snapshot would be missing a
few bytes at the end.

xprtrdma: Fix disconnect regression
commit 8d4fb8ff427a23e573c9373b2bb3d1d6e8ea4399 upstream.
I found that injecting disconnects with v4.18-rc resulted in
random failures of the multi-threaded git regression test.
The root cause appears to be that, after a reconnect, the
RPC/RDMA transport is waking pending RPCs before the transport has
posted enough Receive buffers to receive the Replies. If a Reply
arrives before enough Receive buffers are posted, the connection
is dropped. A few connection drops happen in quick succession as
the client and server struggle to regain credit synchronization.
This regression was introduced with commit 7c8d9e7c8863 ("xprtrdma:
Move Receive posting to Receive handler"). The client is supposed to
post a single Receive when a connection is established because
it's not supposed to send more than one RPC Call before it gets
a fresh credit grant in the first RPC Reply [RFC 8166, Section
3.3.3].
Unfortunately there appears to be a longstanding bug in the Linux
client's credit accounting mechanism. On connect, it simply dumps
all pending RPC Calls onto the new connection. It's possible it has
done this ever since the RPC/RDMA transport was added to the kernel
ten years ago.
Servers have so far been tolerant of this bad behavior. Currently no
server implementation ever changes its credit grant over reconnects,
and servers always repost enough Receives before connections are
fully established.
The Linux client implementation used to post a Receive before each
of these Calls. This has covered up the flooding send behavior.
I could try to correct this old bug so that the client sends exactly
one RPC Call and waits for a Reply. Since we are so close to the
next merge window, I'm going to instead provide a simple patch to
post enough Receives before a reconnect completes (based on the
number of credits granted to the previous connection).
The spurious disconnects will be gone, but the client will still
send multiple RPC Calls immediately after a reconnect.
Addressing the latter problem will wait for a merge window because
a) I expect it to be a large change requiring lots of testing, and
b) obviously the Linux client has interoperated successfully since
day zero while still being broken.

scsi: libsas: dynamically allocate and free ata host
commit 2fa4a32613c9182b00e46872755b0662374424a7 upstream.
Commit 2623c7a5f2 ("libata: add refcounting to ata\_host") v4.17+ introduced
refcounting to ata\_host and will increase or decrease the refcount when
adding or deleting transport ATA port.
Now the ata host for libsas is embedded in domain\_device, and the ->kref
member is not initialized. Afer we add ata transport class, ata\_host\_get()
will be called when adding transport ATA port and a warning will be
triggered as below:
refcount\_t: increment on 0; use-after-free.
WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 103 at
lib/refcount.c:153 refcount\_inc+0x40/0x48 ...... Call trace:
refcount\_inc+0x40/0x48
ata\_host\_get+0x10/0x18
ata\_tport\_add+0x40/0x120

process\_one\_work+0x12c/0x288
worker\_thread+0x58/0x3f0
kthread+0xfc/0x128
ret\_from\_fork+0x10/0x18
And also when removing transport ATA port ata\_host\_put() will be called and
another similar warning will be triggered. If the refcount decreased to
zero, the ata host will be freed. But this ata host is only part of
domain\_device, it cannot be freed directly.
So we have to change this embedded static ata host to a dynamically
allocated ata host and initialize the ->kref member. To use ata\_host\_get()
and ata\_host\_put() in libsas, we need to move the declaration of these
functions to the public libata.h and export them.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-azure](/security/cves?package=linux-azure) - Linux kernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems
* [linux-gcp](/security/cves?package=linux-gcp) - Linux kernel for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) systems
* [linux-hwe](/security/cves?package=linux-hwe) - Linux hardware enablement (HWE) kernel

## Details

USN-3820-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 18.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS for Ubuntu

16.04 LTS.

Felix Wilhelm discovered that the Xen netback driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly perform input validation in some situations. An attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-15471](/security/CVE-2018-15471))

It was discovered that the generic SCSI driver in the Linux kernel did not

properly enforce permissions on kernel memory access. A local attacker

could use this to expose sensitive information or possibly elevate

privileges. ([CVE-2017-13168](/security/CVE-2017-13168))

It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the CD-ROM driver of

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-16658](/security/CVE-2018-16658))

It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the HID Bluetooth

implementation in the Linux kernel that could lead to a buffer overwrite.

An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-9363](/security/CVE-2018-9363))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-39-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-39.42~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-39.42~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-39-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-39.42~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-39.42~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-39-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-39.42~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-39.42~16.04.1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-3797-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu

14.04 LTS.

Noam Rathaus discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

Infiniband implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-14734](/security/CVE-2018-14734))

It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the CD-ROM driver of

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-16658](/security/CVE-2018-16658))

It was discovered that a integer overflow existed in the HID Bluetooth

implementation in the Linux kernel that could lead to a buffer overwrite.

An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-9363](/security/CVE-2018-9363))

Yves Younan discovered that the CIPSO labeling implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle IP header options in some situations. A

remote attacker could use this to specially craft network traffic that

could cause a denial of service (infinite loop). ([CVE-2018-10938](/security/CVE-2018-10938))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# USN-3822-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

14 November 2018

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Jim Mattson discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel

mismanages the #BP and #OF exceptions. A local attacker in a guest virtual

machine could use this to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash).

([CVE-2016-9588](/security/CVE-2016-9588))

It was discovered that the generic SCSI driver in the Linux kernel did not

properly enforce permissions on kernel memory access. A local attacker

could use this to expose sensitive information or possibly elevate

privileges. ([CVE-2017-13168](/security/CVE-2017-13168))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the CDC USB Ethernet driver did not

properly validate device descriptors. A physically proximate attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-16649](/security/CVE-2017-16649))

It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the CD-ROM driver of

the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-16658](/security/CVE-2018-16658))

It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the HID Bluetooth

implementation in the Linux kernel that could lead to a buffer overwrite.

An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-9363](/security/CVE-2018-9363))

  -
  [3.13.0-162.212](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.13.0-162.212)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
