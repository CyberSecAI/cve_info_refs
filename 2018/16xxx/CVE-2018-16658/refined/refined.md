  "CVE-2018-16658": {
    "description": "Information leak in cdrom_ioctl_drive_status",
    "root_cause": "The cdrom driver does not correctly validate the parameter to the CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS ioctl. A cast from unsigned long to int causes a bounds check to fail when processing specially crafted input.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Information Leak",
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "A local user with access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service (crash).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local"
     ],
     "required_capabilities": [
       "Access to a cdrom device"
     ],
     "additional_information": "The flaw is located in `drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c` in the `cdrom_ioctl_drive_status()` function, which is used to handle the `CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS` ioctl. Specifically, the code casts a user-controlled `unsigned long` to an `int` and uses the result to index an array, without proper validation."
