- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `keyword` parameter of various pages that use `Model_index.php`, leading to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the application's pages. This code could then be executed in the victim's browser, allowing the attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through crafted URLs containing malicious JavaScript within the `keyword` parameter. The user is tricked into visiting the crafted URL, which executes the injected script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs and persuade users to visit them. No special privileges or access to the server are required.
