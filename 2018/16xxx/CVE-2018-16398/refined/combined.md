## Description

[![@sohu0106](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16274106?v=4&size=48)](/sohu0106)[sohu0106](https://github.com/sohu0106)opened [on Jul 16, 2018](https://github.com/twistlock/authz/issues/50#issue-341498309)

Regular expressions used by Authz are relatively simple and may be bypassed

For example, we allow only the docker start in the policy, and docker pause is not allowed.

Normal access to <https://127.0.0.1:2376/v1.23/containers/aa/pause> will be rejected

But we can be accessed the url

[Https://127.0.0.1:2376/v1.23/containers/aa/pause?aaa=\/start](https://127.0.0.1:2376/v1.23/containers/aa/pause?aaa=%5C/start)

to bypass Authz’s policy restrictions

The above regular expression can bypass the Authz limit and run docker pause success
