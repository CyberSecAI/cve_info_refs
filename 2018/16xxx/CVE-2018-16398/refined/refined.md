The provided content relates to CVE-2018-16398.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of the URI path component before checking it against regular expressions. The application uses regular expressions to enforce policies, for example, allowing `docker start` but not `docker pause`. However, the application does not properly parse and sanitize the URI, allowing for policy bypass.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input sanitization of the URI path component
- Reliance on simple regular expressions for policy enforcement
- Lack of proper URI parsing

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can bypass policy restrictions enforced by Authz. For example, a policy might allow `docker start` but not `docker pause`. By crafting a URL with a query parameter like `https://127.0.0.1:2376/v1.23/containers/aa/pause?aaa=\/start`, the attacker can successfully execute the restricted `docker pause` command by bypassing the Authz policy enforcement.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted URLs with query parameters

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Authz protected service.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the policy being enforced.
- The attacker needs the ability to craft URLs including query parameters to bypass policy.
