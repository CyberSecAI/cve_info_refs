Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-16705:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Furuno Felcom250 and Felcom500 devices allowing unauthenticated access to an XML file containing sensitive system information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Password Disclosure:** The core issue is the exposure of usernames and passwords, including the Admin and Service accounts, within an accessible XML file.
- **Insecure Password Storage:** The system stores user passwords as unsalted MD5 hashes. Additionally, the SMS server password is stored in cleartext.
- **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerability allows unauthenticated access to the XML file, meaning no login or authorization is required to access it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full System Compromise:**  Access to administrator-level credentials enables attackers to fully compromise the affected Furuno devices.
- **Data Exposure:**  The exposure of usernames and passwords allows attackers to access other associated systems or services.
- **Device Manipulation:** Attackers could modify configurations, disrupt services, and/or gain control of the devices.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the vulnerable device to retrieve the XML configuration file. This could be from the local network or, in some cases, via the internet if the device is exposed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the affected Furuno device. This does not require prior authentication.
- **Basic Web Request Knowledge:** The attacker needs to make a simple web request to retrieve the XML file.

**Additional details:**
