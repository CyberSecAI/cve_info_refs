{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it in the title bar of the system.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the title bar of the UCMS system.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities such as stealing cookies, session information, redirecting users to malicious sites or performing actions on behalf of the user.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code by editing the title of a category in the UCMS backend. The crafted title containing the malicious script is then displayed on the title bar, leading to XSS when a user visits the affected pages.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to have an account with administrative or editing privileges to be able to edit categories and inject the malicious code. They also need to be able to access the backend of the UCMS system."
