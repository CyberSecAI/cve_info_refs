## Vulnerability Name:

UCMS has cross site scripting attack (XSS) in the title bar of all systems.

## Vulnerability version number:

UCMS v1.4.6

## Vulnerability:

high risk

## Vulnerability Description:

Without checking the data contained in the dynamic content, it is transmitted to the Web user. Malicious content delivered to a Web browser usually takes the form of a JavaScript snippet, but may also contain some HTML, Flash, or any other code that can be executed by the browser, such as private data (such as cookies or other session information) that is transmitted to an attacker. Under the control of the attacker, guide the victim into malicious network content; or use vulnerable sites for other malicious operations on the user's machine.
