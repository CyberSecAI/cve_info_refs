CVE-2018-16057
```
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-16057:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the Radiotap dissector within Wireshark. Specifically, the issue is related to how iterator operations are handled during the dissection of Radiotap headers. An improper validation of iterator operations during parsing can lead to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of proper validation of iterator operations within the `epan/dissectors/packet-ieee80211-radiotap-iter.c` file. This allows the dissector to attempt access to memory outside of the valid bounds during iteration which can cause crashes due to buffer over-read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** A successful exploit could lead to a crash of the Wireshark application. This is achieved by providing a malformed packet that triggers the vulnerability within the Radiotap dissector, leading to an application crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Injection:** An attacker could inject a malformed packet onto a network that is being monitored by Wireshark, triggering the crash.
*   **Malicious Packet Trace Files:** An attacker could create a malformed packet trace file. By tricking someone into opening such a file, an attacker could cause a crash to the user's instance of Wireshark.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to inject malformed packets onto the network being monitored.
*  **User Interaction:** In the case of using malformed packet trace files, an attacker needs to convince a user to open a malicious packet capture.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 2.6.0 to 2.6.2, 2.4.0 to 2.4.8, and 2.2.0 to 2.2.16.
*   The fix involves changes to the source code to properly validate the iterator operations.
*   SUSE rates the severity as "important" with a CVSS v3 score of 7.1 (SUSE rating), but the base score of 7.5 is provided by NVD.

This information suggests that a remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service (application crash) by exploiting a flaw in the Radiotap dissector in Wireshark through the injection of a specifically crafted packet. User interaction is not required in the case of network injection, but is required when a malformed pcap file is used.
