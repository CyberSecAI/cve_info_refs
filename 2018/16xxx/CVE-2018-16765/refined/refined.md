{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A heap-buffer-overflow occurs during the parsing of a WebAssembly (Wasm) file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap-buffer-overflow due to improper handling of IR::NoImm during the parsing of WASM file.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability can cause a crash in the WAVM runtime environment due to memory corruption.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves providing a malicious crafted WASM file to the WAVM runtime environment.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to provide a specially crafted WASM file that triggers the heap-buffer-overflow during parsing of IR::NoImm."
