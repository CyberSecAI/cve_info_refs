Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2018-16393:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary cause is a buffer overflow vulnerability within the `gemsafe_get_cert_len()` function located in `src/libopensc/pkcs15-gemsafeV1.c`. This function processes responses from GemSafe V1 smartcards, and if a card returns more key container data than expected, the function writes beyond allocated memory for `gemsafe_prkeys` and `gemsafe_cert` arrays.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Write:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write, where the code writes data beyond the allocated size of the `gemsafe_prkeys` and `gemsafe_cert` arrays.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code fails to validate the length of the data received from the smart card against the buffer's capacity before copying it into the memory.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition, which would cause the application to crash due to the memory corruption.
*   **Unspecified Other Impact:** There is also a possibility of "unspecified other impact", which suggests that exploitation of the vulnerability could have consequences beyond DoS, potentially including arbitrary code execution depending on the specific memory layout.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Smartcards:** The attack vector involves an attacker providing a crafted GemSafe V1 smartcard with malicious responses to APDU commands. The malicious response would contain a large number of key container entries causing the `gemsafe_get_cert_len()` to write beyond the buffer bounds.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to a system using the vulnerable OpenSC library.
*   **Crafted Smartcard:** They must have the capability to create or modify a GemSafe V1 smartcard to provide a malicious response to the application.
