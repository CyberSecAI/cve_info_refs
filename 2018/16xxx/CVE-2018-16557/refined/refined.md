- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper verification of cryptographic signature in specially crafted packets sent to port 102/tcp.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of cryptographic signatures of incoming packets. This can be exploited by sending crafted packets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition, potentially requiring a firmware re-flash to recover the CPU. This could halt the core functions of the CPU and impact system availability.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending malicious packets to port 102/tcp via Ethernet, PROFIBUS, or Multi Point Interfaces (MPI).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have network access to port 102/tcp or the capability to send messages through PROFIBUS or MPI. No user interaction is required and no privileges are necessary if access protection is not enabled.
