The provided content discusses CVE-2018-16254 to CVE-2018-16259, a range of XSS vulnerabilities in the "Import any XML or CSV File" WordPress plugin (also known as WP All Import). This content does not relate to CVE-2018-16255 specifically, but to a range of CVEs that includes it.

Based on the provided information, here are the details:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input when importing XML or CSV files via the plugin. Specifically, the comment section mentions that the vulnerable parameters are "custom\_type" and "large\_feed\_limit".

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code, which would be executed in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to various impacts, such as session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:** The attacker would need to import a crafted XML or CSV file containing malicious code through the vulnerable plugin's import function. The comment section indicates that the vulnerable parameters are passed via a POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in administrator to access the vulnerable import functionality of the plugin and inject the malicious code.

**Additional notes:**
- The blog post mentions that the POC for these vulnerabilities will be disclosed once the developer has fixed the issue.
- A comment from the plugin developer suggests that the vulnerabilities can only be exploited intentionally by a logged-in administrator, and that they do not consider it to be a security issue that needs fixing.
