The provided content is related to CVE-2018-16145.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists due to a script, `/etc/init.d/opsview-reporting-module`, invoking `/opt/opsview/jasper/bin/db_jasper` before dropping root privileges. The `db_jasper` script is writable by the `opsview` group which the `nagios` user belongs to.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper privilege management:** The script `/etc/init.d/opsview-reporting-module` executes `/opt/opsview/jasper/bin/db_jasper` as root, and this script is writeable by the nagios user and is executed as root without proper sanitization.
- **Insecure file permissions:** The `db_jasper` script is writable by the `opsview` group, to which the `nagios` user belongs. This allows an attacker with nagios user privileges to modify the script.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker with nagios user privileges can modify the `db_jasper` script to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges upon system reboot. This leads to complete compromise of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local exploitation:** An attacker must first gain access to the system as the nagios user.
- **Script modification:** The attacker needs to modify the `/opt/opsview/jasper/bin/db_jasper` script.
- **System reboot:** The malicious code will only execute when the system is rebooted and the `/etc/init.d/opsview-reporting-module` script is executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have shell access to the system as the nagios user.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to modify the file `/opt/opsview/jasper/bin/db_jasper`.
