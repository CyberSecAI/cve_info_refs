{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient access controls on the printer's file system combined with the ability to send PJL (Printer Job Language) commands over the network.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Insecure default password settings on printers",
    "Lack of access control on the printer's file system",
    "Ability to write and upload files to the printer via PJL",
    "Ability to read files and directory listings from the printer via PJL",
    "Use of predictable passwords"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote command execution on the printer which could potentially lead to a compromise of the device and/or network.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending specially crafted PJL commands over the network to the printer's port 9100.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the printer and must be able to send raw TCP data to port 9100."
