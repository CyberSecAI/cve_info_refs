  "CVE-2018-16471": {
    "description": "A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Rack versions before 2.0.6 and 1.6.11. Crafted requests can impact the data returned by the `scheme` method on `Rack::Request`. Applications that expect the scheme to be limited to 'http' or 'https' and do not escape the return value could be vulnerable to an XSS attack.",
    "affected_component": "ruby-rack",
    "root_cause": "The `scheme` method on `Rack::Request` does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing a crafted request to inject arbitrary schemes that, if not properly escaped by the application, can lead to XSS.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to inject malicious scripts into web applications leading to information disclosure, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "A remote attacker can send a crafted HTTP request with a malicious scheme (e.g., `javascript:alert(1)`) in the URL, which would be returned by the `scheme` method.",
      "The malicious scheme is reflected in the web application's response. If not sanitized, the browser executes the malicious script.",
       "The vulnerability arises in applications that use the Rack `scheme` method and do not properly escape its output."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required.",
     "additional_details": [
      "The vulnerability is in the Rack library, which is a web server interface for Ruby.",
      "Applications that rely on the `scheme` method of Rack::Request to return only 'http' or 'https' and do not properly escape its output are vulnerable.",
       "Applications that use standard escaping mechanisms provided by frameworks like Rails might not be vulnerable.",
      "The fix involves whitelisting the `http` and `https` schemes in the `Rack::Request` `scheme` method."
