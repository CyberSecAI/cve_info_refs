# Re: System Down: A systemd-journald exploit

---

*From*: Qualys Security Advisory <qsa () qualys com>

*Date*: Mon, 13 May 2019 07:24:20 -0700

```
Hi all,

Our systemd-journald exploit for CVE-2018-16865 and CVE-2018-16866 is
now available at:

<https://www.qualys.com/2019/05/09/system-down/system-down.tar.gz>

It is also attached to this email. A few notes about this exploit:

- It supports several targets by default (vulnerable versions of Debian,
  Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS), and it should be relatively easy to add more
  targets.

- When adding a new amd64 target, use the "free_hook" method if possible
  (if located at a multiple of 16 plus 8, as explained in our advisory);
  for various reasons, the alternative "stderr_chain" method is not as
  reliable as "free_hook" and may therefore take longer to succeed.

- When adding and testing a new target, you may want to set
  "StartLimitInterval=1s" and "StartLimitBurst=10" (for example) in
  "systemd-journald.service": the exploit will detect this and
  brute-force faster.

- If the exploit dies because "No journal files were opened due to
  insufficient permissions", the "wall" method can be used instead (via
  the "-w" switch). Our exploit currently implements the wall method
  "ssh 127.0.0.1", but alternative methods can be implemented
  ("utempter" and "gnome-pty-helper", for example).

- To test the default information-leak method even if "No journal files
  were opened due to insufficient permissions", it is enough to create
  /var/log/journal/ (as explained in "man systemd-journald").

Thank you very much! With best regards,

--

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1651257#c0)  David Tardon    2018-11-19 14:41:10 UTC  ``` Description of problem: If an expiration time is set for an automount unit, an access to the automounted dir after it expired will hang if 'systemd daemon-reload' was run meanwhile.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): systemd-219.57.el7  How reproducible: always  Steps to Reproduce: # Setup 1. mkdir /etc/systemd/system/proc-sys-fs-binfmt_misc.automount.d 2. echo -e "[Automount]\nTimeoutIdleSec=5s" > /etc/systemd/system/proc-sys-fs-binfmt_misc.automount.d/timeout.conf # set up expiration time 3. systemctl daemon-reload # load the new config 4. systemctl restart proc-sys-fs-binfmt_misc.automount # optional, just to be sure 5. ls /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc # trigger the automount 6. sleep 5 # now let it expire 7. systemctl daemon-reload # trigger the bug 8. ls /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc # hang  Actual results: ls hangs.  Expected results: ls shows the content of the dir.  Additional info: This is a regression in systemd-219-59 (7.5), caused by patch 0561-automount-if-an-automount-unit-is-masked-don-t-react.patch .  The bug can manifest itself during update from 7.3 to 7.5/7.6 (but not from 7.4 to 7.5), because systemd-219-30 in 7.3 hardcodes expiration timeout to 5min (expiration is disabled by default from 7.4 up). However, systemd-219-30 doesn't actually handle expiration. That was only fixed in systemd-219-42 in 7.4. And there is a lot of daemon-reloads run during the update.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1651257#c2)  David Tardon    2018-11-19 15:34:18 UTC  ``` <https://github.com/lnykryn/systemd-rhel/pull/243>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1651257#c3)  kevin    2018-11-21 02:37:30 UTC  ``` hello,  what about 7.2? my issue happened in 7.2 with 'systemd-219-19.el7.x86_64' installed. I also did the steps to reproduce, but it didnt work on 7.2.  additional info: systemd-1 on /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc type autofs (rw,relatime,fd=29,pgrp=1,timeout=300,minproto=5,maxproto=5,direct)  Thanks!   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1651257#c4)  David Tardon    2018-11-21 08:59:10 UTC  ``` (In reply to kevin from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1651257#c3)) > hello,  > what about 7.2? my issue happened in 7.2 with 'systemd-219-19.el7.x86_64' > installed. I also did the steps to reproduce, but it didnt work on 7.2.  systemd didn't even handle automount expiration before 7.4. And the patch that causes this bug was added in 7.5. So whatever problem you have, it's something different than this.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1651257#c6)  Lukáš Nykrýn    2019-02-11 09:43:25 UTC  ``` fix merged to staging branch -> <https://github.com/lnykryn/systemd-rhel/pull/243> -> post   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1651257#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-06 12:43:36 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Debian Bug     : 918841 918848

The Qualys Research Labs discovered multiple vulnerabilities in
systemd-journald. Two memory corruption flaws, via attacker-controlled
alloca()s (CVE-2018-16864, CVE-2018-16865) and an out-of-bounds read flaw
leading to an information leak (CVE-2018-16866), could allow an attacker to
cause a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code.

Further details in the Qualys Security Advisory at
<https://www.qualys.com/2019/01/09/system-down/system-down.txt>

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 232-25+deb9u7.

We recommend that you upgrade your systemd packages.

For the detailed security status of systemd please refer to its security
tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/systemd>

# Re: System Down: A systemd-journald exploit

---

*From*: Qualys Security Advisory <qsa () qualys com>

*Date*: Mon, 13 May 2019 07:27:45 -0700

---

```
Hi all,

Our systemd-journald exploit for CVE-2018-16865 and CVE-2018-16866 is
now available at:

<https://www.qualys.com/2019/05/09/system-down/system-down.tar.gz>

It is also attached to this email. A few notes about this exploit:

- It supports several targets by default (vulnerable versions of Debian,
  Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS), and it should be relatively easy to add more
  targets.

- When adding a new amd64 target, use the "free_hook" method if possible
  (if located at a multiple of 16 plus 8, as explained in our advisory);
  for various reasons, the alternative "stderr_chain" method is not as
  reliable as "free_hook" and may therefore take longer to succeed.

- When adding and testing a new target, you may want to set
  "StartLimitInterval=1s" and "StartLimitBurst=10" (for example) in
  "systemd-journald.service": the exploit will detect this and
  brute-force faster.

- If the exploit dies because "No journal files were opened due to
  insufficient permissions", the "wall" method can be used instead (via
  the "-w" switch). Our exploit currently implements the wall method
  "ssh 127.0.0.1", but alternative methods can be implemented
  ("utempter" and "gnome-pty-helper", for example).

- To test the default information-leak method even if "No journal files
  were opened due to insufficient permissions", it is enough to create
  /var/log/journal/ (as explained in "man systemd-journald").

Thank you very much! With best regards,

--
the Qualys Security Advisory team

# USN-3855-1: systemd vulnerabilities

11 January 2019

Several security issues were fixed in systemd.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [systemd](/security/cves?package=systemd) - system and service manager

## Details

It was discovered that systemd-journald allocated variable-length buffers

for certain message fields on the stack. A local attacker could

potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service, or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-16864](/security/CVE-2018-16864))

It was discovered that systemd-journald allocated variable-length arrays

of objects representing message fields on the stack. A local attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service, or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-16865](/security/CVE-2018-16865))

An out-of-bounds read was discovered in systemd-journald. A local

attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information

and bypass ASLR protections. ([CVE-2018-16866](/security/CVE-2018-16866))

Message-ID: <20190510104242.GA19388@localhost.localdomain>
Date: Fri, 10 May 2019 03:42:42 -0700
From: Qualys Security Advisory <qsa@...lys.com>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: Re: System Down: A systemd-journald exploit

Hi all,

Our systemd-journald exploit for CVE-2018-16865 and CVE-2018-16866 is
now available at:

<https://www.qualys.com/2019/05/09/system-down/system-down.tar.gz>

It is also attached to this email. A few notes about this exploit:

- It supports several targets by default (vulnerable versions of Debian,
  Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS), and it should be relatively easy to add more
  targets.

- When adding a new amd64 target, use the "free_hook" method if possible
  (if located at a multiple of 16 plus 8, as explained in our advisory);
  for various reasons, the alternative "stderr_chain" method is not as
  reliable as "free_hook" and may therefore take longer to succeed.

- When adding and testing a new target, you may want to set
  "StartLimitInterval=1s" and "StartLimitBurst=10" (for example) in
  "systemd-journald.service": the exploit will detect this and
  brute-force faster.

- If the exploit dies because "No journal files were opened due to
  insufficient permissions", the "wall" method can be used instead (via
  the "-w" switch). Our exploit currently implements the wall method
  "ssh 127.0.0.1", but alternative methods can be implemented
  ("utempter" and "gnome-pty-helper", for example).

- To test the default information-leak method even if "No journal files
  were opened due to insufficient permissions", it is enough to create
  /var/log/journal/ (as explained in "man systemd-journald").

Thank you very much! With best regards,

--
the Qualys Security Advisory team

# RHSA-2019:2091 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: systemd security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2019%3A2091)

## Topic

An update for systemd is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The systemd packages contain systemd, a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with the SysV and LSB init scripts. It provides aggressive parallelism capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, and keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups. In addition, it supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can also work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit.

Security Fix(es):

* systemd: line splitting via fgets() allows for state injection during daemon-reexec (CVE-2018-15686)
* systemd: out-of-bounds read when parsing a crafted syslog message (CVE-2018-16866)
* systemd: kills privileged process if unprivileged PIDFile was tampered (CVE-2018-16888)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Additional Changes:

For detailed information on changes in this release, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.7 Release Notes linked from the References section.

# RHSA-2020:0593 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: systemd security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2020%3A0593)

## Topic

An update for systemd is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Advanced Update Support, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Telco Extended Update Support, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Update Services for SAP Solutions.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The systemd packages contain systemd, a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with the SysV and LSB init scripts. It provides aggressive parallelism capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, and keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups. In addition, it supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can also work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit.

Security Fix(es):

* systemd: line splitting via fgets() allows for state injection during daemon-reexec (CVE-2018-15686)
* systemd: out-of-bounds read when parsing a crafted syslog message (CVE-2018-16866)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

# RHSA-2019:3222 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: systemd security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2019%3A3222)

## Topic

An update for systemd is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The systemd packages contain systemd, a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with the SysV and LSB init scripts. It provides aggressive parallelism capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, and keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups. In addition, it supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can also work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit.

Security Fix(es):

* systemd: line splitting via fgets() allows for state injection during daemon-reexec (CVE-2018-15686)
* systemd: out-of-bounds read when parsing a crafted syslog message (CVE-2018-16866)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Bug Fix(es):

* Layered slices are left in a "dead" state if slices are stopped that have child slices underneath (BZ#1729227)

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

-- System of a Down, "Toxicity"
========================================================================
Summary
========================================================================
We discovered three vulnerabilities in systemd-journald
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd):
- CVE-2018-16864 and CVE-2018-16865, two memory corruptions
(attacker-controlled alloca()s);
- CVE-2018-16866, an information leak (an out-of-bounds read).
CVE-2018-16864 was introduced in April 2013 (systemd v203) and became
exploitable in February 2016 (systemd v230). We developed a proof of
concept for CVE-2018-16864 that gains eip control on i386.
CVE-2018-16865 was introduced in December 2011 (systemd v38) and became
exploitable in April 2013 (systemd v201). CVE-2018-16866 was introduced
in June 2015 (systemd v221) and was inadvertently fixed in August 2018.
We developed an exploit for CVE-2018-16865 and CVE-2018-16866 that
obtains a local root shell in 10 minutes on i386 and 70 minutes on
amd64, on average. We will publish our exploit in the near future.
To the best of our knowledge, all systemd-based Linux distributions are
vulnerable, but SUSE Linux Enterprise 15, openSUSE Leap 15.0, and Fedora
28 and 29 are not exploitable because their user space is compiled with
GCC's -fstack-clash-protection.
This confirms https://grsecurity.net/an\_ancient\_kernel\_hole\_is\_not\_closed.php:
"It should be clear that kernel-only attempts to solve [the Stack Clash]
will necessarily always be incomplete, as the real issue lies in the
lack of stack probing."

Can you break out?
-- System of a Down, "36"
CVE-2018-16864 is similar to a Stack Clash vulnerability
(https://www.qualys.com/2017/06/19/stack-clash/stack-clash.txt), but:
- Steps 1 (Clash the stack with another memory region) and 2 (Run the
stack pointer to the start of the stack) are not needed, because the
attacker-controlled alloca() can be very large (several megabytes of
command-line arguments); only Steps 3 (Jump over the stack guard page,
into another memory region) and 4 (Smash the stack, or another memory
region) are needed.
- In Step 4 (Smash), the alloca() is fully written to (the vulnerability
is essentially a stpcpy(alloca(strlen(cmdline) + 1), cmdline)), and
the stpcpy() (a "wild copy") will therefore always crash into a
read-only or unmapped memory region:
https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/03/taming-wild-copy-parallel-thread.html
https://cansecwest.com/slides/2015/Taming%20wild%20copies%20-%20Chris%20evans.pdf
We tried to asynchronously interrupt this stpcpy() before it crashes,
with a signal or a timer, but we failed because journald uses signalfd()
and timerfd\_create() to handle these events synchronously.
We eventually gained control of eip (i386's instruction pointer) by
jumping into and smashing the stack of a concurrent thread (a "Parallel
Thread Corruption"):
- First, we send a large, high-priority message (LOG\_CRIT or higher) to
journald, from a process whose cmdline is small; this message forces a
large write() (between 1MB and 2MB) to /var/log/journal/ and forces
the creation of a short-lived thread that fsync()s the journal (the
stack of this thread is allocated in the mmap region).
- Next, we create several processes (between 32 and 64) that write() and
fsync() large files (between 1MB and 8MB) to /var/tmp/ (for example);
these processes stall journald's fsync() thread and will allow us to
win a tight race: exploit the "wild copy" before it crashes.
- Last, we send a small, low-priority message to journald, from a
process whose cmdline is very large (roughly 128MB, the distance
between the main stack and the mmap region); this message forces a
very large alloca() that jumps from journald's main stack into the
stack of the fsync() thread, and smashes a saved eip before fsync()
returns from kernel space.
On a Debian stable (9.5), our proof of concept wins this race and gains
eip control after a dozen tries (systemd automatically restarts journald
after each crash):
systemd-journal[2195]: segfault at 41414141 ip 41414141 sp b5f3d22c error 14
Despite this initial success, we abandoned the exploitation of
CVE-2018-16864: while working on our proof of concept, we discovered two
different vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-16865, another attacker-controlled
alloca(), and CVE-2018-16866, an information leak) that are reliably
exploitable on both i386 and amd64.

CVE-2018-16865
========================================================================

Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can you feel their haunting presence?
-- System of a Down, "Holy Mountains"
Surprised by the heavy usage of alloca() in journald, we searched for
another attacker-controlled alloca() and found CVE-2018-16865:
1963 int journal\_file\_append\_entry(JournalFile \*f, const dual\_timestamp \*ts, const struct iovec iovec[], unsigned n\_iovec, uint64\_t \*seqnum, Object \*\*ret, uint64\_t \*offset) {
....
1986 items = alloca(sizeof(EntryItem) \* MAX(1u, n\_iovec));
1987
1988 for (i = 0; i < n\_iovec; i++) {
1989 uint64\_t p;
1990 Object \*o;
1991
1992 r = journal\_file\_append\_data(f, iovec[i].iov\_base, iovec[i].iov\_len, &o, &p);
1993 if (r < 0)
1994 return r;
1995
1996 xor\_hash ^= le64toh(o->data.hash);
1997 items[i].object\_offset = htole64(p);
1998 items[i].hash = o->data.hash;
1999 }
This vulnerability was introduced in systemd v38:
commit cf244689e9d1ab50082c9ddd0f3c4d1eb982badc
Date: Thu Dec 29 15:00:57 2011 +0100
...
- items = new(EntryItem, n\_iovec);
- if (!items)
- return -ENOMEM;
+ items = alloca(sizeof(EntryItem) \* n\_iovec);
and became exploitable in systemd v201:
commit c4aa09b06f835c91cea9e021df4c3605cff2318d
Date: Mon Apr 8 20:32:03 2013 +0200
...
-#define ENTRY\_SIZE\_MAX (1024\*1024\*64)
-#define DATA\_SIZE\_MAX (1024\*1024\*64)
...
+#define ENTRY\_SIZE\_MAX (1024\*1024\*768)
+#define DATA\_SIZE\_MAX (1024\*1024\*768)
If we send a large "native" message to /run/systemd/journal/socket:
since the maximum size of a "native" entry is 768MB, and the minimum
length of a "native" item is 3 ("A=\n"), and the size of an EntryItem
structure is 16 (a 64-bit offset and a 64-bit hash), the maximum size of
the attacker-controlled alloca() in journal\_file\_append\_entry() is 768MB
/ 3 \* 16 = 4GB, large enough to jump from journald's main stack into the
mmap region, even on amd64.
On amd64, as described in the "64-bit exploitation" of our Stack Clash
advisory, the randomized distance between the main stack and the mmap
region is shorter than 4GB with a probability of (approximately):
SUM(d = 0; d < 4GB; d++) d / (16GB \* 1TB) ~= 1 / 2048
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exploitation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jump (pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo)
-- System of a Down, "Bounce"
CVE-2018-16865 is basically a simplified Stack Clash vulnerability:
- Steps 1 (Clash) and 2 (Run) of the Stack Clash are not needed, since
the largest attacker-controlled alloca() is 4GB; only Steps 3 (Jump)
and 4 (Smash) are needed.
- In Step 4 (Smash), the alloca() is not necessarily fully written to:
if the size of an item is larger than 128MB (DEFAULT\_MAX\_SIZE\_UPPER),
then journal\_file\_append\_data() returns an error that breaks the "for"
loop in journal\_file\_append\_entry() (at lines 1992-1994) and avoids a
crash into a read-only or unmapped memory region.
We eventually transformed this vulnerability into a crude
"write-what-where" (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/123.html):
- "write-where": We jump into and smash libc's read-write segment, and
thereby overwrite a function pointer. Unfortunately this "write-where"
is not surgical: the stack frames of the functions called from within
the "for" loop (in journal\_file\_append\_entry()) smash a few kilobytes
below our target function pointer, and therefore overwrite vital libc
variables that may crash or deadlock journald. Consequently, we must
sometimes shift our alloca() jump slightly, to avoid overwriting such
vital variables.
- "write-what": We want to overwrite our target function pointer with
the address of another function or ROP chain, but unfortunately the
stack frames of the functions called from within the "for" loop (in
journal\_file\_append\_entry()) do not contain any data that we control.
However, the 64-bit "hash" values that are written to the alloca()ted
"items" are produced by jenkins\_hashlittle2(), a noncryptographic hash
function: we can easily find a short string (a preimage) that hashes
to a given value (the address that will overwrite our target function
pointer) and is also a valid\_user\_field() (or journal\_field\_valid()).
This "write-what" restricts our "write-where" to function pointers
whose address modulo 16 is equal to 8 (the offset of "hash" in the
EntryItem structure).
To complete our exploit, we need the address of journald's stack pointer
before the alloca() jump, and the address of our target function pointer
in libc's read-write segment -- we need an information leak.

CVE-2018-16866
========================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------------
When they speak, we can peek from the windows of their mouths
-- System of a Down, "Know"
We discovered an out-of-bounds read in journald (CVE-2018-16866), and
transformed it into an information leak:
31 #define WHITESPACE " \t\n\r"
...
194 size\_t syslog\_parse\_identifier(const char \*\*buf, char \*\*identifier, char \*\*pid) {
195 const char \*p;
...
197 size\_t l, e;
...
203 p = \*buf;
204
205 p += strspn(p, WHITESPACE);
206 l = strcspn(p, WHITESPACE);
207
208 if (l <= 0 ||
209 p[l-1] != ':')
210 return 0;
211
212 e = l;
...
240 if (strchr(WHITESPACE, p[e]))
241 e++;
242 \*buf = p + e;
243 return e;
244 }
If we send a syslog message to journald (in \*buf), and if the last
character of this message is a ':' (before the '\0' terminator), then:
- at line 240, p[e] is the '\0' terminator of our message;
- at line 240, strchr(WHITESPACE, p[e]) returns a pointer to the '\0'
terminator of the WHITESPACE string (as mentioned in man strchr: "The
terminating null byte is considered part of the string, so that if c
is specified as '\0', these functions return a pointer to the
terminator.");
- at line 241, e is incremented;
- at line 242, \*buf points out-of-bounds, to the first character after
the '\0' terminator of our message;
- later, the out-of-bounds string at \*buf (supposedly the body of our
syslog message) is written (leaked) to the journal.
Consequently, we can read this out-of-bounds string:
- either directly from the journal (if journald's "Storage" is
"persistent", or "auto" and /var/log/journal/ exists), because
journald supports extended file ACLs (Access Control Lists):
$ id

/var/run/utmp, because journald writes ("walls") emergency messages
(LOG\_EMERG) to the tty of every logged-in user; our exploit records a

methods exist (for example, utempter and gnome-pty-helper):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exploitation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
For today we will take the body parts and put them on the wall
-- System of a Down, "Dreaming"
To leak a stack address or an mmap address from journald:
- First, we send a large native message to /run/systemd/journal/socket;
journald mmap()s our message, and malloc()ates a large array of iovec
structures: most of these structures point into our mmap()ed message,
but some of them point to the stack (in dispatch\_message\_real()). The
contents of this iovec array (especially the mmap and stack pointers)
are preserved in a heap hole after free() (after journald finishes
processing our message).
- Next, we send a large syslog message to /run/systemd/journal/dev-log;
to receive our large message (in server\_process\_datagram()), journald
realloc()ates its server buffer into the heap hole that previously
contained the iovec array (and still contains remains of mmap and
stack pointers).
- Last, we send a large syslog message that exploits CVE-2018-16866;
journald receives our large message in its server buffer (in the heap
chunk that previously contained the iovec array), and if we carefully
choose the size of our message and position its terminating ":" in
front of a remaining mmap or stack pointer, then we can leak this
pointer (it is mistakenly read out-of-bounds as the body of our
message).
From this leaked stack pointer we easily deduce journald's stack pointer
before the alloca() jump, because the distance between the two depends
only on journald's executable.
From the leaked mmap address we can deduce libc's address, but chunks of
unknown sizes are mmap()ed between the two, and we must therefore adopt
different strategies based on our target architecture (i386 or amd64).
========================================================================
Combined Exploitation of CVE-2018-16865 and CVE-2018-16866
========================================================================
Don't leave your seats now
Popcorn everywhere ...
-- System of a Down, "CUBErt"
------------------------------------------------------------------------
amd64 Exploitation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- To deduce libc's address from the leaked mmap address of our native
message, we arrange for this message to be mmap()ed into the 2MB hole
between ld.so's read-execute and read-only segments: from this hole's
address we deduce ld.so's address, and hence libc's address (with help
from ldd's output).
- If the resulting stack-to-libc distance is jumpable (if it is shorter
than 4GB), then we proceed with our "write-what-where"; otherwise, we
restart journald (we crash it with an alloca() of RLIMIT\_STACK -- 8MB
by default) and try again.
We have a good chance of obtaining a jumpable stack-to-libc distance
(and hence a root shell) after 2048 tries \* 2 seconds ~= 68 minutes
(by default, if journald crashes less than 5 times within 10 seconds,
it is restarted automatically by systemd).
- For the "write-where" part of our "write-what-where", we overwrite
libc's \_\_free\_hook function pointer, whose address modulo 16 is always
equal to 8 (on every amd64 distribution that we exploited).
- For the "write-what" part of our "write-what-where", we overwrite
\_\_free\_hook with the address of libc's system() function: whenever
journald free()s data that we control, we achieve arbitrary command
execution.
Last-minute note: on CentOS 7, the usual function pointers in libc's
read-write segment (\_\_free\_hook, \_\_malloc\_hook, etc) are not located at
multiples of 16 plus 8. To circumvent this problem:
- First, we overwrite the "\_chain" pointer of stderr's FILE structure
with the address of our own fake FILE structure (this "\_chain" pointer
is located at a multiple of 16 plus 8, in libc's read-write segment).
- Next, we corrupt one of malloc's internal variables (also in libc's
read-write segment).
- Last, we force a call to malloc() or free(), which detects the
corruption of its internal variable and calls abort(), which calls
\_IO\_flush\_all\_lockp(), which follows stderr's overwritten "\_chain"
pointer to our fake FILE structure; we eventually achieve arbitrary
command execution by calling libc's system() via one of the function
pointers in our fake FILE structure.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
i386 Exploitation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our i386 exploit is very similar to the amd64 exploit, but:
- The stack-to-libc distance is always jumpable (it is roughly 128MB).
- There is no hole between ld.so's read-execute and read-only segments.
However, libc's address is randomized in a narrow range of 1MB and is
therefore brute forcible: we have a good chance of correctly guessing
libc's address after 1MB / 4KB = 256 tries \* 2 seconds ~= 8 minutes.
- For the "write-where" part of our "write-what-where", we overwrite
libc's \_\_malloc\_hook function pointer (\_\_free\_hook was never located
at a multiple of 16 plus 8 or 12 on the i386 distributions that we
exploited, but \_\_malloc\_hook always is).
- For the "write-what" part of our "write-what-where", we overwrite
\_\_malloc\_hook with the address of a "mov esp, 0x89fffa5d ; ret" gadget
(or equivalent stack pivot): since our native message can be as large
as 768MB, we can mmap() it at 0x89fffa5d, take control of the stack,
and return into libc's execve().

**systemd** is a [software suite](/wiki/Software_suite "Software suite") that provides an array of system components for [Linux](/wiki/Linux "Linux")[[7]](#cite_note-7) operating systems. The main aim is to unify service configuration and behavior across [Linux distributions](/wiki/Linux_distribution "Linux distribution").[[8]](#cite_note-8) Its primary component is a "system and service manager" — an [init](/wiki/Init "Init") system used to [bootstrap](/wiki/Bootstrapping "Bootstrapping") [user space](/wiki/User_space "User space") and manage [user processes](/wiki/Process_%28computing%29 "Process (computing)"). It also provides replacements for various [daemons](/wiki/Daemon_%28computing%29 "Daemon (computing)") and utilities, including device management, login management, network connection management, and event logging. The name *systemd* adheres to the [Unix](/wiki/Unix "Unix") convention of naming daemons by appending the letter *d*.[[9]](#cite_note-9) It also plays on the term "[System D](/wiki/System_D "System D")", which refers to a person's ability to adapt quickly and improvise to solve problems.[[10]](#cite_note-control-center-10)

Since 2015, the majority of Linux distributions have adopted systemd, having replaced other init systems such as [SysV init](/wiki/SysV_init "SysV init"). It has been praised by developers and users of distributions that adopted it for providing a stable, fast out-of-the-box solution for issues that had existed in the Linux space for years.[[11]](#cite_note-11)[[12]](#cite_note-12)[[13]](#cite_note-arch-migration-to-systemd-13) At the time of adoption of systemd on most Linux distributions, it was the only software suite that offered reliable [parallelism](/wiki/Parallelism_%28computing%29 "Parallelism (computing)") during boot as well as centralized management of [processes](/wiki/Process_%28computing%29 "Process (computing)"), daemons, services and [mount points](/wiki/Mount_point "Mount point").

Critics of systemd contend that it suffers from [mission creep](/wiki/Mission_creep "Mission creep") and [bloat](/wiki/Software_bloat "Software bloat"), the latter affecting other software (such as the [GNOME](/wiki/GNOME "GNOME") desktop), adding dependencies on systemd, reducing its compatibility with other [Unix-like operating systems](/wiki/Unix-like "Unix-like") and making it difficult for sysadmins to integrate alternative solutions. In addition, they contend that the complexity of systemd results in a larger [attack surface](/wiki/Attack_surface "Attack surface"), reducing the overall security of the platform.[[14]](#cite_note-14) Concerns have also been raised about [Red Hat](/wiki/Red_Hat "Red Hat") and its parent company [IBM](/wiki/IBM "IBM") controlling the scene of init systems on Linux.[[15]](#cite_note-15)[[1]](#cite_note-The_New_Stack-1) A number of new forked Linux distributions have since been created that use alternative init systems like SysV or [OpenRC](/wiki/OpenRC "OpenRC").[[16]](#cite_note-16) Systemd has not been adopted by Unix-like systems outside the Linux space, like [FreeBSD](/wiki/FreeBSD "FreeBSD"), [OpenBSD](/wiki/OpenBSD "OpenBSD") and [Solaris](/wiki/Oracle_Solaris "Oracle Solaris").

## History

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")]

[Lennart Poettering](/wiki/Lennart_Poettering "Lennart Poettering") and [Kay Sievers](/wiki/Kay_Sievers "Kay Sievers"), the [software engineers](/wiki/Software_engineer "Software engineer") then working for [Red Hat](/wiki/Red_Hat "Red Hat") who initially developed systemd,[[2]](#cite_note-README-2) started a project to replace Linux's conventional System V init in 2010.[[17]](#cite_note-17) An April 2010 blog post from Poettering, titled "Rethinking PID 1", introduced an experimental version of what would later become systemd.[[18]](#cite_note-18) They sought to surpass the efficiency of the [init daemon](/wiki/Init "Init") in several ways. They wanted to improve the [software framework](/wiki/Software_framework "Software framework") for expressing dependencies, to allow more processes to run [concurrently](/wiki/Concurrency_%28computer_science%29 "Concurrency (computer science)") or in [parallel](/wiki/Parallel_computing "Parallel computing") during system [booting](/wiki/Booting "Booting"), and to reduce the [computational overhead](/wiki/Overhead_%28computing%29 "Overhead (computing)") of the [shell](/wiki/Shell_%28computing%29 "Shell (computing)").

In May 2011, [Fedora Linux](/wiki/Fedora_Linux "Fedora Linux") became the first major Linux distribution to enable systemd by default, replacing [Upstart](/wiki/Upstart_%28software%29 "Upstart (software)"). The reasoning at the time was that systemd provided extensive parallelization during startup, better management of processes and overall a saner, dependency-based approach to control of the system.[[19]](#cite_note-fedora-systemd-19)

In October 2012, [Arch Linux](/wiki/Arch_Linux "Arch Linux") made systemd the default, switching from [SysVinit](/wiki/SysVinit "SysVinit").[[20]](#cite_note-20) Developers had debated since August 2012[[13]](#cite_note-arch-migration-to-systemd-13) and came to the conclusion that it was faster and had more features than SysVinit, and that maintaining the latter was not worth the effort in patches.[[21]](#cite_note-21) Some of them thought that the criticism towards the implementation of systemd was not based on actual shortcomings of the software, rather the disliking of Lennart from a part of the Linux community and the general hesitation for change. Specifically, some of the complaints regarding systemd not being programmed in bash, it being bigger and more extensive than SysVinit, the use of [D-bus](/wiki/D-bus "D-bus"), and the optional on-disk format of the journal were regarded as advantages by programmers.[[22]](#cite_note-22)

Between October 2013 and February 2014, a long debate among the Debian Technical Committee occurred on the [Debian](/wiki/Debian "Debian") mailing list,[[23]](#cite_note-debian-bug-23) discussing which init system to use as the default in Debian 8 "jessie", and culminating in a decision in favor of systemd. The debate was widely publicized[[24]](#cite_note-lwn-20131105-24)[[25]](#cite_note-phoronix-20131230-25) and in the wake of the decision the debate continues on the Debian mailing list. In February 2014, after Debian's decision was made, [Mark Shuttleworth](/wiki/Mark_Shuttleworth "Mark Shuttleworth") announced in his blog that [Ubuntu](/wiki/Ubuntu_%28operating_system%29 "Ubuntu (operating system)") would follow in implementing systemd, discarding its own [Upstart](/wiki/Upstart_%28software%29 "Upstart (software)").[[26]](#cite_note-Shuttleworth-26)[[27]](#cite_note-quantal-27)

In November 2014, Debian Developer Joey Hess,[[28]](#cite_note-hess-resignation-28) Debian Technical Committee members Russ Allbery[[29]](#cite_note-allbery-resignation-29) and [Ian Jackson](/wiki/Ian_Jackson "Ian Jackson"),[[30]](#cite_note-jackson-resignation-30) and systemd package-maintainer Tollef Fog Heen[[31]](#cite_note-heen-resignation-31) resigned from their positions. All four justified their decision on the public Debian mailing list and in personal blogs with their exposure to extraordinary stress-levels related to ongoing disputes on systemd integration within the Debian and [FOSS](/wiki/FOSS "FOSS") community that rendered regular maintenance virtually impossible.

In August 2015, systemd started providing a login shell, callable via **`machinectl shell`**.[[32]](#cite_note-32)

In September 2016, a [security bug](/wiki/Security_bug "Security bug") was discovered that allowed any unprivileged user to perform a denial-of-service attack against systemd.[[33]](#cite_note-33) Rich Felker, developer of [musl](/wiki/Musl "Musl"), stated that this bug reveals a major "system development design flaw".[[34]](#cite_note-34) In 2017 another security bug was discovered in systemd, [CVE](/wiki/CVE_%28identifier%29 "CVE (identifier)")-[2017-9445](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9445), which "allows disruption of service" by a "malicious DNS server".[[35]](#cite_note-35)[[36]](#cite_note-36) Later in 2017, the [Pwnie Awards](/wiki/Pwnie_Awards "Pwnie Awards") gave author Lennart Poettering a "lamest vendor response" award due to his handling of the vulnerabilities.[[37]](#cite_note-37)

## Design

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Design")]
[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Systemd_components.svg/440px-Systemd_components.svg.png)](/wiki/File%3ASystemd_components.svg)

The architecture of systemd as it is used by [Tizen](/wiki/Tizen "Tizen"). Several systemd targets, including `telephony`, `bootmode`, `dlog`, and `tizen service` are from Tizen and are not components of systemd.[[38]](#cite_note-Gundersen2014-38)

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Linux_kernel_unified_hierarchy_cgroups_and_systemd.svg/440px-Linux_kernel_unified_hierarchy_cgroups_and_systemd.svg.png)](/wiki/File%3ALinux_kernel_unified_hierarchy_cgroups_and_systemd.svg)

Unified-hierarchy [cgroups](/wiki/Cgroups "Cgroups") will be accessible exclusively by systemd through `systemd-nspawn`[[39]](#cite_note-39)

Poettering describes systemd development as "never finished, never complete, but tracking progress of technology". In May 2014, Poettering further described systemd as unifying "pointless differences between distributions", by providing the following three general functions:[[40]](#cite_note-gnome_asia_2014-40)

* A system and service manager (manages both the system, by applying various configurations, and its services)
* A [software platform](/wiki/Computing_platform "Computing platform") (serves as a basis for developing other software)
* The glue between [applications](/wiki/Application_software "Application software") and the [kernel](/wiki/Linux_kernel "Linux kernel") (provides various interfaces that expose functionalities provided by the kernel)

systemd includes features like on-demand starting of daemons, snapshot support, process tracking[[41]](#cite_note-41) and Inhibitor Locks.[[42]](#cite_note-42) It is not just the name of the init daemon but also refers to the entire software bundle around it, which, in addition to the systemd init daemon, includes the daemons journald, logind and networkd, and many other low-level components. In January 2013, Poettering described systemd not as one program, but rather a large software suite that includes 69 individual binaries.[[43]](#cite_note-biggest_myths-43) As an integrated [software suite](/wiki/Software_suite "Software suite"), systemd replaces the [startup sequences](/wiki/Linux_startup_process "Linux startup process") and [runlevels](/wiki/Runlevel "Runlevel") controlled by the traditional init daemon, along with the [shell scripts](/wiki/Shell_script "Shell script") executed under its control. systemd also integrates many other services that are common on Linux systems by handling user logins, the [system console](/wiki/System_console "System console"), device hotplugging (see [udev](/wiki/Udev "Udev")), scheduled execution (replacing [cron](/wiki/Cron "Cron")), logging, hostnames and locales.

Like the init daemon, systemd is a daemon that manages other daemons, which, including systemd itself, are [background processes](/wiki/Background_process "Background process"). systemd is the first daemon to start during [booting](/wiki/Booting "Booting") and the last daemon to terminate during [shutdown](/wiki/Shutdown_%28computing%29 "Shutdown (computing)"). The systemd daemon serves as the root of the user space's [process tree](/wiki/Child_process "Child process"); the first process ([PID](/wiki/Process_identifier "Process identifier") 1) has a special role on Unix systems, as it replaces the parent of a process when the original parent terminates. Therefore, the first process is particularly well suited for the purpose of monitoring daemons.

systemd executes elements of its startup sequence in parallel, which is theoretically faster than the traditional startup sequence approach.[[44]](#cite_note-debian-debate-44) For [inter-process communication](/wiki/Inter-process_communication "Inter-process communication") (IPC), systemd makes [Unix domain sockets](/wiki/Unix_domain_socket "Unix domain socket") and [D-Bus](/wiki/D-Bus "D-Bus") available to the running daemons. The state of systemd itself can also be preserved in a [snapshot](/wiki/Snapshot_%28computer_storage%29 "Snapshot (computer storage)") for future recall.

### Core components and libraries

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Core components and libraries")]

Following its integrated approach, systemd also provides replacements for various daemons and utilities, including the startup shell scripts, pm-utils, [inetd](/wiki/Inetd "Inetd"), acpid, [syslog](/wiki/Syslog "Syslog"), watchdog, [cron](/wiki/Cron "Cron") and [atd](/wiki/At_%28command%29 "At (command)"). systemd's core components include:

* systemd is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems.
* systemctl is a command to introspect and control the state of the systemd system and service manager. Not to be confused with [sysctl](/wiki/Sysctl "Sysctl").
* systemd-analyze may be used to determine system boot-up performance statistics and retrieve other state and tracing information from the system and service manager.

systemd tracks processes using the Linux kernel's [cgroups](/wiki/Cgroups "Cgroups") subsystem instead of using [process identifiers](/wiki/Process_identifier "Process identifier") (PIDs); thus, daemons cannot "escape" systemd, not even by double-[forking](/wiki/Fork_%28system_call%29 "Fork (system call)"). systemd not only uses cgroups, but also augments them with systemd-nspawn and machinectl, two utility programs that facilitate the creation and management of [Linux containers](/wiki/Linux_containers "Linux containers").[[45]](#cite_note-lwn-20131107-45) Since version 205, systemd also offers ControlGroupInterface, which is an API to the Linux kernel cgroups.[[46]](#cite_note-systemd-controller-46) The Linux kernel cgroups are adapted to support [kernfs](/wiki/Kernfs_%28Linux%29 "Kernfs (Linux)"),[[47]](#cite_note-lkml-20140128-47) and are being modified to support a unified hierarchy.[[48]](#cite_note-lkml-20140313-48)

### Ancillary components

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Ancillary components")]

Beside its primary purpose of providing a Linux init system, the systemd suite can provide additional functionality, including the following components:

journald
systemd-journald is a daemon responsible for [event](/wiki/Event_%28computing%29 "Event (computing)") [logging](/wiki/Logfile "Logfile"), with append-only [binary files](/wiki/Binary_file "Binary file") serving as its [logfiles](/wiki/Logfile "Logfile"). The [system administrator](/wiki/System_administrator "System administrator") may choose whether to log system events with systemd-journald, [syslog-ng](/wiki/Syslog-ng "Syslog-ng") or [rsyslog](/wiki/Rsyslog "Rsyslog"). The potential for corruption of the binary format has led to much heated debate.[[49]](#cite_note-49)
libudev
libudev is the standard library for utilizing udev, which allows third-party applications to query udev resources.
localed
localed manages the [system locale](/wiki/Locale_%28computer_software%29 "Locale (computer software)") and [keyboard layout](/wiki/Keyboard_layout "Keyboard layout").
logind
systemd-logind is a daemon that manages user logins and seats in various ways. It is an integrated login manager that offers [multiseat](/wiki/Multiseat_configuration "Multiseat configuration") improvements[[50]](#cite_note-logind-service-50) and replaces *ConsoleKit*, which is no longer maintained.[[51]](#cite_note-consolekit-51) For [X11 display managers](/wiki/X_display_manager_%28program_type%29 "X display manager (program type)") the switch to logind requires a minimal amount of porting.[[52]](#cite_note-display-managers-52) It was integrated in systemd version 30.
hostnamed
hostnamed manages the [system hostname](/wiki/Hostname "Hostname").
homed
homed is a daemon that provides portable human-user accounts that are independent of current system configuration. homed moves various pieces of data such as UID/GID from various places across the filesystem into one file, `~/.identity`. homed manages the user's home directory in various ways such as a plain directory, a [btrfs](/wiki/Btrfs "Btrfs") subvolume, a [Linux Unified Key Setup](/wiki/Linux_Unified_Key_Setup "Linux Unified Key Setup") volume, an fscrypt directory, or mounted from an [SMB](/wiki/Server_Message_Block "Server Message Block") server.
networkd
networkd is a daemon to handle the configuration of the network interfaces; in version 209, when it was first integrated, support was limited to statically assigned addresses and basic support for [bridging](/wiki/Bridging_%28networking%29 "Bridging (networking)") configuration.[[53]](#cite_note-systemd-1-53)[[54]](#cite_note-systemd-2-54)[[55]](#cite_note-systemd-3-55)[[56]](#cite_note-systemd-4-56)[[57]](#cite_note-systemd-5-57) In July 2014, systemd version 215 was released, adding new features such as a [DHCP](/wiki/DHCP "DHCP") server for [IPv4](/wiki/IPv4 "IPv4") hosts, and [VXLAN](/wiki/VXLAN "VXLAN") support.[[58]](#cite_note-phoronix-20140704-58)[[59]](#cite_note-59) `networkctl` may be used to review the state of the network links as seen by systemd-networkd.[[60]](#cite_note-60) Configuration of new interfaces has to be added under the /lib/systemd/network/ as a new file ending with .network extension.
resolved
provides network name resolution to local applications
systemd-boot
[systemd-boot](/wiki/Systemd-boot "Systemd-boot") is a boot manager, formerly known as [gummiboot](/wiki/Gummiboot_%28software%29 "Gummiboot (software)"). Kay Sievers merged it into systemd with rev 220.
systemd-bsod
systemd-bsod is an error reporter used to generate [Blue Screen of Death](/wiki/Blue_Screen_of_Death "Blue Screen of Death").
systemd-nspawn
systemd-nspawn may be used to run a command or OS in a namespace container.
timedated
systemd-timedated is a daemon that can be used to control time-related settings, such as the system time, system [time zone](/wiki/Time_zone "Time zone"), or selection between [UTC](/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time "Coordinated Universal Time") and local time-zone system clock. It is accessible through D-Bus.[[61]](#cite_note-timedated-61) It was integrated in systemd version 30.
timesyncd
timesyncd is a client [NTP](/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol "Network Time Protocol") daemon for synchronizing the system clock across the network.
tmpfiles
systemd-tmpfiles is a utility that takes care of creation and clean-up of temporary files and directories. It is normally run once at startup and then in specified intervals.
udevd
[udev](/wiki/Udev "Udev") is a device manager for the [Linux kernel](/wiki/Linux_kernel "Linux kernel"), which handles the /dev directory and all [user space](/wiki/User_space "User space") actions when adding/removing devices, including [firmware](/wiki/Firmware "Firmware") loading. In April 2012, the [source tree](/wiki/Source_tree "Source tree") for udev was [merged](/wiki/Merge_%28revision_control%29 "Merge (revision control)") into the systemd source tree.[[62]](#cite_note-sievers-20120403-62)[[63]](#cite_note-sievers-20120525-63) In order to match the version number of udev, systemd maintainers bumped the version number directly from 44 to 183.[[64]](#cite_note-64)
On 29 May 2014, support for firmware loading through udev was dropped from systemd, as it was decided that the kernel should be responsible for loading firmware.[[65]](#cite_note-65)
### Configuration of systemd

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Configuration of systemd")]
[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Systemd_manager.png/220px-Systemd_manager.png)](/wiki/File%3ASystemd_manager.png)

systemd-manager, a tool to configure systemd

systemd is configured exclusively via [plain](/wiki/Plain_text "Plain text")-[text files](/wiki/Text_file "Text file") although GUI tools such as systemd-manager are also available.

systemd records initialization instructions for each daemon in a [configuration file](/wiki/Configuration_file "Configuration file") (referred to as a "unit file") that uses a [declarative language](/wiki/Declarative_language "Declarative language"), replacing the traditionally used per-daemon startup [shell scripts](/wiki/Shell_script "Shell script"). The syntax of the language is inspired by [.ini files](/wiki/INI_file "INI file").[[66]](#cite_note-66)

Unit-file types[[67]](#cite_note-unitfiles-67) include:

* .service
* .socket
* .device (automatically initiated by systemd[[68]](#cite_note-68))
* .mount
* .automount
* .swap
* .target
* .path
* .timer (which can be used as a [cron](/wiki/Cron "Cron")-like [job scheduler](/wiki/Job_scheduler "Job scheduler")[[69]](#cite_note-phoronix-20130128-69))
* .snapshot
* .slice (used to group and manage processes and resources[[70]](#cite_note-70))
* .scope (used to group worker processes, not intended to be configured via unit files[[71]](#cite_note-71))

While many distributions boot systemd by default, some allow other init systems to be used; in this case switching the init system is possible by installing the appropriate packages. A [fork](/wiki/Fork_%28software_development%29 "Fork (software development)") of Debian called [Devuan](/wiki/Devuan "Devuan") was developed to avoid systemd[[99]](#cite_note-102)[[100]](#cite_note-103) and has reached version 5.0 for stable usage. In December 2019, the Debian project voted in favour of retaining systemd as the default init system for the distribution, but with support for "exploring alternatives".[[101]](#cite_note-104)

### Integration with other software

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Integration with other software")]

In the interest of enhancing the interoperability between systemd and the [GNOME](/wiki/GNOME "GNOME") desktop environment, systemd coauthor Lennart Poettering asked [the GNOME Project](/wiki/The_GNOME_Project "The GNOME Project") to consider making systemd an external [dependency](/wiki/Dependency_%28computer_science%29 "Dependency (computer science)") of GNOME 3.2.[[102]](#cite_note-Poettering-GNOME-105)

In November 2012, the GNOME Project concluded that basic GNOME functionality should not rely on systemd.[[103]](#cite_note-Paters-106) However, GNOME 3.8 introduced a compile-time choice between the logind and ConsoleKit API, the former being provided at the time only by systemd. Ubuntu provided a separate logind binary, but systemd became a *de facto* dependency of GNOME for most [Linux distributions](/wiki/Linux_distribution "Linux distribution"), in particular since ConsoleKit is no longer actively maintained and upstream recommends the use of systemd-logind instead.[[104]](#cite_note-consolekit-abandoned-107) The developers of [Gentoo Linux](/wiki/Gentoo_Linux "Gentoo Linux") also attempted to adapt these changes in [OpenRC](/wiki/OpenRC "OpenRC"), but the implementation contained too many bugs, causing the distribution to mark systemd as a dependency of GNOME.[[105]](#cite_note-Vitters-108)[[106]](#cite_note-wayland-109)

GNOME has further integrated logind.[[107]](#cite_note-systemd-gnome-110) As of [Mutter](/wiki/Mutter_%28software%29 "Mutter (software)") version 3.13.2, logind is a dependency for [Wayland](/wiki/Wayland_%28software%29 "Wayland (software)") sessions.[[108]](#cite_note-mutter-logind-111)

## Reception

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Reception")]

The design of systemd has ignited controversy within the [free-software community](/wiki/Free-software_community "Free-software community"). Critics regard systemd as overly complex and suffering from continued [feature creep](/wiki/Feature_creep "Feature creep"), arguing that its architecture violates the [Unix philosophy](/wiki/Unix_philosophy "Unix philosophy"). There is also concern that it forms a system of interlocked dependencies, thereby giving distribution maintainers little choice but to adopt systemd as more user-space software comes to depend on its components, which is similar to the problems created by [PulseAudio](/wiki/PulseAudio "PulseAudio"), another of Lennart Poettering's projects.[[109]](#cite_note-112)[[110]](#cite_note-113)

In a 2012 interview, [Slackware](/wiki/Slackware "Slackware")'s lead [Patrick Volkerding](/wiki/Patrick_Volkerding "Patrick Volkerding") expressed reservations about the systemd architecture, stating his belief that its design was contrary to the Unix philosophy of interconnected utilities with narrowly defined functionalities.[[111]](#cite_note-volkerding-2012-114) As of August 2018[[update]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit), Slackware does not support or use systemd, but Volkerding has not ruled out the possibility of switching to it.[[112]](#cite_note-slackware-systemd-115)

In January 2013, Lennart Poettering attempted to address concerns about systemd in a blog post called *The Biggest Myths*.[[43]](#cite_note-biggest_myths-43)

In February 2014, [musl](/wiki/Musl "Musl")'s Rich Felker opined that [PID](/wiki/Process_identifier "Process identifier") 1 is too special to be saddled with additional responsibilities, believing that PID 1 should only be responsible for starting the rest of the init system and reaping [zombie processes](/wiki/Zombie_process "Zombie process"), and that the additional functionality added by systemd can be provided elsewhere and unnecessarily increases the complexity and attack surface of PID 1.[[113]](#cite_note-116)

In March 2014, [Eric S. Raymond](/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond "Eric S. Raymond") commented that systemd's design goals were prone to [mission creep](/wiki/Mission_creep "Mission creep") and [software bloat](/wiki/Software_bloat "Software bloat").[[114]](#cite_note-esr-slashdot-2014-117) In April 2014, [Linus Torvalds](/wiki/Linus_Torvalds "Linus Torvalds") expressed reservations about the attitude of [Kay Sievers](/wiki/Kay_Sievers "Kay Sievers"), a key systemd developer, toward users and bug reports in regard to modifications to the Linux kernel submitted by Sievers.[[115]](#cite_note-lkml-20140402-118) In late April 2014, a campaign to boycott systemd was launched, with a website listing various reasons against its adoption.[[116]](#cite_note-upload-119)[[117]](#cite_note-boycott-120)

In an August 2014 article published in *[InfoWorld](/wiki/InfoWorld "InfoWorld")*, Paul Venezia wrote about the systemd controversy and attributed the controversy to violation of the Unix philosophy, and to "enormous egos who firmly believe they can do no wrong".[[118]](#cite_note-apocalypse-121) The article also characterizes the architecture of systemd as similar to that of [svchost.exe](/wiki/Svchost.exe "Svchost.exe"), a critical system component in [Microsoft Windows](/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "Microsoft Windows") with a broad functional scope.[[118]](#cite_note-apocalypse-121)

In a September 2014 [ZDNet](/wiki/ZDNet "ZDNet") interview, prominent Linux kernel developer [Theodore Ts'o](/wiki/Theodore_Ts%27o "Theodore Ts'o") expressed his opinion that the dispute over systemd's centralized design philosophy, more than technical concerns, indicates a dangerous general trend toward uniformizing the Linux ecosystem, alienating and marginalizing parts of the open-source community, and leaving little room for alternative projects. He cited similarities with the attitude he found in the GNOME project toward non-standard configurations.[[119]](#cite_note-zdnet-20140919-122) On social media, Ts'o also later compared the attitudes of Sievers and his co-developer, Lennart Poettering, to that of GNOME's developers.[[120]](#cite_note-Tso-123)

## Forks and alternative implementations

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Forks and alternative implementations")]

Forks of systemd are closely tied to critiques of it outlined in the above section. Forks generally try to improve on at least one of portability (to other libcs and Unix-like systems), modularity, or size. A few forks have collaborated under the FreeInit banner.[[121]](#cite_note-124)

### Forks of components

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Forks of components")]
#### eudev

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: eudev")]

In 2012, the [Gentoo Linux](/wiki/Gentoo_Linux "Gentoo Linux") project created a [fork](/wiki/Fork_%28software_development%29 "Fork (software development)") of [udev](/wiki/Udev "Udev") in order to avoid dependency on the systemd architecture. The resulting fork is called *eudev* and it makes udev functionality available without systemd.[[122]](#cite_note-eudev-125) A stated goal of the project is to keep eudev independent of any Linux distribution or init system.[[123]](#cite_note-gentoo-eudev-126) In 2021, Gentoo announced that support of eudev would cease at the beginning of 2022. An independent group of maintainers have since taken up eudev.[[124]](#cite_note-eudev-news-127)

#### elogind

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: elogind")]

Elogind is the systemd project's "logind", extracted to be a standalone daemon. It integrates with PAM to know the set of users that are logged into a system and whether they are logged in graphically, on the console, or remotely. Elogind exposes this information via the standard org.freedesktop.login1 [D-Bus](/wiki/D-Bus "D-Bus") interface, as well as through the file system using systemd's standard /run/systemd layout. Elogind also provides "libelogind", which is a subset of the facilities offered by "libsystemd". There is a "libelogind.pc" [pkg-config](/wiki/Pkg-config "Pkg-config") file as well.[[125]](#cite_note-elogind-128)

### Alternatives to components

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Alternatives to components")]
#### ConsoleKit2

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: ConsoleKit2")]

ConsoleKit was forked in October 2014 by [Xfce](/wiki/Xfce "Xfce") developers wanting its features to still be maintained and available on operating systems other than Linux. While not ruling out the possibility of reviving the original repository in the long term, the main developer considers ConsoleKit2 a temporary necessity until systembsd matures.[[126]](#cite_note-consolekit2-129)

### Abandoned forks

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Abandoned forks")]
#### Fork of components

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Fork of components")]
##### LoginKit

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: LoginKit")]

LoginKit was an attempt to implement a logind (systemd-logind) [shim](/wiki/Shim_%28computing%29 "Shim (computing)"), which would allow packages that depend on systemd-logind to work without dependency on a specific init system.[[127]](#cite_note-loginkit-130) The project has been defunct since February 2015.[[128]](#cite_note-131)

##### systembsd

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: systembsd")]

In 2014, a [Google Summer of Code](/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code "Google Summer of Code") project named "systembsd" was started in order to provide alternative implementations of these APIs for [OpenBSD](/wiki/OpenBSD "OpenBSD"). The original project developer began it in order to ease his transition from Linux to OpenBSD.[[129]](#cite_note-undeadly_systembsd-132) Project development finished in July 2016.[[130]](#cite_note-133)

The systembsd project did not provide an init replacement, but aimed to provide OpenBSD with compatible daemons for hostnamed, timedated, localed, and logind. The project did not create new systemd-like functionality, and was only meant to act as a wrapper over the native OpenBSD system. The developer aimed for systembsd to be installable as part of the [ports collection](/wiki/Ports_collection "Ports collection"), not as part of a base system, stating that "systemd and \*BSD differ fundamentally in terms of philosophy and development practices."[[129]](#cite_note-undeadly_systembsd-132)

##### notsystemd

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: notsystemd")]

Notsystemd intends to implement all systemd's features working on any init system.[[131]](#cite_note-134) It was forked by the [Parabola GNU/Linux-libre](/wiki/Parabola_GNU/Linux-libre "Parabola GNU/Linux-libre") developers to build packages with their development tools without the necessity of having systemd installed to run systemd-nspawn. Development ceased in July 2018.[[132]](#cite_note-135)

#### Fork including init system

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Fork including init system")]
##### uselessd

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: uselessd")]

In 2014, *uselessd* was created as a lightweight fork of systemd. The project sought to remove features and programs deemed unnecessary for an init system, as well as address other perceived faults.[[133]](#cite_note-phoronix_uselessd-136) Project development halted in January 2015.[[134]](#cite_note-137)

uselessd supported the [musl](/wiki/Musl "Musl") and [μClibc](/wiki/UClibc "UClibc") libraries, so it may have been used on [embedded systems](/wiki/Embedded_system "Embedded system"), whereas systemd only supports [glibc](/wiki/GNU_C_Library "GNU C Library"). The uselessd project had planned further improvements on cross-platform compatibility, as well as architectural overhauls and refactoring for the Linux build in the future.[[135]](#cite_note-uselessd_home-138)

##### InitWare

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: InitWare")]

InitWare is a modular refactor of systemd, porting the system to BSD platforms without glibc or Linux-specific system calls. It is known to work on DragonFly BSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and GNU/Linux. Components considered unnecessary are dropped.[[136]](#cite_note-139)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1653867#c0)  Laura Pardo    2018-11-27 19:14:56 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in systemd-journald. An out-of-bounds read when parsing a crafted syslog message that could lead to information disclosure.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1653867#c1)  Doran Moppert    2018-11-28 02:29:27 UTC  ``` This vulnerability was introduced in systemd v221.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1653867#c2)  Laura Pardo    2018-11-28 13:21:46 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Qualys Research Labs   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1653867#c3)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-12-05 09:05:42 UTC  ``` Function syslog_parse_identifier() in journald-syslog.c file does not properly parse the log string in case it ends with a ":", returning a pointer beyond the original string's limits. A local attacker may use this flaw to get disclose systemd-journal process memory and get an information leak.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1653867#c4)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-12-05 09:12:57 UTC  ``` The flaw was introduced in: <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/ec5ff4445cca6a1d786b8da36cf6fe0acc0b94c8>  It was fixed with: <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/a6aadf4ae0bae185dc4c414d492a4a781c80ffe5> <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/8595102d3ddde6d25c282f965573a6de34ab4421>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1653867#c5)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-12-05 09:16:39 UTC  ``` RHEL 7.6 ships systemd v219, but commit ec5ff4445cca6a1d786b8da36cf6fe0acc0b94c8 was backported, thus making it vulnerable to this flaw as well.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1653867#c10)  Zbigniew Jędrzejewski-Szmek    2018-12-10 13:48:56 UTC  ``` This seems to be the same as <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/9829>, fixed by <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/a6aadf4ae0>. The provided reproducer does not work with git master.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1653867#c13)  Doran Moppert    2019-01-02 02:45:00 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of systemd as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having a security impact of Moderate. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: <https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/>.  Red Hat Virtualization Hypervisor and Management Appliance include vulnerable versions of systemd. However, since exploitation requires local access and impact is restricted to information disclosure, this flaw is rated as having a security issue of Low. Future updates may address this issue.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1653867#c14)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-01-10 07:58:57 UTC  ``` Created systemd tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1664975](show_bug.cgi?id=1664975 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-16866 systemd: out-of-bounds read when parsing a crafted syslog message [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1653867#c15)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-01-10 07:59:31 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://www.qualys.com/2019/01/09/system-down/system-down.txt>   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1653867#c19)  sabyrzhan    2019-03-05 18:14:10 UTC  ``` Please update the ETA of RHEL7 systemd errata for this CVE.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1653867#c20)  sabyrzhan    2019-03-11 16:29:57 UTC  ``` Please update the ETA for RHEL7 systemd errata release.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1653867#c21)  Laura Pardo    2019-03-11 19:38:02 UTC  ``` In reply to [comment #20](show_bug.cgi?id=1653867#c20): > Please update the ETA for RHEL7 systemd errata release.

If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.
