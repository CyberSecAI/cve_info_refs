Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-16855:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the PowerDNS Recursor's handling of DNS queries when computing the hash for packet cache lookup. A crafted DNS query can trigger an out-of-bounds memory read during this hash calculation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The core issue is an out-of-bounds read when processing a specially crafted DNS query. This occurs specifically during the hash calculation used for packet cache lookups.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service, as the out-of-bounds read can lead to a crash of the PowerDNS Recursor process.
*   **Degraded Service:** While a crash can lead to a restart (if the service is under a supervisor), the service is still temporarily degraded.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted DNS Queries:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted DNS queries to the vulnerable PowerDNS Recursor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** A remote attacker is capable of triggering this vulnerability by sending crafted DNS queries.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the PowerDNS Recursor instance.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Affected Versions:** PowerDNS Recursor versions 4.1.0 up to and including 4.1.7 are affected.
*   **Fixed Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 4.1.8 of PowerDNS Recursor.
*   **Severity:** The severity of the vulnerability is rated as "Medium".
*   **No System Compromise:**  The vulnerability does not lead to a full system compromise.
*   The vulnerability is described in the official advisory as "PowerDNS Security Advisory 2018-09".
