| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1625908#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2018-09-06 08:27:57 UTC  ```  This is an automatically created tracking bug!  It was created to ensure that one or more security vulnerabilities are fixed in affected versions of fedora-all.  For comments that are specific to the vulnerability please use bugs filed against the "Security Response" product referenced in the "Blocks" field.  For more information see: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/TrackingBugs>  When submitting as an update, use the fedpkg template provided in the next comment(s).  This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the fedpkg commit message.  NOTE: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. While only one tracking bug has been filed, please correct all affected versions at the same time.  If you need to fix the versions independent of each other, you may clone this bug as appropriate.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1625908#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2018-09-06 08:28:00 UTC  ``` Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.  This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1625907,1625908  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [PUT CVEs HERE]  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======  Additionally, you may opt to use the bodhi web interface to submit updates:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1625908#c2)  Ben Cotton    2019-05-02 20:58:43 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 28 is nearing its end of life. On 2019-May-28 Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 28. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '28'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 28 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1625908#c3)  Fedora Update System    2020-06-29 18:30:27 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2020-4aaf6e6d7c has been submitted as an update to Fedora 31. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2020-4aaf6e6d7c>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1625908#c4)  Fedora Update System    2020-06-30 00:55:23 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2020-4aaf6e6d7c has been pushed to the Fedora 31 testing repository.

`_substitute_whitespace` is better to be a const.

is there a reason why you're only matching agains double slashes, and not doing `target.replace('\', '/')`?

This matches one slash. Your comment is a syntax error because the first slash escapes the second one. You can't put a `\` before a quote at the end of a string literal in python. Try this:

`print '\\'`

Are there tests for all these specific ASCII characters that we are matching against? The only whitespace that I see in the tests are in `assert not helpers.is_safe_url(' javascript:alert(document.domain)')` and for that use-case a simple `replace(' ', '')` would do the job.

Please either expand the tests, or simplify the logic.

P.S. when checking for control characters, wouldn't it be simpler to do it in the same way as it's done in Django by checking `unicodedata.category` (see <https://github.com/django/django/blob/550cb3a365dee4edfdd1563224d5304de2a57fda/django/utils/http.py#L364>)?

| FYI, when having the latest version of `flask-admin` installed and you run `pipenv check` (which uses [pyup](https://pyup.io/)), you get something like:  ``` $ pipenv check Checking PEP 508 requirements… Passed! Checking installed package safety… 36437: flask-admin <=1.5.2 resolved (1.5.2 installed)! helpers.py in Flask-Admin 1.5.2 has Reflected XSS via a crafted URL. see https://github.com/flask-admin/flask-admin/pull/1699 ```  In which case if this is part of your tests/CI, you'll have to do `pipenv check --ignore 36437` |

If for whatever reason the original author of the PR cannot update the PR to addressnew code review comments, can someone else step in to finish the job?  FYI a day left Flask-Admin un-patched is a day hundreds of thousands of Flask-Admin sites vulnerable to this XSS attack! |
