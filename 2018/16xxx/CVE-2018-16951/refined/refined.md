Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly handle backticks (`) in the `nascan/plugin/masscan.py` file, specifically on lines 9 and 10. These backticks are not translated or escaped, allowing command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. The application allows user-supplied input (specifically the "速率" field under "启用MASSCAN") to be directly incorporated into a system command without sanitization or proper escaping of special characters like backticks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the vulnerable application. This allows for a wide range of malicious activities.
*   **Shell Access:** The provided example demonstrates how to gain a reverse shell on the server. This provides persistent access and complete control over the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Application UI:** The vulnerability is accessible through the application's user interface, specifically via the settings page under "配置" > "爬虫引擎" > "启用MASSCAN" > "速率".
*   **Payload Injection:** The attacker injects a malicious payload containing backticks into the "速率" field. This payload is then interpreted as a command by the server's operating system due to the lack of proper sanitization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be logged into the application. The default credentials `admin:xunfeng321` are mentioned, indicating that attackers could possibly use these default credentials.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know how to construct the malicious payload and where to inject it. The provided Python script provides the exploit payload.

**Additional Details:**

* The issue was reported on September 11, 2018.
