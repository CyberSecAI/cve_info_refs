# Baijiacms officials link

baijiacms: <https://github.com/baijiacms/baijiacmsV4>

# Why make this

BaijiacmsV4 does not open the issue,I can't feedback any issue,it's only possible to write up vulnerability here.

Non-standard use of the flash component, resulting in cross-site scripting attacks in the foreground，Attackers can obtain sensitive information such as cookie through vulnerability

PS:I submit the issue in this programer's another product which opens issue function
[baijiacms/baijiacmsV2-MultiManager#2](https://github.com/baijiacms/baijiacmsV2-MultiManager/issues/2)
