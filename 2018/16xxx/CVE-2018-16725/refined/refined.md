Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a non-standard use of the Flash component `ZeroClipboard.swf` in BaijiacmsV4. This improper usage allows for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an XSS issue. The application does not properly sanitize or validate input when using the Flash component, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can obtain sensitive information such as cookies through the XSS vulnerability. This could lead to session hijacking and other related attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `ZeroClipboard.swf` file. By crafting a malicious URL, an attacker can inject JavaScript code into the application's context.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Malicious URL Creation:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a URL that includes the malicious JavaScript payload.
- **User Interaction:** The user needs to be tricked into accessing the malicious URL to trigger the XSS attack.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) URL demonstrates how the attack works:
  `http://localhost/baijiacmsV4-master/assets/weengine/components/zclip/ZeroClipboard.swf?id=\"))}catch(e){alert(/test/.source);}//&width=500&height=500`
- This URL injects a JavaScript `alert()` function through the `id` parameter of the Flash component.

This information provides more specific details than a typical CVE description would have, detailing the exact attack vector and a PoC URL.
