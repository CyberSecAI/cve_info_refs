**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack buffer overflow

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program crash (as demonstrated by the AddressSanitizer output)
- Potential for arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the overflowed data.

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing a specially crafted BMP image file to the `imageworsener` application.
