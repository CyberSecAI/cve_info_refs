## Description

[![@riteshgupta1993](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42217817?v=4&size=48)](/riteshgupta1993)[riteshgupta1993](https://github.com/riteshgupta1993)opened [on Aug 15, 2018](https://github.com/frozeman/feindura-flat-file-cms/issues/29#issue-350768740)

• Fiendura version: 2.0.7

• PHP Version: 5.6.35

• Apache Version: 2.4.33

• Operating system: microsoft windows v10

VULNERABILITY TYPE: cross-site scripting.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.

An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. The end user's browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source; the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE:

1: login in Fiendura.

2: Go for creating a new page by clicking on the new page.

3: In the tags parameter, type the malicious javascript /default.aspx#"><img src=x onerror=prompt('0');>

4: The malicious javascript will be reflected in the browser.

PROOF OF CONCEPT:

Vulnerable URL: <http://127.0.0.16/index.php?category=0&page=new>

Vulnerable parameter: Tags

Malicious script: /default.aspx#"><img src=x onerror=prompt('0');>

1: enter the malicious javascript in the Tags parameter.

2: after entering the payload an XSS prompt will be reflected on the browser.
