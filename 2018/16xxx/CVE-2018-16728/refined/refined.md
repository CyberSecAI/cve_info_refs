- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the "Tags" parameter when creating a new page. Specifically, it does not encode or validate the input before displaying it on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application takes user-supplied data in the "Tags" parameter and reflects it back in the browser without proper sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Tags" parameter. This code will be executed by the victim's browser when they view the page, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information. The attacker could also rewrite the HTML page content.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects the malicious script via the "Tags" parameter when creating a new page. The vulnerability is triggered when a user views a page containing the injected script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to log in to the Fiendura application and create a new page. They also need to be able to input the malicious script into the "Tags" parameter.
