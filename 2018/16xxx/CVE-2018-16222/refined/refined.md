  "vulnerability_details": {
    "CVE-2018-16222": {
      "root_cause": "The iSmartAlarm Android application stores user credentials (username and password) in cleartext within the iSmartAlermData.xml configuration file.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cleartext storage of sensitive data"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can retrieve user credentials, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the iSmartAlarm system.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Physical access to the device is needed to extract the iSmartAlermData.xml configuration file."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs physical access to the Android device where the iSmartAlarm application is installed, and the ability to extract the configuration file."
    },
     "CVE-2018-16223": {
      "root_cause": "The QBee Camera Android application stores encrypted user credentials in an XML settings file (com.vestiacom.qbeecamera_preferences.xml). The encryption key is derived from a value within the same file using a modified version of the 'Secure Preferences' library, allowing for decryption.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure cryptographic storage",
          "Use of hardcoded strings in key derivation"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can decrypt the configuration file, retrieving user credentials and potentially gaining unauthorized access to the QBee camera system.",
      "attack_vectors": [
       "Physical access to the Android device to extract the configuration file.",
        "Reverse engineering the modified Secure Preferences library to derive the encryption key."
      ],
         "attacker_capabilities":"The attacker needs physical access to the device, the ability to extract the configuration file, and the skills to reverse engineer the encryption process."

    "CVE-2018-16224": {
       "root_cause": "The iSmartAlarm Cube One device exposes diagnostic logs through an unauthenticated network endpoint.",
      "weaknesses": [
       "Incorrect access control",
        "Lack of authentication for diagnostic data"
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker can retrieve diagnostic logs, which may contain sensitive information, such as user interactions and sensor data.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote access to the local network the device is on",
         "Sending a crafted TCP request to ports 12345 and 22306"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be on the same local network as the iSmartAlarm Cube One and be able to craft a TCP request to the diagnostic ports."
