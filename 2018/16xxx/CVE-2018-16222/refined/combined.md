# [CVE-2018-16222 to 16225] Multiple Vulnerabilities in QBee and iSmartAlarm Products

 [Francesco Servida](https://blog.francescoservida.ch/author/f_servida-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2--2/)[Oct 31, 2018Oct 5, 2022](https://blog.francescoservida.ch/2018/10/31/cve-2018-16222-to-16225-multiple-vulnerabilities-in-qbee-and-ismartalarm-products/)

The preface of the disclosure of CVE-2018-16225 (<https://blog.francescoservida.ch/2018/09/16/cve-2018-16225-public-disclosure-qbee-camera-vulnerability/>) contained a little lie: I did not find **one** vulnerability during the research for my master thesis, but **four**, three of which were still being patched by the vendor/under the 90 days disclosure timeframe given to the vendor.

In total four vulnerabilities were discovered, concerning the [QBee Multisensor Camera](http://qbeecam.com) (CVE-2018-16223 & CVE-2018-16225) and the [iSmartAlarm security device](https://www.ismartalarm.com/devices/cubeone/isa00011.html) (CVE-2018-16222 & CVE-2018-16224).

### [CVE-2018-16222] Cleartext Storage of credentials in iSmartAlarm Android Application

This first vulnerability is pretty simple; the Android application for iSmartAlarm stores the user credentials in cleartext the xml configuration file: **iSmartAlermData.xml**.

While it is true that an application need to store cloud credentials in order to maintain access to the cloud services, this credentials do not need to be the **username** and **password** of the user, but should instead be a revokable access token (Eg. via OAuth).

### [CVE-2018-16223] Insecure Cryptographic Storage of credentials – QBee Camera Application (Android)

This second vulnerability also concerns the storage of user cloud credentials in the XML settings of the application, in this case of the QBee Camera Application.

Although the QBee Cam credentials were encrypted, the encrypted settings were in a format suggesting the use of the common “[Secure Preferences](https://github.com/scottyab/secure-preferences)” library. By default, this library stores the AES key alongside the encrypted data in the XML file. However, none of the values was a valid AES key for the decryption. Analysis of the android application revealed that the function handling the encryption/decryption was a slightly modified version of the “Secure Preferences” one. The AES key is in fact derived from the value in the file, by inserting a hardcoded string and hashing it with SHA 256. With that knowledge it was possible to implement a decryption function in python.

An attacker with physical access to the user device can extract the configuration file from the QBee Camera application.

Using the derived key, the attacker is able to decrypt the configuration file and extract the username and password.

### [CVE-2018-16224] Incorrect access control for the diagnostic files of the iSmartAlarm Cube One

It was possible to intercept the diagnostic logs sent from the base station to the smartphone application.

[![](https://blog.francescoservida.ch/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ismart_diag_logth.png)](https://blog.francescoservida.ch/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ismart_diag_logth.png)

iSmartAlarm diagnostic log collection, first packets.

As the diagnostic endpoint was not authenticated the collection process was later integrated in a Python script in order to directly receive the data instead of having to intercept the stream to the smartphone application.

The vulnerability requires the attacker to have access to the local network on which the device resides.

The attacker is able to obtain a copy of the diagnostics logs from the CubeOne device without authentication needed.

The logs contain sensible information such as the interaction the user had with the cube one or the sensor logs. Other sensible information could be present but has not been studied.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.
