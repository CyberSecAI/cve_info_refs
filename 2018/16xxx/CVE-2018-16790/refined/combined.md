This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Fix for [CVE-2018-16790](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vmg6-94hc-5vqp "CVE-2018-16790") -- Verify bounds before binary length read.

```
As reported here: <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CDRIVER-2819>,
a heap overread occurs due a failure to correctly verify data
bounds.

In the original check, len - o returns the data left including the
sizeof(l) we just read. Instead, the comparison should check
against the data left NOT including the binary int32, i.e. just
subtype (byte*) instead of int32 subtype (byte*).

Added in test for corrupted BSON example.

In the original check, len - o returns the data left including the
sizeof(l) we just read. Instead, the comparison should check
against the data left NOT including the binary int32, i.e. just
subtype (byte*) instead of int32 subtype (byte*).

`[7c6aff9](/mongodb/mongo-c-driver/pull/537/commits/7c6aff9c3436810ccc4d34eea77d1f2c602c8245)`

```
As reported here: <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CDRIVER-2819>,
a heap overread occurs due a failure to correctly verify data
bounds.

In the original check, len - o returns the data left including the
sizeof(l) we just read. Instead, the comparison should check
against the data left NOT including the binary int32, i.e. just
subtype (byte*) instead of int32 subtype (byte*).

Added in test for corrupted BSON example.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1627923#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2018-09-11 21:29:23 UTC  ``` The function _bson_iter_next_internal in bson-iter.c in libbson 1.12.0, as used in MongoDB mongo-c-driver and other products, has a heap-based buffer over-read via a crafted bson buffer.  Upstream bug:  <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CDRIVER-2819>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1627923#c1)  Pedro Sampaio    2018-09-11 21:29:51 UTC  ``` Created libbson tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1627925](show_bug.cgi?id=1627925 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-16790 libbson: Heap-based buffer over-read in _bson_iter_next_internal in bson-iter.c [epel-7]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1627924](show_bug.cgi?id=1627924 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-16790 libbson: Heap-based buffer over-read in _bson_iter_next_internal in bson-iter.c [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1627923#c2)  Petr Pisar    2018-09-12 08:51:45 UTC  ``` libbson was merged into mongo-c-driver in Fedora â¥ 29.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1627923#c3)  Petr Pisar    2018-09-12 12:44:01 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1482654](attachment.cgi?id=1482654 "Reproducer") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1482654&action=edit "Reproducer") Reproducer  Based on the upstream report.

Working upstream here: <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CDRIVER-2819>, but I'll post the comment here as well.  Looks like we're running off the end of a binary buffer.  Reproducer that triggers the ASAN error can be reduced to: {0x11, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x5, 0xe, 0x19, 0x2e, 0x0, 0x4, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x2, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0}  which I believe decodes to:  0x11, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0 â Length of document is 0x11 (17) bytes 0x5, â binary data 0xe, 0x19, 0x2e, 0x0 â cstr 0x4, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0 â length of binary element (4) 0x2, â binary subtype (Binary (Old)) 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, (Missing final byte)  Thus, if we change the final binary length to a 3 instead of a 4, we no longer trigger the out of bounds read.  Looking at the code now...   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1627923#c5)  Scott Gayou    2018-09-14 18:43:11 UTC  ``` Upstream Patch:  <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-c-driver/commit/0d9a4d98bfdf4acd2c0138d4aaeb4e2e0934bd84>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1627923#c8)  Scott Gayou    2018-09-17 20:41:59 UTC  ``` Created mongo-c-driver tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1630042](show_bug.cgi?id=1630042 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-16790 mongo-c-driver: libbson: Heap-based buffer over-read in _bson_iter_next_internal in bson-iter.c [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1627923#c9)  Petr Pisar    2018-09-18 08:42:40 UTC  ``` EPEL7's libbson-1.3.5 does not manifest this bug because bson_iter_next() does not read the redundant length header of BSON_SUBTYPE_BINARY_DEPRECATED by memcpy(). Otherwise the parser code is the same. I will apply the fix there. Making the parser stricter is not a bad thing.   ``` |  |

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
