{
  "CVE-2018-16287": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application lacks proper validation of file types during the upload process.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Arbitrary File Upload"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can upload any file type, including malicious files, to the server. This could lead to various attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by uploading a malicious HTML/JavaScript file or potentially more severe issues depending on the server's configuration and how uploaded files are handled.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exposed via the web interface of the SuperSign EZ CMS when adding a new template. An attacker can upload a file through the upload functionality.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to access the CMS interface, which might require bypassing authentication. However, after the successful upload, the file can be accessed without authentication via the LFI vulnerability (CVE-2018-16288)."
