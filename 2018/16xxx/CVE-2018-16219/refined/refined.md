Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities present in the AudioCodes 405HD IP phone firmware, as described in the document:

**Vulnerability 1: Admin Password Change Without Authentication**

*   **Root Cause:** The web interface allows changing the admin password via a POST request without requiring prior authentication or knowledge of the current password.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of authentication for password change functionality.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can change the admin password to a value of their choosing. This gains them administrative access to the device's web interface.
*  **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted POST request to the `/mainform.cgi/System_Auth.htm` endpoint.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the device.

**Vulnerability 2: Command Injection**

*   **Root Cause:** The web interface's diagnostic functions (e.g., ping, traceroute) pass user-supplied input to system commands without proper sanitization. The cgi script only checks the prefix of the command but does not prevent additional commands or input.
*   **Weaknesses:** Insufficient sanitization of user input within the `command.cgi` script. Specifically, the failure to sanitize input allows command concatenation via ";".
*   **Impact:** An authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary system commands with root privileges on the device.
*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious commands into the input fields of diagnostic functions in the web interface (e.g., by appending ";<malicious command>" to the command string.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be authenticated to access the diagnostic pages of the web interface.

**Vulnerability 3: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** Input fields in the web interface, such as the contact name and domain name fields, do not properly sanitize JavaScript code, allowing it to be executed within the user's browser.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization on the web interface.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser session when they access the web interface or load manipulated configuration files.
*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting JavaScript code into vulnerable input fields via DHCP server, manipulated configuration files or address book.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to control the DHCP server, manipulate the device's configuration file or address book, or convince an administrator to visit a malicious page.

**Combined Impact (Vulnerability 1 & 2)**

*   **Impact:** Combining vulnerabilities 1 & 2, an unauthenticated attacker on the same network can gain a remote root shell on the device.
    1.  The attacker uses vulnerability 1 to set an admin password.
    2.  The attacker uses the newly set password to access the web interface and use vulnerability 2 to start telnetd on the device.
    3.  The attacker then connects to telnet and gains root access.

**Additional Information**

*   The webserver runs as root, making injected commands execute with root privileges.
