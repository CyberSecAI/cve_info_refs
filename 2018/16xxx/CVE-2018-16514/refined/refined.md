Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-16514:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` in `core/filter_form_api.php` to determine the fallback page URL. This variable is vulnerable to manipulation via crafted URLs, leading to a reflected XSS vulnerability. The initial attempt to sanitize the URL using `string_sanitize_url` was insufficient to prevent the attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Use of `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` for URL generation
- Insufficient input sanitization

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the page, which will be executed within the context of the victim's browser.
- This could allow the attacker to perform actions like stealing cookies, session tokens, or redirecting the user to a malicious website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL with an `onmouseover` attribute injected into the URL parameters, specifically when the filter form is rendered.
- The attack vector is primarily through the `view_filters_page.php` and `manage_filter_edit_page.php` scripts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or access to the system other than the ability to send crafted URLs to a victim.
- The vulnerability is especially exploitable on systems with poorly configured CORS headers or for users of older browsers such as Internet Explorer 10, 11, and potentially Edge, which might not enforce CORS policies strictly.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in both `view_filters_page.php` and `manage_filter_edit_page.php`.
- The fix implemented uses `$_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME']` instead of `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']`, which is not vulnerable to URL manipulation. The fix also uses `helper_mantis_url` to ensure proper URL construction.
- This issue is related to CVE-2018-13055, which had a similar root cause but a different attack vector.
- The vulnerability was fixed in MantisBT version 2.17.1
