{
  "CVE-2018-16877": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient verification of client-side authentication in Pacemaker's client-server communication, combined with other IPC weaknesses.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insufficient local IPC client-server authentication, leading to a 'confused deputy' problem. The client does not properly authenticate the server, making it vulnerable to a malicious server.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Local privilege escalation to root, potentially leading to full cluster control. Information disclosure in log outputs may also occur.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local attacker with access to a cluster node running Pacemaker.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Low privileged user with local access to a Pacemaker node. No user interaction is required."
  },
  "CVE-2018-16878": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Pacemaker's insufficient verification of processes, which can lead to uncontrolled processes being given preference.",
     "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insufficient verification of processes, leading to uncontrolled processes gaining precedence, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS).",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial-of-service (DoS).",
    "Attack vectors": "Local attacker with access to a cluster node running Pacemaker.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Low privileged user with local access to a Pacemaker node. No user interaction is required."
  },
  "CVE-2019-3885": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Use-after-free flaw in Pacemaker's memory handling.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use-after-free vulnerability leading to potential information disclosure through log outputs.",
     "Impact of exploitation": "Potential disclosure of sensitive information in logs.  The system might crash for hitting segmentation fault in the pacemaker-execd daemon. The information disclosure could include standard output of the immediately preceding agent/resource execution leaking into the log stream.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local attacker with access to a cluster node running Pacemaker.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local attacker, with access to the cluster node. No user interaction required"
