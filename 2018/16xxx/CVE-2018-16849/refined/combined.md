| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1645334#c0)  James Hebden    2018-11-02 01:12:48 UTC  ```  The std.ssh action can be used to disclose the presence of arbitrary files within the filesystem of the executor running the action. Since std.ssh private_key_filename can take an absolute path, it can be used to assess whether or not a file exists on the executor's filesystem.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1645334#c1)  James Hebden    2018-11-02 02:59:43 UTC  ``` Upstream bug: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/mistral/+bug/1783708](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mistral/%2Bbug/1783708)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1645334#c3)  James Hebden    2018-11-02 03:31:36 UTC  ``` Example from the upstream bug:  Running: mistral run-action std.ssh '{"cmd":"ls","host":"127.0.0.1","username":"root","private_key_filename":"/notthere"}'  Returns: {"result": "Failed to run action [action_ex_id=None, action_cls='<class 'mistral.actions.action_factory.SSHAction'>', attributes='{}', params='{u'username': u'root', u'host': u'127.0.0.1', u'cmd': u'ls', u'private_key_filename': u'/notthere'}']\n Failed to execute ssh cmd 'ls' on [u'127.0.0.1']\nException: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: u'/notthere'"}  Running: mistral run-action std.ssh '{"cmd":"ls","host":"127.0.0.1","username":"root","private_key_filename":"/etc/passwd"}'  Returns: {"result": "Failed to run action [action_ex_id=None, action_cls='<class 'mistral.actions.action_factory.SSHAction'>', attributes='{}', params='{u'username': u'root', u'host': u'127.0.0.1', u'cmd': u'ls', u'private_key_filename': u'/etc/passwd'}']\n Failed to execute ssh cmd 'ls' on [u'127.0.0.1']\nException: not a valid RSA private key file"}   This can help detect the nature of the underlying system:  For example, to test for the presence of a Fedora release file: mistral run-action std.ssh '{"cmd":"ls","host":"127.0.0.1","username":"root","private_key_filename":"/etc/fedora-release"}' {"result": "Failed to run action [action_ex_id=None, action_cls='<class 'mistral.actions.action_factory.SSHAction'>', attributes='{}', params='{u'username': u'root', u'host': u'127.0.0.1', u'cmd': u'ls', u'private_key_filename': u'/etc/fedora-release'}']\n Failed to execute ssh cmd 'ls' on [u'127.0.0.1']\nException: not a valid RSA private key file"}   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1645334#c6)  Laura Pardo    2019-05-22 15:16:03 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the Mistral project   ``` |  |

### Bug Description

Since std.ssh private\_key\_filename can take an absolute path, it can be used to assess whether or not a file exists on the executor's filesystem:

mistral run-action std.ssh '{"cmd":"ls","host":"127.0.0.1","username":"root","private\_key\_filename":"/notthere"}'

{"result": "Failed to run action [action\_ex\_id=None, action\_cls='<class 'mistral.actions.action\_factory.SSHAction'>', attributes='{}', params='{u'username': u'root', u'host': u'127.0.0.1', u'cmd': u'ls', u'private\_key\_filename': u'/notthere'}']\n Failed to execute ssh cmd

'ls' on [u'127.0.0.1']\nException: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: u'/notthere'"}

mistral run-action std.ssh '{"cmd":"ls","host":"127.0.0.1","username":"root","private\_key\_filename":"/etc/passwd"}'

{"result": "Failed to run action [action\_ex\_id=None, action\_cls='<class 'mistral.actions.action\_factory.SSHAction'>', attributes='{}', params='{u'username': u'root', u'host': u'127.0.0.1', u'cmd': u'ls', u'private\_key\_filename': u'/etc/passwd'}']\n Failed to execute ssh cmd 'ls' on [u'127.0.0.1']\nException: not a valid RSA private key file"}

This can help detect the nature of the underlying system:

mistral run-action std.ssh '{"cmd":"ls","host":"127.0.0.1","username":"root","private\_key\_filename":"/etc/debian\_version"}'

{"result": "Failed to run action [action\_ex\_id=None, action\_cls='<class 'mistral.actions.action\_factory.SSHAction'>', attributes='{}', params='{u'username': u'root', u'host': u'127.0.0.1', u'cmd': u'ls', u'private\_key\_filename': u'/etc/debian\_version'}']\n Failed to execute ssh cmd 'ls' on [u'127.0.0.1']\nException: not a valid RSA private key file"}

-> Hello Debian based system!

This behavior is not present in pike (haven't tested versions in between pike and master) because it does not allow absolute path.

I only see two options out of this problem:

1) Remove the possibility to use absolute path but this might break stuff

2) Put a generic error message for both (file does not exist or file exists but is not a valid key) that does not disclose the existence of the file. Something like "Cannot use private key [...]"

We use paramiko for SSH, I wonder if a more recent version changed the error, exposing more information.

The same error will probably happen in an older version of paramiko but this is less a problem since the path cannot escape /var/lib/mistral

Pike has

paramiko>=2.0 # LGPLv2.1+

Master has

paramiko>=2.0.0 # LGPLv2.1+

So I don't think it is paramiko version related. I think it is related to the patch that passes on the result to the cli. We used to answer only "App: 500 failed" and now we are returning the full error message.

I think the best solution is to return generic failed messages for std.ssh
