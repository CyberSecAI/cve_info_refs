  "CVE-2018-16864": {
    "description": "systemd: stack overflow when calling syslog from a command with long cmdline",
    "root_cause": "A stack overflow vulnerability exists in systemd's journald component when a program with long command line arguments calls syslog(). The `strjoina` function allocates memory on the stack based on the length of the command line arguments, without proper size checks, leading to a stack overflow if the arguments are too long.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Stack overflow due to unbounded stack allocation",
      "Memory corruption due to writing past allocated stack memory"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can crash systemd-journald or potentially execute arbitrary code by exploiting this stack overflow.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local exploitation by a process calling syslog with overly long command line arguments",
          "Remote exploitation if systemd-journal-remote is in use."

  "CVE-2018-16865": {
    "description": "systemd: stack overflow when receiving many journald entries",
      "root_cause": "A stack overflow vulnerability exists in systemd's journald component when receiving many journal entries. The `journal_file_append_entry` function allocates memory on the stack to store message fields, and this memory allocation is based on user-controlled input `n_iovec` without size validation, which allows an attacker to trigger a stack overflow by sending an excessive number of log entries to the journal socket.",

    "description": "systemd: out-of-bounds read in journald",
    "root_cause": "An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in systemd-journald in the `syslog_parse_identifier` function.  When parsing a syslog message with a colon as the last character in the identifier, the code reads past the null terminator of the string leading to an information leak.",
