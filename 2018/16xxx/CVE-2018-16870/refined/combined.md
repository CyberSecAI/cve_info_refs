*‘‘Those who’ll play with cats must expect to be scratched.’’ – Miguel de Cervantes, *Don Quixote*.*

# Abstract

At CRYPTO'98, Bleichenbacher published his seminal paper which described a padding oracle attack against RSA implementations that follow the PKCS #1 v1.5 standard.

Over the last twenty years researchers and implementors had spent
a huge amount of effort in developing and deploying numerous mitigation
techniques which were supposed to plug all the possible sources of
Bleichenbacher-like leakages. However, as we show in this paper most
implementations are still vulnerable to several novel types of attack based
on leakage from various microarchitectural side channels: Out of nine popular
implementations of TLS that we tested, we were able to break the security of
seven implementations with practical proof-of-concept attacks. We demonstrate
the feasibility of using those Cache-like ATacks (CATs) to perform a
downgrade attack against any TLS connection to a vulnerable server, using a
BEAST-like Man in the Browser attack.

The main difficulty we face is how to
perform the thousands of oracle queries required before the browser’s imposed
timeout (which is 30 seconds for almost all browsers, with the exception of
Firefox which can be tricked into extending this period). The attack seems to
be inherently sequential (due to its use of adaptive chosen ciphertext
queries), but we describe a new way to parallelize Bleichenbacher-like
padding attacks by exploiting any available number of TLS servers that share
the same public key certificate.

With this improvement, we could demonstrate
the feasibility of a downgrade attack which could recover all the 2048 bits
of the RSA plaintext (including the premaster secret value, which suffices to
establish a secure connection) from five available TLS servers in under 30
seconds. This sequential-to-parallel transformation of such attacks can be
of independent interest, speeding up and facilitating other side channel
attacks on RSA implementations.

## Acknowledgments

The authors would like to thank [Orr Dunkelman](http://www.cs.haifa.ac.il/~orrd/) for his contribution, in
particular for his insights about the parallelization of the attack using LLL.

[@SparkiDev](https://github.com/SparkiDev) : Code changes look good. Found a missing XFREE case that needs fixed. Also can you describe the purpose of `TEST_UNPAD_CONSTANT_TIME` and how to use it? Perhaps you can also send Todd and I an email about how you validated this was constant time? Thanks

The `XFREE` for `t` appears to be missing for the small stack case?
