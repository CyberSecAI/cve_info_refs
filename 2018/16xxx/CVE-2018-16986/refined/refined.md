      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is triggered by a specific bit in the header of a BLE advertising packet, causing the chip to allocate more memory than needed leading to a memory overflow. ",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper memory allocation in BLE chip when processing advertising packets",
        "Lack of proper input validation on BLE advertising packets."

      "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the mishandling of BLE advertising packets. The function `llGetAdvChanPDU` incorrectly parses packet headers, resulting in an incorrect length being used. This leads to copying the packet into a buffer that is too small, leading to a heap overflow.",

        "Improper handling of BLE advertising packets length.",
        "Memory corruption due to heap overflow."

       "impact": "Remote code execution on the BLE chip. Attackers can control data of the overflow and length, potentially leading to code execution on the main CPU and impact other network devices.",
       "attack_vectors": "Physical proximity is needed. Crafted BLE packets can trigger the vulnerability when the device is in scanning mode.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be within physical proximity to the target device while it is in scanning mode."
