"title": "Summary",
"text": "On November 1st, 2018, Armis announced the presence of a Remote Code Execution (RCE) or Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability in the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Stack on Texas Instruments (TI) chips CC2640 and CC2650. This vulnerability has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID of CVE-2018-16986.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a memory corruption condition that may occur when processing malformed BLE frames. An attacker in close proximity to an affected device that is actively scanning could exploit the issue by broadcasting malformed BLE frames. A successful exploit may result in the attacker gaining the ability to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service condition on an affected device.\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181101-ap [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181101-ap\"]"

To determine if a device supports BLE, the administrator can issue the show controllers bleRadio 0 interface command. If the command is not recognized or the error message BLE not supported on this platform is displayed, the Access Point does not support BLE and is considered not vulnerable.\r\n\r\n\r\nap# show controllers bleRadio 0 interface\r\n% Unrecognized command\r\n\r\n\r\nap# show controllers bleRadio 0 interface\r\nBLE not supported on this platform\r\n\r\nDetermining if the Cisco Aironet Access Point with BLE Support is Vulnerable\r\nIf a Cisco Aironet Access Point does support BLE, it is only vulnerable if BLE is active and BLE scan mode is enabled (BLE scan mode is disabled by default). The administrator can issue the show controllers bleRadio 0 interface command and if the Device Status is Unknown the Access Point is not vulnerable.\r\n\r\n\r\nap# show controllers bleRadio 0 interface\r\n\r\nActive BLE host interface : /dev/ttyMSM1\r\nDevice Status : Unknown\r\nDevice resets : 0\r\nHeart beat status : Off\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Aironet Access Points have BLE scan mode disabled by default. The administrator can issue show controllers bleRadio 0 timers and if the Scan timer status is Not Running, the Access Point is not vulnerable.\r\n\r\n\r\nap# show controllers bleRadio 0 timers\r\n\r\nTimers\r\n------\r\nScan timer status : Not Running\r\n\r\nIn addition, if the administrator issues the show controllers bleRadio 0 scan brief and there are no entries displayed, the Access Point is not vulnerable.\r\n\r\n\r\nap# show controllers bleRadio 0 scan brief\r\nProfile MAC RSSI(-dBm) RSSI@1meter(-dBm) Last-heard\r\n\r\nDetermining the BLE Status from the WLC Controller The administrator can also issue the WLC controller command show advanced ble summary to get the BLE status of the Access Point from the WLC controller.\r\n\r\nwlc# show advanced ble summary\r\nGlobal BLE Mgmt Admin State: DOWN\r\nBLE summary for all APs\r\nAP Name Interface Admin State Operation State\r\n-------------------------- --------- ----------- ---------------\r\nap1800i-r2sw1-te-1-0-11 Integrated DOWN Non Operational\r\nap3800i\_r2-sw1-Te1-0-5 USB dongle DOWN Non Operational\r\n\r\nDetermining the Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software release is running on a device, administrators can use the controller’s web interface or the CLI.\r\n\r\nTo use the web interface, do the following:\r\n\r\nIn a browser, log in to the controller’s web interface\r\nClick the Monitor tab\r\nClick Summary in the left pane\r\nUnder Controller Summary, the Software Version field shows the release number of the software that is currently running on the device\r\n\r\nTo use the CLI, log in to the controller via Telnet, issue the show sysinfo command, and then refer to the value in the Product Version field of the command output. The following example shows the command output for a device that is running Cisco WLC Software Release 8.7.106.0:\r\n\r\n\r\n(wlc)> show sysinfo\r\n\r\nManufacturer's Name.............................. Cisco Systems Inc.\r\nProduct Name.....................................

# Exposes Enterprise Access Points and Unmanaged Devices to Undetectable Chip Level Attack

### General Overview

Armis has identified two chip-level vulnerabilities impacting access points and potentially other unmanaged devices. Dubbed “BLEEDINGBIT,” they are two critical vulnerabilities related to the use of BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) chips made by Texas Instruments (TI). The chips are embedded in, among other devices, certain access points that deliver Wi-Fi to enterprise networks manufactured by Cisco, Meraki and Aruba. These are the leaders in networking, and accounting for nearly 70% of the market. Armis research focused on these network devices. These proximity-based vulnerabilities allow an unauthenticated attacker to break into enterprise networks undetected. Once an attacker takes control over an access point, he can move laterally between network segments, and create a bridge between them — effectively breaking network segmentation. Armis has reported the issues to TI and the affected vendors above. We are also working with additional vendors of various connected devices to ascertain whether they, too, are affected by the BLEEDINGBIT vulnerabilities.

### Why It Matters

Both vulnerabilities identified by Armis relate to the use BLE chips, which are gaining ground with an increasing amount of applications across industries. The relatively new BLE protocol is based on the established Bluetooth protocol, but goes much further by creating closely knit networks and enabling many of the novel uses of IoT devices. Besides being used in networking devices such as access points, medical centers use BLE to track the location of beacons on valuable assets like resuscitation carts. Retailers use BLE for point of sales devices, as well as indoor navigation applications. BLE is also used in new smart locks used by hotel chains, offices, and smart homes; even in cars.

BLE chips provide new features, but also introduce new risks that expand the attack surface. This is especially true in the case of network devices, such as access points which distribute Wi-Fi on an enterprise scale, and incorporate BLE chips to allow new functionalities. In doing so, they become susceptible to a new range of chip-based vulnerabilities, endangering the integrity of the networks they serve. It is important to note that access points were already affected by over-the-air vulnerabilities in their embedded Wi-Fi chips which, unlike the BLE chips, have already been thoroughly vetted, making them less prone to such vulnerabilities. Although the vulnerabilities identified in this report require the BLE chip to be on, they provide a new attack surface.

Armis continues to gauge the full reach of the vulnerabilities.

### The Unmanaged Device Challenge

The BLEEDINGBIT vulnerabilities shed light on two major unaddressed issues in cybersecurity: the poorly secured networking infrastructure devices, and the embedding and use of hardware and software developed by 3rd party vendors in products.

### Network Devices Are Unmanaged Devices

Network devices are a unique phenomenon in today’s cyber landscape. Even though they handle all of the crucial information we wish to protect, they have little or no protections themselves, especially when compared to PCs and mobile devices. While PCs and mobile platforms have well founded operating systems (OSs) which include inherent mitigations, network devices have only a limited OS if any, with very little mitigations in place. This makes it much easier to exploit vulnerabilities found in them, while in PC and mobile such vulnerabilities are often unreachable and thus pose no real threat. Furthermore, while other platforms are protected by endpoint security measures forged by years of experience in the fight against cyber threats, network devices aren’t protected by such security measures. As a result, network devices are an extremely valuable prize for hackers, as they provide full access to the desired information, with very little defenses to defeat in the way.

### The Need for Peripheral Vision

Another issue exposed by the vulnerabilities is the use of hardware and software developed by 3rd party vendors. Most vendors embed various chips which were not developed by them, and therefore have limited capabilities to control and vet them. By embedding these “blackboxes,” the vendors allow potential vulnerabilities to affect their devices, without their knowledge or providing adequate precautionary measures.

While chips serving Wi-Fi, BLE, or any other wireless protocol may seem peripheral, they too run code which can include vulnerabilities. When found, these vulnerabilities provide attackers with a bridgehead, from which they can easily spread to the main processor and take over the entire device. This is possible since the defenses between different components of the device is more lax than the external ones. In some cases, these chips may also be the main processor of the device, meaning that exploiting it would directly lead to full control over it.

Vendors might also misinterpret or misuse chips which were not developed by them, causing security issue such as the OAD BLEEDINGBIT vulnerability we identified.

### An Unauthenticated and Undetected Attack

BLEEDINGBIT is the latest addition to the growing number of airborne threats, such as BlueBorne, KRACK Attack, the Broadcom vulnerabilities and several others. As the BLEEDINGBIT vulnerabilities affect the BLE chips, responsible for wireless communication, they can be exploited remotely, via the air, unlike most attacks conducted through the Internet. This allows an unauthenticated perpetrator to penetrate a secure network of which he is not a member. Airborne attacks are beneficial to attackers for several reasons. First, they allow them to operate virtually undetected, as traditional security measures cannot detect them. Second, they are contagious by their nature, allowing the attack to spread to any device in the vicinity of the initial breach.

### Network Segmentation Is At Risk in the IoT Age

Enterprises have long used network segmentation as a strategy to control access to important resources. Corporate-owned “trusted” computers are allowed onto the corporate network, using authentication protocols, and whitelisting devices like printers and few others. All other devices (BYOD and IoT) are placed on guest networks or separate VLANs. However, the segmentation itself relies upon unmanaged and loosely guarded network devices which implement it. Attacks such as BLEEDINGBIT, which target these devices can effectively bypass network segmentation. Once attackers control the network devices, they gain simultaneous access to all network segments and can even eliminate segmentation altogether, proving enterprises cannot depend on network segmentation alone.

### Who’s At Risk?

First and foremost, the BLEEDINGBIT vulnerabilities endanger enterprises using vulnerable access points in their networks. Beyond access points, the health sector is potentially affected by these vulnerabilities, as the affected BLE chips are used in many medical devices, such as insulin pumps and pacemakers. Even private users might be affected by the vulnerabilities if they use an IoT device which embeds one of the vulnerable chips. Armis is still in the midst of evaluating the full effects of BLEEDINGBIT on devices serving multiple sectors.

Aside from the devices listed above, we are not aware of networking equipment that is affected. However, the investigation is still in process, and we advise visiting the CERT/CC advisory page for the latest information.

**Disclosure Process**

Armis has contacted various vendors who might be affected, as well as the manufacturer of the vulnerable chips, and the CERT/CC to try and identify all potentially affected devices. We strongly advise all companies using on of the vulnerable chips in these devices to verify whether the BLEEDINGBIT vulnerabilities affect them, and invite them to contact us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) and use our pgp key to send an encrypted report, so we can assist in the process.

**BLEEDINGBIT RCE vulnerability (CVE-2018-16986)**

Armis contacted Texas Instruments on June 20, 2018. Through our discussions, it was discovered that TI was familiar with the bug causing the vulnerability, and issued a fix in BLE-STACK 2.2.2. However, Armis identified it as a security issue. Once notified, the companies worked together to issue the appropriate updates to the patch, and coordinate the announcements. Cisco was notified on July 24, 2018 of the issue.

**BLEEDINGBIT OAD RCE vulnerability (CVE-2018-7080)**

Armis also contacted TI about the OAD vulnerability. TI indicated that the OAD feature should not be used by vendors in the production of devices in the first place. On July 9, Armis reported the issue to Aruba, which used the feature in access points it manufactured.

### Technical Overview

#### How do the BLEEDINGBIT vulnerabilities work?

**BLEEDINGBIT RCE vulnerability (CVE-2018-16986)**

The first BLEEDINGBIT RCE (Remote Code Execution) vulnerability resides in a TI chip embedded in many devices. Our research focused on access points. The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker in the vicinity of the affected device, provided its BLE is turned on, without any other prerequisites or knowledge about the device. First, the attacker sends multiple benign BLE broadcast messages, called “advertising packets,” which will be stored on the memory of the vulnerable BLE chip in targeted device. While the packets are not harmful, they contain code that will be invoked by the attacker later on. This activity will be undetected by traditional security solutions.

Next, the attacker sends the overflow packet, which is a standard advertising packet with a subtle alteration – a specific bit in its header turned ON instead of off. This bit causes the chip to allocate the information from the packet a much larger space than it really needs, triggering an overflow of critical memory in the process. The leaked memory contains function pointers – memory that points to specific code segments, which the attacker can leverage to point to the code s/he sent to the vulnerable chip in the previous stage of the attack.

At this point, the attacker can run malicious code on the targeted device, and install a backdoor on the vulnerable chip, which will await further commands transmitted over BLE. The attacker can also change the behavior of the BLE chip and attack the main processor of the device, gaining full control over it. In the case of an access point, once the attacker gained control he can reach all networks served by it, regardless of any network segmentation. Furthermore, the attacker can use the device in his control to spread laterally to any other device in its vicinity, launching a truly airborne attack.

Here is an example of a takeover of a BLE chip on a Cisco Access Point 1815w using a TI cc2640 BLE chip.

BLEEDINGBIT OAD RCE vulnerability (CVE-2018-7080)

The second BLEEDINGBIT vulnerability was specific to the Aruba Access Point Series 300, and its use of the OAD (Over the Air firmware Download) feature from TI. This issue is technically a backdoor in BLE chips that was designed to allow firmware updates. The OAD feature is often used as a development tool, but is active in some production access points. It can allow a nearby attacker to access and install a completely new and different version of the firmware — effectively rewriting the operating system of the BLE chip, if not implemented correctly by the manufacturer.

By default, the OAD feature is not automatically configured to address secure firmware updates. It allows a simple update mechanism of the firmware running on the BLE chip over a GATT transaction. In the case of Aruba’s access points, a hardcoded password was added (that is identical across all Aruba APs that support BLE) to prevent the OAD feature of being easily abused by attackers.

However, an attacker who acquired the password by sniffing a legitimate update or by reverse-engineering Aruba’s BLE firmware can connect to the BLE chip on a vulnerable access point and upload a malicious firmware containing the attacker’s own code, effectively allowing a completely rewrite its operating system, thereby gaining full control over it. From this point, the malicious potential is identical to that achieved by the first vulnerability.

Here is an example of a takeover of an Aruba Access Point 325 using a TI cc2540 BLE chip.

**Securing against BLEEDINGBIT**

For CVE-2018-16986, the TI BLE-STACK update has been released and is publically available to customers here.

* For customers using CC2640 (non-R2) and CC2650 with BLE-STACK version 2.2.1 or earlier: update to version 2.2.2.
* For customers using CC2640R2F, with SimpleLink CC2640R2 SDK version 1.00.00.22 (BLE-STACK 3.0.0): update to SimpleLink CC2640R2F SDK version 1.30.00.25 (BLE-STACK 3.0.1) or later.
* For customers using CC1350, with SimpleLink CC13x0 SDK version 2.20.00.38 (BLE-STACK 2.3.3) or earlier: update to SimpleLink CC13x0 SDK version 2.30.00.20 (BLE-STACK 2.3.4) or later.

Customers using these devices, software and scanning mode combinations should determine whether their application is affected based on how it is being used, and whether software updates are possible within their end application. The level of action needed will likely vary depending on the use-case of each end-product.

For TI Customer Support, questions on this issue should be directed to contact points for [technical support for the BLE-STACK here](http://www.ti.com/tool/BLE-STACK).

For CVE-2018-7080, it is recommended you ensure the OAD functionality is not active in live, production environments without the proper security addressed.

Vulnerabilities which allow attackers to spread over the air between devices pose a tremendous threat to any organization or individual. Current security measures, including endpoint protection, mobile data management, firewalls, and network security solution are not designed to identify these type of attacks, and related vulnerabilities and exploits, as their main focus is to block attacks that can spread via IP connections.

New solutions are needed to address the new airborne attack vector, especially those that make air gapping and network segmentation irrelevant. Additionally, there will need to be more attention and research as new protocols are using for consumers and businesses alike. With the large number of desktop, mobile, and IoT devices only increasing, it is critical we can ensure these types of vulnerabilities are not exploited. This is the primary mission of Armis in this new connected device age.

## Texas Instruments CC2640 and CC2650 microcontrollers vulnerable to heap overflow and insecure update

#### Vulnerability Note VU#317277

Original Release Date: 2018-11-01 | Last Revised: 2019-01-07

---

### Overview

Texas Instruments CC2640 and CC2650 microcontrollers are vulnerable to a heap overflow and may allow unauthenticated firmware installation.

### Description

| **C****WE-119:** **Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffe****r**  CVE-2018-16986 - also known as BLEEDINGBITThe following Texas Instrument chips are affected:   * CC2640 (non-R2) with BLE-STACK version 2.2.1 or an earlier version * CC2650 with BLE-STACK version 2.2.1 or an earlier version * CC2640R2F with SimpleLink CC2640R2 SDK version 1.00.00.22 (BLE-STACK 3.0.0) * CC1350 with SimpleLink CC13x0 SDK version 2.20.00.38 (BLE-STACK 2.3.3) or an earlier version  The above Texas Instruments controllers contain BLE-Stacks with a memory corruption vulnerability resulting from the mishandling of BLE advertising packets. The function llGetAdvChanPDU that is part of the embedded ROM image in both chips handles the incoming advertising packets and parses their headers. It copies the contents to a separate buffer provided by the calling function. The incorrect length of the packet is taken and ends up being parsed as larger packets than originally intended. If the incoming data is over a certain length, the function will call the halAssertHandler function, as defined by the application running on top of the stack, and not stop execution. Since the flow of execution does not stop, it will copy the overly large packet to the buffer and cause a heap overflow.CVE-2018-7080 - also known as BLEEDINGBITThe following Texas Instruments devices are affected if the Over the Air firmware Download ([OAD](http://dev.ti.com/tirex/content/simplelink_cc2640r2_sdk_2_30_00_28/docs/blestack/ble_user_guide/html/ble3-stack-oad/index-ble3-cc2640.html)) feature is enabled and not sufficiently secured:  * CC2642R * CC2640R2 * CC2640 * CC2650 * CC2540 * CC2541 * Certain Aruba access points are [affected](https://www.arubanetworks.com/assets/alert/ARUBA-PSA-2018-006.txt).  The OAD feature allows for remote firmware updates of some BLE chips. An attacker could connect to a BLE chip on a vulnerable access point (either without authentication or by obtaining the password through other means depending on the implementation) and upload their own malicious firmware, which could give them complete control over the access point. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Using a specially crafted set of packets, an attacker can both control the data of the overflow, and the length of it, which may lead to remote code execution on the targeted BLE chip. An attacker needs to be within physical proximity to the device while it is in scanning mode to trigger vulnerable code. This memory corruption can lead to code execution on the main CPU of the device, which could have the potential to affect other devices across a network if the origin is a networked device. An attacker could also exploit this vulnerability to rewrite the operating system of a device and gain full control over it.Given the nature of embedded devices, it is possible that a broader set of devices are impacted than what is listed in this publication. If you believe you are affected, please email us at cert@cert.org. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update the BLE-Stack**This vulnerability was patched in BLE-Stack v2.2.2 released by Texas Instruments on March 28, 2018. Affected devices will require a firmware update to obtain the updated BLE-Stack.**Do not use the OAD feature in production**The OAD featrure is never meant to be used in production, so manufacturers should ensure that this feature is not enabled by default in live environments. |

To determine if a device supports BLE, the administrator can issue the **show controllers bleRadio 0 interface** command. If the command is not recognized or the error message **BLE not supported on this platform** is displayed, the Access Point does not support BLE and is considered not vulnerable.  ```   ap# show controllers bleRadio 0 interface   % Unrecognized command   ```  ```   ap# show controllers bleRadio 0 interface   BLE not supported on this platform   ``` Determining if the Cisco Aironet Access Point with BLE Support is Vulnerable If a Cisco Aironet Access Point does support BLE, it is only vulnerable if BLE is active and BLE scan mode is enabled (BLE scan mode is disabled by default). The administrator can issue the **show controllers bleRadio 0 interface** command and if the **Device Status** is **Unknown** the Access Point is not vulnerable.  ```   ap# show controllers bleRadio 0 interfaceActive BLE host interface       : /dev/ttyMSM1Device Status                   : UnknownDevice resets                   : 0Heart beat status               : Off   ```  The Cisco Aironet Access Points have BLE scan mode disabled by default. The administrator can issue **show controllers bleRadio 0 timers** and if the **Scan timer status** is **Not Running**, the Access Point is not vulnerable.  ```   ap# show controllers bleRadio 0 timersTimers------Scan timer status       : Not Running   ```  In addition, if the administrator issues the **show controllers bleRadio 0 scan brief** and there are no entries displayed, the Access Point is not vulnerable.  ```   ap# show controllers bleRadio 0 scan brief   Profile MAC  RSSI(-dBm)  RSSI@1meter(-dBm)  Last-heard   ``` Determining the BLE Status from the WLC ControllerThe administrator can also issue the WLC controller command **show advanced ble summary** to get the BLE status of the Access Point from the WLC controller.    ```   wlc# show advanced ble summaryGlobal BLE Mgmt Admin State: DOWN   BLE summary for all APs   AP Name                       Interface        Admin State  Operation State --------------------------    ---------        -----------  ---------------ap1800i-r2sw1-te-1-0-11       Integrated       DOWN         Non Operational    ap3800i_r2-sw1-Te1-0-5        USB dongle       DOWN         Non Operational   ```      Determining the Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Software Release To determine which Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software release is running on a device, administrators can use the controller’s web interface or the CLI.  To use the web interface, do the following:    1. In a browser, log in to the controller’s web interface   2. Click the **Monitor** tab   3. Click **Summary** in the left pane   4. Under **Controller Summary**, the **Software Version** field shows the release number of the software that is currently running on the device To use the CLI, log in to the controller via Telnet, issue the **show sysinfo** command, and then refer to the value in the **Product Version** field of the command output. The following example shows the command output for a device that is running Cisco WLC Software Release 8.7.106.0:  ```   (wlc)> show sysinfoManufacturer's Name.............................. Cisco Systems Inc.Product Name.....................................

| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 8.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.8 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 8.8 |
