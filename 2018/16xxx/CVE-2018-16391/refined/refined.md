Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-16391:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking when handling responses from Muscle Cards within the `muscle_list_files()` function in `card-muscle.c`. Specifically, the `bufLen` variable, which represents the available buffer space, isn't checked, leading to out-of-bounds writes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow. The code copies data into a buffer (`buf`) without verifying if there's enough space available, potentially writing past the buffer's boundaries.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service:** Exploiting this vulnerability could lead to a denial of service by causing the application to crash.
- **Unspecified Other Impact:** The advisory mentions the possibility of "unspecified other impact," suggesting that the vulnerability might be exploitable for more severe consequences.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Malicious Smartcards:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by using specially crafted smartcards that send malformed responses when interacted with via the OpenSC library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Physical Access:** Attackers would need to have the ability to supply crafted smartcards and interact with the system running OpenSC to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code resides in `src/libopensc/card-muscle.c` inside function `muscle_list_files()`
- The code iterates through cached file objects and copies object ID to the buffer `buf`.
- The loop continues and `buf` pointer is incremented without proper check on remaining size `bufLen`.
- If more files are present on the card than the provided `buf` can hold, the `memcpy` will write out of the `buf` bounds.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Eric Sesterhenn from X41 D-SEC GmbH.
- The fix for this vulnerability involves adding a check if `bufLen < 2` and limiting the `memcpy` to the available space.
- This CVE is associated with multiple other vulnerabilities in OpenSC that were discovered around the same time.
