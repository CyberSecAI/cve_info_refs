The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities in the XBTIT torrent tracker software. One of these vulnerabilities is CVE-2018-16361.

**CVE-2018-16361:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `id` parameter in the news edit page is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the news edit page.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the browser of an authenticated user, potentially stealing cookies (including the session cookie), leading to session hijacking and further compromise.
*   **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL that includes a JavaScript payload in the `id` parameter. An authenticated user clicking the link will trigger the malicious script.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick an authenticated user into clicking on it. The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the application. The attacker needs to know a valid news item id for the attack to be successful.
