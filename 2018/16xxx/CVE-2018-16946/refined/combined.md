# LG Smart IP Camera Backup Download

```
#==========================================================================#
# Exploit Title: LG Smart IP Device Backup Download
# Date: 09-11-2018
# Exploit Author: Ege Balcı
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.lg.com
# Model: LNB*/LND*/LNU*/LNV*
# CVE: CVE-2018-16946
#==========================================================================#

```

LG smart network camera devices are suffering from a broken access control vulnerability. Attackers are able to download certain log and backup files without authenticating into the system. Subject backup files contain user credentials and configuration information for the camera device. A malicious attacker is able to find the out the backup file name via reading the system logs, report data or just by brute-forcing the backup file name pattern.

[Known Affected Product List](https://github.com/egebalci/LG-Smart-IP-Device-Backup-Download/blob/master/affected_products.txt)

## POC

Following POC exploit bruteforces the backup file name and extracts the users.

[![usage](https://github.com/egebalci/LG-Smart-IP-Device-Backup-Download/raw/master/Screenshot_4.png)](https://github.com/egebalci/LG-Smart-IP-Device-Backup-Download/raw/master/Screenshot_4.png)

## Reproduce

Once the target camera user clicks on the "View Report" button inside "Log & Report" page, the subject device generates a system report information file under `/updownload/t.report`. This file can be downloaded directly without authenticating to system.

[![report](https://github.com/egebalci/LG-Smart-IP-Device-Backup-Download/raw/master/Screenshot_1.png)](https://github.com/egebalci/LG-Smart-IP-Device-Backup-Download/raw/master/Screenshot_1.png)

This file contains information about the model ID and the version number of the target camera device. When the target camera user generates a system configuration backup by clicking the "Backup" button inside the maintenance page system uses the model ID, version number and the current date to name the backup file. With gathering those information by reading the report data or just by brute forcing the backup file name pattern with publicly known product information, attackers are able to download the backup files with using the `download.php?file=` endpoint.

Backup file is a compressed sqlite database system configuration informations can be extracted with using sqlite browsers.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
