{
  "CVE-2018-16517": {
    "Description": "asm/labels.c in Netwide Assembler (NASM) is prone to NULL Pointer Dereference, which allows the attacker to cause a denial of service via a crafted file.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the `insn_is_label` variable remaining FALSE in certain conditions, leading to `result->label` being assigned to NULL. This NULL value is then dereferenced in the `islocal()` function, resulting in a crash.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "NULL Pointer Dereference"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service. The application crashes due to a NULL pointer dereference.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Crafted input file"
     ],
    "Required capabilities": "Attacker needs to provide a specially crafted assembly file as input to the NASM assembler."
  }
