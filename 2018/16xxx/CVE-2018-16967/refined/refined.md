Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-16967:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization of the `public_path` parameter within the "File Manager" WordPress plugin. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. By injecting a malicious script into the `public_path` parameter, the script is stored in the database and executed when the page is loaded.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The exploit also leverages a CSRF vulnerability. The attacker crafts a form that, when submitted by a logged-in administrator, will modify the `public_path` field with malicious input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This allows the attacker to perform various malicious activities such as:
  - Stealing session cookies.
  - Defacing the website.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Performing administrative actions on behalf of the victim.
  - Access sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious HTML form containing the XSS payload in the `public_path` parameter.
- The attacker then tricks a logged-in WordPress administrator into submitting the form, thus storing the payload.
- When the administrator or any user accesses the page where this setting is displayed, the stored XSS payload will be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious HTML file.
- The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into accessing the malicious HTML page and submitting the form, or find other means of submitting the crafted form.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable plugin is the "File Manager" plugin for WordPress, specifically version 3.0.
- The provided exploit uses an HTML form with a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp_file_manager_root` and includes the XSS payload within the `public_path` parameter.
- The payload used is a simple `<script>alert(2);</script>` demonstrating the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript.
- This vulnerability was discovered on September 11, 2018.
