{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `cac_get_serial_nr_from_CUID` function within the `card-cac.c` file of the OpenSC library. The vulnerability occurs due to an incorrect usage of `memcpy`, where the length of the source buffer (`priv->cac_id_len`) is used instead of the destination buffer (`serial->len`). This can lead to an out-of-bounds write when the source data is larger than the destination buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Buffer Overflow",
    "Out-of-bounds write"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial of service (application crash) or potentially other unspecified impacts. The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a crafted smartcard that sends a large response to the vulnerable function.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves supplying a crafted smart card that will trigger the vulnerable code path when the application interacts with it. This requires the attacker to be able to supply the crafted smartcard to the system using the OpenSC library.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be in a position to supply a crafted smartcard to a system that is using the vulnerable OpenSC library."
