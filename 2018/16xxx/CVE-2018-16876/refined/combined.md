# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1109957#c0)  Stephan Schöttl   2018-09-27 07:36:49 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 784433](attachment.cgi?id=784433 "Example ansible playbook to reproduce the issue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=784433&action=edit "Example ansible playbook to reproduce the issue") Example ansible playbook to reproduce the issue  The firewalld module of ansible fails with "An exception occurred during task execution. To see the full traceback, use -vvv. The error was: NameError: global name 'fw_offline' is not defined". The patch from  <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/38161> (backport for ansible 2.5) is not sufficient. From my first analysis /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible/modules/system/firewalld.py tries "import firewall.config" which fails because firewall.config is only available for python3 (at least I cannot find it). I am attaching a simple example to reproduce (ansible-playbook firewall.yml).  rpm -q ansible ansible-2.5.1-lp150.1.1.noarch  cat /etc/os-release  NAME="openSUSE Leap" VERSION="15.0" ID="opensuse-leap" ID_LIKE="suse opensuse" VERSION_ID="15.0" PRETTY_NAME="openSUSE Leap 15.0" ANSI_COLOR="0;32" CPE_NAME="cpe:/o:opensuse:leap:15.0" BUG_REPORT_URL="<https://bugs.opensuse.org>" HOME_URL="<https://www.opensuse.org/>" ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1109957#c1)  Lars Vogdt   2019-03-15 18:37:18 UTC  ``` Looks to me like the issue if fixed in latest ansible 2.7.8 (if you want, try the package from the development repository in systemsmanagement).  @Maintenance: as there are a lot of other fixes included in the latest version, I like to release the 2.7.8 one as maintenance update for  * openSUSE:Backports:SLE-12/ansible * openSUSE:Backports:SLE-15:Update/ansible * openSUSE:Leap:15.0:Update/ansible * openSUSE:Leap:15.1:Update/ansible * openSUSE:Leap:42.3:Update/ansible if you agree.  There are some configuration settings, that are meanwhile marked as "deprecated" and this will result in a warning message once the user executes his ansible playbooks, but I assume that at least the following CVE (and other) fixes are worth this small inconvenience: * CVE-2018-16876 * CVE-2018-16859 * CVE-2018-10875 * CVE-2018-10855 ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1109957#c2)  Marcus Meissner   2019-03-16 07:02:00 UTC  ``` would be fine for me. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1109957#c3)  Lars Vogdt   2019-03-16 22:28:33 UTC  ``` (In reply to Marcus Meissner from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1109957#c2)) > would be fine for me.  <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/685668> created.  @Maintenance: sorry to disturb, but it's unclear to me when to mark a bug as fixed?

##### SUMMARY

become\_plugins using the CLIARGS context so we don't have to pass options around everywhere

##### ISSUE TYPE

* Feature Pull Request

##### COMPONENT NAME

become plugins

##### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

The main thing yet to do is to get rid of `play.Play._set_from_CLI_options` and `base.FieldAttributeBase._set_options`. Those should be implemented via `FieldAttribute` defaults instead.

This is built on top of [#50069](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/50069) which should be merged first.

Sorry, something went wrong.

a few minor things around dep warnings for the remaining play\_context attrs (yeah, right, we'll go back and add dep warnings in the next release ;) ), otherwise LGTM

Having these hard-fail on missing based on current CLI impls doesn't seem right; should probably all use `.get()` (until they're properly segmented off in plugins)

Do we know what's still setting these? The `or`s in the plugin option setup code below are a little concerning... If we're keeping them around for backcompat with external callers, all the stuff that's flagged as "deprecated" here should be issuing dep warnings on use, otherwise we should just nuke it all now.

From what I know, there was some code out there directly interacting with PlayContext. And based on other deprecations, we've decided largely not to deprecate in the same release as the "replacement" was implemented.

see above- the `or`s here seem like they should go away along with the associated FieldAttributes, unless we add dep warnings above

if this is legit, we should probably have a test for it, if not, this seems like it could cause more problems than it solves...

Yeah, this seems like one of those unrelated changes, that shouldn't necessarily go here. I'll have to verify if it breaks become plugins by reverting this change for now.

Package        : ansible
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-10855 CVE-2018-10875 CVE-2018-16837 CVE-2018-16876
                 CVE-2019-3828

Several vulnerabilities have been found in Ansible, a configuration
management, deployment, and task execution system:

CVE-2018-10855 / CVE-2018-16876

    The no_log task flag wasn't honored, resulting in an information leak.

CVE-2018-10875

    ansible.cfg was read from the current working directory.

CVE-2018-16837

    The user module leaked parameters passed to ssh-keygen to the process
    environment.

CVE-2019-3828

    The fetch module was susceptible to path traversal.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.1.0-2+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ansible packages.

For the detailed security status of ansible please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ansible>

I'm looking at the code for the fork of Ansible 1.9 we use in SUSE OpenStack Cloud 8 CLM.  As Dirk mentioned, there is similar code that could also log the output, though there are many differences between the 1.9 and 2.4.6 versions.  Was there another reason for your statement that "older ones" are not affected that I might be missing? ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1118896#c8)  Joseph Davis   2019-01-03 05:21:50 UTC  ``` Note: one of the things refactored was the ssh.py location 1.9 ardana-ansible: connection_plugins/ssh.py 2.6.4 upstream ansible: lib/ansible/plugins/connection/ssh.py  Unfortunately, the refactoring is so different that in 1.9 there isn't a self._play_context.no_log variable to reference for the message logic. I'll have to dig a bit more to determine if there is a direct analog. Or if the change is needed in the old version - the problem only would arise if someone was running a playbook with the -vvv command and was capturing the logs in a place they would access them, and on a cloud system they would have to have direct login access to the system to accomplish that. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1118896#c9)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-04-03 07:11:04 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2019:1125-1: An update that solves 5 vulnerabilities and has two fixes is now available.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1112959#c0)  Karol Babioch   2018-10-23 15:56:10 UTC  ``` "User" module leaks any data which is passed on as a parameter to ssh-keygen. This could lean in undesirable situations such as passphrases credentials passed as a parameter for the ssh-keygen executable. Showing those credentials in clear text form for every user which have access just to the process list.

It looks like RH just patched versions 2.5, 2.6, and 2.7. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1112959#c3)  Joseph Davis   2018-11-09 18:25:16 UTC  ``` Also Ansible upstream only patched the 2.x versions. <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/47436> ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1112959#c4)  Fergal Mc Carthy   2018-11-09 18:50:14 UTC  ``` Looks like RH only patched the "active" ansible versions, e.g. current, and 2 previous versions...  Looking at the user module implementation in ansible 1.9.6 I see the following:          cmd.append('-N')         if self.ssh_passphrase is not None:             cmd.append(self.ssh_passphrase)         else:             cmd.append('')  That suggests we have the issue in ansible 1.9.6, and would need to backport the proposed fix to our ansible1 RPM that is used in the SOC/CLM product line. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1112959#c5)  Joseph Davis   2018-11-09 20:21:01 UTC  ``` Fergal and I checked our Ansible playbooks and find no uses of the 'ssh_key_passphrase' property (the ssh keys are managed a different way).  Thus for Cloud products the bug is already mitigated.  We can create a patch for the ansible1 project in IBS/OBS to backport the fix, but there isn't any urgency at this time. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1112959#c6)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-04-03 07:10:47 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2019:1125-1: An update that solves 5 vulnerabilities and has two fixes is now available.

This breaks the ansible zypper module completely.

I'm also wondering about:   "Could not chdir to home directory /home/william: No such file or directory" This looks to me like there is no directory for the user that logs in to the host - and therefor ansible could not create the temp directory and files that it needs to create. Can you please test other modules as well to see if this is really just a zypper module problem or a more generic one?  Thanks! ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1102126#c2)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-03-18 20:50:21 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1102126) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/686222> 15.0+42.3+Backports:SLE-12+Backports:SLE-15 / ansible ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1102126#c3)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-04-03 07:10:25 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2019:1125-1: An update that solves 5 vulnerabilities and has two fixes is now available.

Update to version 2.8.0
Major changes:
\* Experimental support for Ansible Collections and content namespacing -
Ansible content can now be packaged in a collection and addressed via
namespaces. This allows for easier sharing, distribution, and
installation
of bundled modules/roles/plugins, and consistent rules for accessing
specific content via namespaces.
\* Python interpreter discovery - The first time a Python module runs on
a target, Ansible will attempt to discover the proper default Python
interpreter to use for the target platform/version (instead of
immediately defaulting to /usr/bin/python). You can override this
behavior by setting ansible\_python\_interpreter or via config. (see
<https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/50163>)
\* become - The deprecated CLI arguments for --sudo, --sudo-user,
--ask-sudo-pass, -su, --su-user, and --ask-su-pass have been removed,
in favor of the more generic --become, --become-user,
--become-method, and
--ask-become-pass.
\* become - become functionality has been migrated to a plugin
architecture, to allow customization of become functionality and 3rd
party become methods (<https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/50991>)
- addresses CVE-2018-16859, CVE-2018-16876, CVE-2019-3828, CVE-2018-16837

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13.0 (Queens).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Low. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Ansible is a simple model-driven configuration management, multi-node deployment, and remote-task execution system. Ansible works over SSH and does not require any software or daemons to be installed on remote nodes. Extension modules can be written in any language and are transferred to managed machines automatically.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: ansible (2.6.11), openstack-ec2-api (6.0.1), openstack-manila (6.0.2), openstack-selinux (0.8.17), openstack-tempest (18.0.0), os-apply-config (8.3.1), python-barbicanclient (4.6.0), python-docker (2.4.2), python-heat-tests-tempest (0.1.1), python-novajoin (1.0.22), python-openstackclient (3.14.3), python-openstacksdk (0.11.3), python-vmware-nsxlib (12.0.4), rhosp-release (13.0.5). (BZ#1669146)

Security Fix(es):

* ansible: Information disclosure in vvv+ mode with no\_log on (CVE-2018-16876)

Update to version 2.8.0
Major changes:
\* Experimental support for Ansible Collections and content namespacing -
Ansible content can now be packaged in a collection and addressed via
namespaces. This allows for easier sharing, distribution, and
installation
of bundled modules/roles/plugins, and consistent rules for accessing
specific content via namespaces.
\* Python interpreter discovery - The first time a Python module runs on
a target, Ansible will attempt to discover the proper default Python
interpreter to use for the target platform/version (instead of
immediately defaulting to /usr/bin/python). You can override this
behavior by setting ansible\_python\_interpreter or via config. (see
<https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/50163>)
\* become - The deprecated CLI arguments for --sudo, --sudo-user,
--ask-sudo-pass, -su, --su-user, and --ask-su-pass have been removed,
in favor of the more generic --become, --become-user,
--become-method, and
--ask-become-pass.
\* become - become functionality has been migrated to a plugin
architecture, to allow customization of become functionality and 3rd
party become methods (<https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/50991>)
- addresses CVE-2018-16859, CVE-2018-16876, CVE-2019-3828, CVE-2018-16837
