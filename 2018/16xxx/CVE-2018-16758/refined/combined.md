*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

## Reporting security issues

In case you have found a security issue in tinc, please report
it via email to Guus Sliepen guus@tinc-vpn.org, preferrably PGP
encrypted. We will then try to get a CVE number assigned, and
coordinate a bugfix release with major Linux distributions.

## Security advisories

The following list contains advisories for security issues in
tinc in old versions:

* [CVE-2018-16758](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-16758):
  Michael Yonli discovered that tinc 1.0.34 and earlier allow a
  [man-in-the-middle
  attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) that, even if the MITM cannot decrypt the traffic sent
  between the two endpoints, when the MITM can correctly predict when
  an ephemeral key exchange message is sent in a TCP connection
  between two nodes, allows the MITM to force one node to send UDP
  packets in plaintext. The tinc 1.1pre versions are not affected by
  this.
* [CVE-2018-16738](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-16738):
  Michael Yonli discoverd that tinc versions 1.0.30 to 1.0.34 allow
  an [oracle
  attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_attack), similar to CVE-2018-16737, but due to the mitigations
  put in place for the Sweet32 attack in tinc 1.0.30, it now requires
  a [timing
  attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack) that has only a limited time to complete. Tinc 1.1pre16
  and earlier are also affected if there are nodes on the same VPN
  that still use the legacy protocol from tinc version 1.0.x.
* [CVE-2018-16737](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-16737):
  Michael Yonly discovered that tinc 1.0.29 and earlier allow an
  [oracle
  attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_attack) that could allow a remote attacker to establish one-way
  communication with a tinc node, allowing it to send fake control
  messages and inject packets into the VPN. The attack takes only a
  few seconds to complete. Tinc 1.1pre14 and earlier allow the same
  attack if they are configured to allow connections from nodes using
  the legacy 1.0.x protocol.
* [CVE-2013-1428](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1428),
  [DSA-2663](https://www.debian.org/security/2013/dsa-2663),
  [Sitsec advisory](http://sitsec.net/blog/2013/04/22/stack-based-buffer-overflow-in-the-vpn-software-tinc-for-authenticated-peers): stack based buffer overflow
* [CVE-2002-1755](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2002-1755):
  Tinc 1.0pre3 and 1.0pre4 VPN do not authenticate forwarded packets,
  which allows remote attackers to inject data into user sessions
  without detection, and possibly control the data contents via
  cut-and-paste attacks on CBC.
* [CVE-2001-1505](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2001-1505):
  Tinc 1.0pre3 and 1.0pre4 allow remote attackers to inject data into
  user sessions by sniffing and replaying packets.

## Possible weak keys generated by tinc on Debian (and derivates) due to a security bug in Debian’s OpenSSL packages

For those who run tinc on Debian or Debian-based distributions
like Ubuntu and Knoppix, be advised that the following security
issue affects tinc as well: <https://www.debian.org/security/2008/dsa-1571>
In short, if you generated public/private keypairs for tinc between
2006 and May 7th, 2008 on a machine running Debian or a derivative,
they may have been generated without a properly seeded random
number generator. Please ensure you have updated your OpenSSL
packages and regenerate all suspect keypairs. Do not forget to
restart tinc.

If you have compiled a static version of tinc on an affected
platform, you need to recompile tinc to ensure it is statically
linked with a fixed OpenSSL library.

I do not know if the session keys also have been weak, but it is
best to assume they were. If you exchanged private key material via
your tinc VPN, then an eavesdropper may have seen seen this as
well. Regenerate any keying material that you have exchanged via
your tinc VPN if any of the nodes was running on an affected
platform.

## Known security issues in tinc 1.0.x

Although tinc uses the OpenSSL library, it does not use the SSL
protocol to establish connections between daemons. The reasons for
this were:

* When tinc was created, SSL 3.0 was only just gaining popularity
  for use outside web browsers and servers.
* SSL at that time did not make it easy to have both sides of the
  connection authenticate each other.
* SSL requires a TCP-like transport layer to function, whereas a
  VPN works much more efficient if it can send encapsulated packets
  via a UDP-like transport layer.

When tinc 1.0 was released, the protocol used was declared
stable and would not change anymore. However, since then some
weaknesses were found, mainly by Peter Gutmann in 2003. René
Korthaus, Andreas Hübner, Felix Stein and Wladimir Paulsen have
also looked at tinc’s protocol recently, and have provided a more
in-depth analysis of the most critical weaknesses. In the interest
of full disclosure we will list the known weaknesses below.

Tinc 1.1pre3 and later will use a new protocol that fixes all
these issues, and that is similar to (D)TLS with a strong cipher
suite.

### Predictable IV

When encrypting UDP packets, tinc uses the CBC block cipher mode
with a 32-bit counter as the IV. This was chosen to avoid the
overhead of a full random IV for every packet. However, due to the
predictable IV, an attacker could launch a chosen-plaintext attack
(Katz/Lindell, “Introduction to cryptography”, p.97), allowing it
to distinguish known plaintexts from each other.

### Truncated MAC

By default, tinc uses a HMAC to authenticate packets that is
trunctated to 32 bits. This default was chosed to avoid the
overhead of a full 160 bit hash for every packet. An attacker on a
high-speed network connection could inject a forged packet by
sending it 231 times on average with different HMACs. It
is possible to change the strength of the HMAC with the
`MACLength` option. We will change the default length in
the future.

### Use of RSA

Tinc uses RSA without padding. Padding schemes are designed to
prevent attacks when the size of the plaintext is not equal to the
size of the RSA key. However, tinc always encrypts random numbers
that have the same size as the RSA key, which should safe.

There are timing attacks against RSA. Tinc does not protect
against those.

### Authentication protocol

Tinc uses RSA encryption to send symmetric cipher keys to its
peer. Then, a challenge/response exchange is done to verify that
each peer indeed has the private key. However, there is a
man-in-the-middle possible where an attacker that has the public
key of the peers can gain control over one side of the
communication between two peers. The MITM cannot decrypt messages
between peers, but it can send messages to the peer that initiated
the connection. If the MITM knows enough about the VPN, it could
trick peers into sending it packets that it can decrypt. However,
the MITM cannot send packets to other peers.

[StarWind’s response to Apache Log4j2 vulnerability CVE-2021-44228 (Log4shell)](https://www.starwindsoftware.com/security/apache_log4j/)

# Vulnerability Management Policy

StarWind follows a resilient and robust product security and vulnerability management policy.

StarWind puts a heavy emphasis on ensuring the security of our products and services since the release of our first product and throughout the entire company history. We always use extensive vulnerabilities testing programs, conduct periodical developer training, and implement secure design principles. As well, StarWind constantly works on improving extending its security development policies.

StarWind adheres to the following process to address vulnerabilities and inform our customers:

### **Constant** analysis

Our products and services are constantly and strictly analyzed for known vulnerabilities. This involves mandatory scans of all ready-to-release products and features inside the organization prior to the actual product release and delivery to the customers.

### Notification

StarWind makes sure to inform the customers in case the vulnerabilities are discovered. This is achieved by automatic notification of any vulnerability discovered to the customers who are subscribed for StarWind Security updates. This allows our customers to always stay informed and undertake the appropriate actions to ensure their business proper operation.

### Verification of the fixes

StarWind always first tests the fix to the identified vulnerability through a thorough QA cycle. Once the fix has been verified, we release a private security update and notify our customers about it as well as steps required to apply it. The StarWind security updates are delivered separately (for the subscribers or on-demand) and all of them are included as part of general StarWind build updates.

### Resolution

Once the resolution to the vulnerability is found, tested, and verified, we notify our customer about the resolution process and the steps required to resolve the vulnerability.

StarWind security and vulnerability information-delivery methods:

* Security Notice – informs customers about the security vulnerabilities that can affect StarWind products and require an upgrade or specific customer action to remediate.
* Security Bug Report – informs customers about low-level security vulnerabilities and can be resolved by a standard build upgrade procedure.

### **Security** updates **delivery**

StarWind as a company issues private security updates. Once notification about the potential vulnerability fix is received, a customer who is subscribed to the StarWind Security updates, receives notice on the remediation process steps. To receive a private security update, subscribe to StarWind Security updates or submit a request via StarWind support form – <https://www.starwindsoftware.com/support-form> with the description the vulnerability that is under the consideration.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Not to be confused with [Man-in-the-Mobile](/wiki/Man-in-the-Mobile "Man-in-the-Mobile") or [Meet-in-the-middle attack](/wiki/Meet-in-the-middle_attack "Meet-in-the-middle attack").
Form of message tampering

In [cryptography](/wiki/Cryptography "Cryptography") and [computer security](/wiki/Computer_security "Computer security"), a **man-in-the-middle**[[a]](#cite_note-9) (**MITM**) **attack**, or **on-path attack**, is a [cyberattack](/wiki/Cyberattack "Cyberattack") where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the [communications](/wiki/Data_communication "Data communication") between two parties who believe that they are directly communicating with each other, where in actuality the attacker has inserted themselves between the two user parties.[[9]](#cite_note-10)

One example of a MITM attack is active [eavesdropping](/wiki/Network_eavesdropping "Network eavesdropping"), in which the attacker makes independent connections with the victims and relays messages between them to make them believe they are talking directly to each other over a private connection, when in fact the entire conversation is controlled by the attacker.[[10]](#cite_note-11) In this scenario, the attacker must be able to intercept all relevant messages passing between the two victims and inject new ones. This is straightforward in many circumstances; for example, an attacker within range of a [Wi-Fi access point](/wiki/Wireless_access_point "Wireless access point") hosting a network without encryption could insert themselves as a man in the middle.[[11]](#cite_note-:0-12)[[12]](#cite_note-:1-13)[[13]](#cite_note-14)

As it aims to circumvent mutual authentication, a MITM attack can succeed only when the attacker impersonates each endpoint sufficiently well to satisfy their expectations. Most cryptographic protocols include some form of endpoint authentication specifically to prevent MITM attacks. For example, [TLS](/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security "Transport Layer Security") can authenticate one or both parties using a mutually trusted [certificate authority](/wiki/Certificate_authority "Certificate authority").[[14]](#cite_note-:2-15)[[12]](#cite_note-:1-13)

## Example

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Man-in-the-middle_attack&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Example")]
[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Man_in_the_middle_attack.svg/220px-Man_in_the_middle_attack.svg.png)](/wiki/File%3AMan_in_the_middle_attack.svg)

An illustration of the man-in-the-middle attack

Suppose [Alice](/wiki/Alice_and_Bob "Alice and Bob") wishes to communicate with [Bob](/wiki/Alice_and_Bob "Alice and Bob"). Meanwhile, [Mallory](/wiki/Alice_and_Bob#Mallory "Alice and Bob") wishes to intercept the conversation to eavesdrop (breaking confidentiality) with the option to deliver a false message to Bob under the guise of Alice (breaking non-repudiation). Mallory would perform a man-in-the-middle attack as described in the following sequence of events.

1. Alice sends a message to Bob, which is intercepted by Mallory:
   Alice *"Hi Bob, it's Alice. Give me your key."* →     Mallory     Bob
2. Mallory relays this message to Bob; Bob cannot tell it is not really from Alice:
   Alice     Mallory *"Hi Bob, it's Alice. Give me your key."* →     Bob
3. Bob responds with his encryption key:
   Alice     Mallory     ← *[Bob's key]* Bob
4. Mallory replaces Bob's key with her own, and relays this to Alice, claiming that it is Bob's key:
   Alice     ← *[Mallory's key]* Mallory     Bob
5. Alice encrypts a message with what she believes to be Bob's key, thinking that only Bob can read it:
   Alice *"Meet me at the bus stop!" [encrypted with Mallory's key]* →     Mallory     Bob
6. However, because it was actually encrypted with Mallory's key, Mallory can decrypt it, read it, modify it (if desired), re-encrypt with Bob's key, and forward it to Bob:
   Alice     Mallory *"Meet me at the park!" [encrypted with Bob's key]* →     Bob
7. Bob thinks that this message is a secure communication from Alice.

This example shows the need for Alice and Bob to have a means to ensure that they are truly each using each other's public keys, and not the public key of an attacker.[[15]](#cite_note-16) Otherwise, such attacks are generally possible, in principle, against any message sent using public-key technology.

## Types of MITM

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Man-in-the-middle_attack&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Types of MITM")]

There are several attack types that can fall into the category of MITM. The most notable are:

1. [HTTPS](/wiki/HTTPS "HTTPS") Spoofing: The attacker tricks the victim into believing their connection is secure by substituting a fake SSL/TLS certificate.
2. [SSL/TLS](/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security "Transport Layer Security") Stripping: Downgrades HTTPS traffic to HTTP, intercepting and reading unencrypted data.
3. [ARP](/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol "Address Resolution Protocol") [Spoofing](/wiki/ARP_spoofing "ARP spoofing"): Sends fake ARP messages to associate the attacker’s MAC address with a target IP, intercepting local network traffic.
4. [DNS](/wiki/Domain_Name_System "Domain Name System") [Spoofing](/wiki/DNS_spoofing "DNS spoofing")/Poisoning: Redirects DNS queries to malicious servers, leading victims to fake websites.
5. Session Hijacking: Steals session [cookies](/wiki/HTTP_cookie "HTTP cookie") or tokens to impersonate a legitimate user in an active session.
6. Man-in-the-Browser ([MITB](/wiki/Man-in-the-browser "Man-in-the-browser")): Malware alters browser activity, intercepting or manipulating transactions in real-time.
7. [Wi-Fi](/wiki/Wi-Fi "Wi-Fi") MITM ([Evil Twin Attack](/wiki/Evil_twin_%28wireless_networks%29 "Evil twin (wireless networks)")): Creates a fake Wi-Fi hotspot to intercept communications from connected devices.
8. [Email](/wiki/Email "Email") Hijacking: Intercepts email exchanges to manipulate or steal sensitive information.
9. [Replay Attacks](/wiki/Replay_attack "Replay attack"): Captures and retransmits valid data to repeat actions or disrupt communication.
10. Fake [Certificate Authority](/wiki/Certificate_authority "Certificate authority") (CA): Uses a fraudulent CA to sign fake certificates, tricking victims into trusting malicious connections.

## Defense and detection

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Man-in-the-middle_attack&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Defense and detection")]

MITM attacks can be prevented or detected by two means: authentication and tamper detection. Authentication provides some degree of certainty that a given message has come from a legitimate source. [Tamper detection](/wiki/Tamper-evident_technology#Computer_systems "Tamper-evident technology") merely shows evidence that a message may have been altered and has broken integrity.

### Authentication

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Man-in-the-middle_attack&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Authentication")]

All cryptographic systems that are secure against MITM attacks provide some method of authentication for messages. Most require an exchange of information (such as public keys) in addition to the message over a [secure channel](/wiki/Secure_channel "Secure channel"). Such protocols, often using [key-agreement protocols](/wiki/Key-agreement_protocol "Key-agreement protocol"), have been developed with different security requirements for the secure channel, though some have attempted to remove the requirement for any secure channel at all.[[16]](#cite_note-Merkle_1978-17)

A [public key infrastructure](/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure "Public key infrastructure"), such as [Transport Layer Security](/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security "Transport Layer Security"), may harden [Transmission Control Protocol](/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol "Transmission Control Protocol") against MITM attacks. In such structures, clients and servers exchange certificates which are issued and verified by a trusted third party called a [certificate authority](/wiki/Certificate_authority "Certificate authority") (CA). If the original key to authenticate this CA has not been itself the subject of a MITM attack, then the certificates issued by the CA may be used to authenticate the messages sent by the owner of that certificate. Use of [mutual authentication](/wiki/Mutual_authentication "Mutual authentication"), in which both the server and the client validate the other's communication, covers both ends of a MITM attack. If the server or client's identity is not verified or deemed as invalid, the session will end.[[17]](#cite_note-18) However, the default behavior of most connections is to only authenticate the server, which means mutual authentication is not always employed and MITM attacks can still occur.

Attestments, such as verbal communications of a shared value (as in [ZRTP](/wiki/ZRTP "ZRTP")), or recorded attestments such as audio/visual recordings of a public key hash[[18]](#cite_note-19) are used to ward off MITM attacks, as visual media is much more difficult and time-consuming to imitate than simple data packet communication. However, these methods require a human in the loop in order to successfully initiate the transaction.

[HTTP Public Key Pinning](/wiki/HTTP_Public_Key_Pinning "HTTP Public Key Pinning") (HPKP), sometimes called "certificate pinning", helps prevent a MITM attack in which the certificate authority itself is compromised, by having the server provide a list of "pinned" public key hashes during the first transaction. Subsequent transactions then require one or more of the keys in the list must be used by the server in order to authenticate that transaction.

[DNSSEC](/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions "Domain Name System Security Extensions") extends the DNS protocol to use signatures to authenticate DNS records, preventing simple MITM attacks from directing a client to a malicious [IP address](/wiki/IP_address "IP address").

### Tamper detection

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Man-in-the-middle_attack&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Tamper detection")]

Latency examination can potentially detect the attack in certain situations,[[19]](#cite_note-20) such as with long calculations that lead into tens of seconds like [hash functions](/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function "Cryptographic hash function"). To detect potential attacks, parties check for discrepancies in response times. For example: Say that two parties normally take a certain amount of time to perform a particular transaction. If one transaction, however, were to take an abnormal length of time to reach the other party, this could be indicative of a third party's presence interfering with the connection and inserting additional latency in the transaction.

[Quantum cryptography](/wiki/Quantum_cryptography "Quantum cryptography"), in theory, provides tamper-evidence for transactions through the [no-cloning theorem](/wiki/No-cloning_theorem "No-cloning theorem"). Protocols based on quantum cryptography typically authenticate part or all of their classical communication with an unconditionally secure authentication scheme. As an example [Wegman-Carter authentication](/w/index.php?title=Wegman-Carter_authentication&action=edit&redlink=1 "Wegman-Carter authentication (page does not exist)").[[20]](#cite_note-21)

### Forensic analysis

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Man-in-the-middle_attack&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Forensic analysis")]

[Captured network traffic](/wiki/Packet_capture "Packet capture") from what is suspected to be an attack can be analyzed in order to determine whether there was an attack and, if so, determine the source of the attack. Important evidence to analyze when performing [network forensics](/wiki/Network_forensics "Network forensics") on a suspected attack includes:[[21]](#cite_note-22)

* IP address of the server
* DNS name of the server
* [X.509](/wiki/X.509 "X.509") certificate of the server
  + Whether the certificate has been self signed
  + Whether the certificate has been signed by a trusted [certificate authority](/wiki/Certificate_authority "Certificate authority")
  + Whether the certificate has been [revoked](/wiki/Certificate_revocation "Certificate revocation")
  + Whether the certificate has been changed recently
  + Whether other clients, elsewhere on the Internet, received the same certificate

## Notable instances

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Man-in-the-middle_attack&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Notable instances")]

A [Stingray phone tracker](/wiki/Stingray_phone_tracker "Stingray phone tracker") is a [cellular phone](/wiki/Cellular_phone "Cellular phone") surveillance device that mimics a wireless carrier cell tower in order to force all nearby mobile phones and other cellular data devices to connect to it. The tracker relays all communications back and forth between cellular phones and cell towers.[[22]](#cite_note-wired-sting-23)

In 2011, a security breach of the Dutch certificate authority [DigiNotar](/wiki/DigiNotar "DigiNotar") resulted in the fraudulent issuing of [certificates](/wiki/Public_key_certificate "Public key certificate"). Subsequently, the fraudulent certificates were used to perform MITM attacks.[[23]](#cite_note-24)

In 2013, [Nokia](/wiki/Nokia "Nokia")'s [Xpress Browser](/wiki/Xpress_Browser "Xpress Browser") was revealed to be decrypting HTTPS traffic on Nokia's [proxy servers](/wiki/Proxy_server "Proxy server"), giving the company [clear text](/wiki/Clear_text "Clear text") access to its customers' encrypted browser traffic. Nokia responded by saying that the content was not stored permanently, and that the company had organizational and technical measures to prevent access to private information.[[24]](#cite_note-25)

In 2017, [Equifax](/wiki/Equifax#2017_withdrawal_of_vulnerable_mobile_apps "Equifax") withdrew its mobile phone apps following concern about MITM vulnerabilities.[[25]](#cite_note-26)

[Bluetooth](/wiki/Bluetooth "Bluetooth"), a wireless communication protocol, has also been susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks due to its wireless transmission of data.[[26]](#cite_note-27)

Package        : tinc
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-16738 CVE-2018-16758

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in tinc, a Virtual Private
Network (VPN) daemon. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2018-16738

    Michael Yonli discovered a flaw in the implementation of the
    authentication protocol that could allow a remote attacker to
    establish an authenticated, one-way connection with another node.

CVE-2018-16758

    Michael Yonli discovered that a man-in-the-middle that has
    intercepted a TCP connection might be able to disable encryption of
    UDP packets sent by a node.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.31-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your tinc packages.

For the detailed security status of tinc please refer to its security
tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/tinc>
