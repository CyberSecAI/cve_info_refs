# Baijiacms officials link

baijiacms: <https://github.com/baijiacms/baijiacmsV4>

# Why make this

BaijiacmsV4 does not open the issue,I can't feedback any issue,it's only possible to write up vulnerability here.

There is no filtering on parameter "order"，resulting in a vulnerability of blind sql injection,attackers can fetch data in databases easily，the vulnerability is so harmful.

PS:I submit the issue in this programer's another product which opens issue function
[baijiacms/baijiacmsV2-MultiManager#2](https://github.com/baijiacms/baijiacmsV2-MultiManager/issues/2)
