Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of filtering on the "order" parameter in BaijiacmsV4. This allows an attacker to inject SQL code directly into the query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Blind SQL Injection: Due to the lack of sanitization/validation of the "order" parameter, it is possible to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data exfiltration: An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database.
- The content notes that attackers can "fetch data in databases easily", highlighting the severity of the vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the "order" parameter in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication or special privileges are mentioned as a requirement to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Technical Details**
- The Proof of Concept (PoC) provided demonstrates the vulnerability with a crafted URL that includes a subquery with a `SLEEP(5)` function. This is a common technique for blind SQL injection detection, where the delay in response time indicates that the injection was successful.
- The PoC URL is `http://localhost/baijiacmsV4-master/index.php?act=index&beid=1&by=&cate=&do=goods&isdiscount=&ishot=&isnew=&isrecommand=&issendfree=&istime=&keywords=&m=eshop&merchid=&mod=mobile&op=get_list&order=(SELECT> * FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5))))`
