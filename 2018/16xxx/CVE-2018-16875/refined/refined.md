Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-16875:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `crypto/x509` package in Go versions prior to 1.10.6 and 1.11.3 does not limit the amount of work performed during X.509 certificate chain verification. This allows attackers to create malicious inputs that lead to excessive CPU consumption during verification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Resource Limitation:**  The core issue is the absence of proper constraints on the computational resources used during certificate chain verification.
- **CPU Denial of Service (DoS):** This lack of limitation leads to a potential for CPU DoS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **CPU Exhaustion:** Attackers can cause a denial-of-service condition by sending carefully crafted certificates that will exhaust the server's CPU resources.
- **Reduced Availability:** A successful attack results in reduced availability for services and applications using the vulnerable Go package, especially TLS servers using client certificates and TLS clients.
- **Key Recovery:**  The vulnerability may allow private key recovery attacks, especially on P-521 and P-384 elliptic curves.
- **Reduced Throughput:**  Even when the service doesn't completely crash, throughput will be reduced due to the added computational burden on the CPU.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is primarily network-based. A malicious client can initiate the attack by sending a crafted certificate during a TLS handshake.
- **Malicious X.509 Certificates:** An attacker crafts a specific X.509 certificate chain with a large number of intermediate certificates, requiring extensive work for verification by the vulnerable library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the targeted TLS server or client.
- **Ability to Send Malicious Certificates:**  Attackers need the ability to establish a TLS handshake with the vulnerable endpoint and supply a malicious certificate.
- **No Privileges Needed:** No special privileges or authentication are required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
-  The vulnerability affects programs written using the Go language that use the affected `crypto/x509` package.
-  SUSE and openSUSE have issued security updates and advisories to address this vulnerability.
-  The severity of the vulnerability is rated as "important" by SUSE.
-  SUSE also notes that this issue only affects go programs processing X.509 certificates.
-  The vulnerability specifically affects go get command in GOPATH mode when the `-u` flag is used.
-  The attack complexity is rated as high by SUSE and medium by NVD.
