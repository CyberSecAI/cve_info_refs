**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The root cause lies in **incorrect access checking** within the `overlayfs` mount functionality of the Linux kernel. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs in how `ovl_permission()` performs permission checks. It only checks permissions on the real inode and fails to check permission for overlay inode resulting in incorrect access control.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Incorrect Access Control:** The `ovl_permission()` function in `fs/overlayfs/inode.c` does not properly check permissions for both overlay and underlying inodes. It only checks the permissions for the underlying inode using the mounter's credentials and not the overlay inode using the calling task's credentials.
   - This allows a local user to bypass the intended permissions on the underlying file system when accessing it through an `overlayfs` mount.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **File Modification/Truncation:** A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to modify or truncate files within the underlying file system, even if they don't have the necessary permissions on the original files.
   - **Integrity Impact:** This has an impact on the integrity of the data in the underlying file system since it allows unintended write access to these files.
  
**5. Attack Vectors:**

    -   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local. A user with local access to the system is needed to create and mount an overlayfs to exploit the vulnerability.
   
**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
   - **Low privileges:** The attacker only requires low privileges.

**Technical Details & Descriptions:**

-   The vulnerability is related to the overlayfs, which is a filesystem that merges multiple filesystems into one mount point. The vulnerability stems from `ovl_permission()` function that is used to enforce permission in this filesystem.

-   The bug report on Bugzilla ([1106512](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1106512)) provides a clear example of how to exploit this issue:
    1.  A root user creates a file in the lower directory of an overlayfs mount.
    2.  A non-root user, after mounting the overlayfs, can truncate the root-owned file in a root-owned directory by simply touching a file with the same name through the overlayfs.
-   The fix involves modifying `ovl_permission` to perform checks on both overlay and real (underlying) inodes with appropriate credentials. The overlay inode is checked with calling task credentials and underlying inode with credentials of mounter.

-   The patch from [git.kernel.org](https://git.kernel.org) (commit `c0ca3d70e8d3cf81e2255a217f7ca402f5ed0862`) shows the code change:
    ```c
        int ovl_permission(struct inode *inode, int mask)
        {
          ...
           /*
            * Check overlay inode with the creds of task and underlying inode
            * with creds of mounter
            */
           err = generic_permission(inode, mask);
           if (err)
              return err;
           old_cred = ovl_override_creds(inode->i_sb);
           err = __inode_permission(realinode, mask);
           revert_creds(old_cred);
           return err;
        }
    ```
    This change ensures that permissions are validated using both the user's and the mounter's credentials to prevent the exploit.

-   The SUSE advisory page includes the following:
    -   CVSS v3 scores provided by both the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and SUSE. There is a minor difference in scores. NVD gives `5.5` and SUSE gives `5.3` for base score. The vectors also have minor differences.
    -   Affected SUSE products including SUSE CaaS Platform, SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop, SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension, SUSE Linux Enterprise Live Patching, SUSE Linux Enterprise Real Time, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, and SUSE Linux Enterprise Workstation Extension.
    -   Fixed package versions for different SUSE products.
-   The openSUSE list content provides similar patch information for openSUSE products using a kernel-debug/default/source version, where the fix is applied.

In summary, CVE-2018-16597 is a local privilege escalation vulnerability in the Linux kernel's `overlayfs` implementation caused by a missing permission check, leading to unintended file modification or truncation. The fix involves correct permission checks using both the user's and mounter's credentials while access files through the overlayfs.
