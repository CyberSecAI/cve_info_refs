  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-2018-16966": {
      "status": "relevant",
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The File Manager plugin for WordPress does not properly sanitize the 'public_path' parameter, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
           "CSRF"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of users who access the affected page. This could lead to session hijacking, information theft, or other malicious activities.",
        "attack_vector": "The attacker crafts a malicious HTML form that, when submitted by a logged-in administrator, modifies the 'public_path' setting of the File Manager plugin. This HTML form is served from a malicious site, exploiting the CSRF vulnerability by tricking the user into submitting the form while logged in. The XSS payload is delivered through the 'public_path' parameter.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to entice a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious website that contains the crafted HTML form. No special privileges are required; a standard WordPress administrator account is sufficient."
