Sometimes you don’t have ftp info and the client is not responding so you don’t have access to their hosting. Come to the rescue this plugin where I didn’t even have to reach out to the client.

This works great, and while I don’t need it on many sites I manage, if the client is on managed hosting, often it is the only tool that lets you work directly with the files, so it really comes in handy.

Sometimes you don’t have ftp info and the client is not responding so you don’t have access to their hosting. Come to the rescue this plugin where I didn’t even have to reach out to the client.
