# Global buffer overflow while parsing AQL (lvm\_set\_op, lvm\_set\_relation, lvm\_set\_operand)Â #596

## Description

[![@cve-reporting](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36542150?v=4&size=48)](/cve-reporting)[cve-reporting](https://github.com/cve-reporting)opened [on Jul 9, 2018](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/issues/596#issue-339486094)

Functions lvm\_set\_op, lvm\_set\_relation, lvm\_set\_operand try to memcpy input data (part of AQL files) into fixed size buffer lvm\_instance\_t->vmcode.

Allocated buffer can fit only DB\_VM\_BYTECODE\_SIZE (128) bytes and the check is missing.

Declaration:

db-options.h:110:

#define DB\_VM\_BYTECODE\_SIZE 128

aql-parser.c:108:

static unsigned char vmcode[DB\_VM\_BYTECODE\_SIZE];

This could potentially lead to Remote Code Execution, but attack is more difficult, because buffer is stored in global data segment and buffer is filled with bytecode, not directly by user provided data (Attack Complexity:High).

The risk of this issue is reduced (Attack Vector:Local) because attacker would need to run malicious AQL query, however it is quite possible when using database in IoT application.

Proposed CVSS score:

CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H (8.1 - high)

Following AQL code samples will trigger crash:

(crash\_003.sql):

REMOVE FROM aaa WHERE a - ( 000000000 / COUNT a - INLINE a - TYPE 000000000 / / a / < a - - a - TYPE 000000000 / TYPE 000000000 / / a / < a - MIN a - TYPE a - / a / < a - - a / / a / < a - - a - TYPE 000000000 - <- 000000000 / a / / 000000000 / / a / < a - - a aaa aaa 000000000 / - a SUM - ( FROM . ( a INTO ( aaa INTO , aaa STRING # aaa STRING (;

(crash\_004.sql):

SELECT aaa FROM a WHERE aaa <= a / COUNT a - - a - TYPE 000000000 \* / a / < a - - a - TYPE 000000000 / a / < a - - a - TYPE 000000000 / a / / a - TYPE 000000000 / RELATION a / < a - - a - TYPE 000000000 / / a / < a - - a - <- 000000000 / < a / COUNT a - - a - TYPE 000000000 \* / a / < a - - a - TYPE 000000000 / a / < a - - a - aaa INTO / a / / a - TYPE 000000000 / / a / < a - - a - TYPE 000000000 PROJECT / a / < a + - a - <- 000000000 / a / / 000000000 / a - - a - TYPE 000000000 / a / / 000000000 / a - - a - TYPE 000000000 / / a / < a \* a IN STRING a (

Mitigation :

The size of input string should be limited to DB\_VM\_BYTECODE\_SIZE.

Please take a look at patch fixing this issue in TizenRT (using antelope engine as arastorage):
