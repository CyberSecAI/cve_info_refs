- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a global buffer overflow during the parsing of AQL (Antelope Query Language) files. The functions `lvm_set_op`, `lvm_set_relation`, and `lvm_set_operand` attempt to copy input data into a fixed-size buffer (`lvm_instance_t->vmcode`) without proper size checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A global buffer overflow vulnerability is present due to the lack of input size validation before copying data into a fixed-size buffer. The buffer `vmcode` is defined with a size of `DB_VM_BYTECODE_SIZE` (128 bytes), and input data exceeding this size will cause a buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to remote code execution. However, the attack is considered more difficult because the buffer resides in the global data segment and is populated with bytecode rather than direct user-provided data. A crash is demonstrated.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker would need to execute a malicious AQL query. While this is categorized as local access, the described scenarios include potential IoT device applications which could be exposed to malicious queries in non-local circumstances.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to run or provide a crafted, malicious AQL query which is parsed by vulnerable functions. The complexity is rated as high since crafted bytecode rather than raw data is used in the overflow.
