The provided content is related to CVE-2018-16251.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw found in the wityCMS 0.6.2 version within the "Utilisateur" (User) menu. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input parameters in the `/admin/user/users` endpoint. Specifically, the `nickname`, `firstname`, and `lastname` parameters are vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: Unsanitized user inputs are directly used in SQL queries, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Database compromise: Attackers can use SQL injection to retrieve sensitive information from the database (e.g., usernames, passwords, other user data)
- Database manipulation: Attackers could modify or delete data within the database.
- Potential for further exploitation: Once the attacker has access to the database, they could use it to further compromise the server or application.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: Attackers inject malicious SQL code through the query parameters in the URL of the `/admin/user/users` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable `/admin/user/users` endpoint.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated, as this vulnerability can be exploited via the URL parameters.
- The attacker must have knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft the appropriate malicious queries.
