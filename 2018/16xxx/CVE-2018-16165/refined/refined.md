Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the LogonTracer application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts into the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts within a user's web browser when they interact with the vulnerable application. This could lead to:
    *   Stealing cookies or session tokens
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Modifying displayed content
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the web interface of the LogonTracer application.
*   The specific mechanism of injection is not detailed, but is likely through user-controlled input fields or parameters that are displayed without proper sanitization.
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script into the web interface. The attacker needs to entice a user to visit the affected application in their browser.
