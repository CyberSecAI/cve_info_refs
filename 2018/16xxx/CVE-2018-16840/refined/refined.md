  "CVE-2018-16840": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2018-16840",
      "Description": "A heap use-after-free flaw was found in curl versions from 7.59.0 through 7.61.1 in the code related to closing an easy handle. When closing and cleaning up an 'easy' handle in the `Curl_close()` function, the library code first frees a struct (without nulling the pointer) and might then subsequently erroneously write to a struct field within that already freed struct.",
        "Severity": "Critical"
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root Cause": "The vulnerability is a heap use-after-free in the `Curl_close()` function when closing an 'easy' handle.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Use-after-free"
      ],
        "Impact": "A remote attacker could use this issue to cause curl to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
      "Attack Vectors": [
        "Remote network attacks"
      ],
      "Attacker Capabilities": "A remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability by causing the curl library to close an easy handle in a specific way.",
        "Additional Information": "The vulnerability occurs because the `Curl_close()` function frees a struct without nulling the pointer, and then might attempt to write to a field in the freed struct, causing a use-after-free."
    }
  }
