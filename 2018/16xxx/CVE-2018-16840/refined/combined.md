## Description

A heap use-after-free flaw was found in curl versions from 7.59.0 through 7.61.1 in the code related to closing an easy handle. When closing and cleaning up an 'easy' handle in the `Curl_close()` function, the library code first frees a struct (without nulling the pointer) and might then subsequently erroneously write to a struct field within that already freed struct.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# USN-3805-1: curl vulnerabilities

31 October 2018

Several security issues were fixed in curl.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [curl](/security/cves?package=curl) - HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP client and client libraries

## Details

Harry Sintonen discovered that curl incorrectly handled SASL

authentication. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause curl to

crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-16839](/security/CVE-2018-16839))

Brian Carpenter discovered that curl incorrectly handled memory when

closing certain handles. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause

curl to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-16840](/security/CVE-2018-16840))

Brian Carpenter discovered that the curl command-line tool incorrectly

handled error messages. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to

obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-16842](/security/CVE-2018-16842))
