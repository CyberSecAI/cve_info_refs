  "CVE-2018-16802": {
    "description": "Incorrect \"restoration of privilege\" checking when running out of stack during exception handling could be used by attackers able to supply crafted PostScript to execute code using the \"pipe\" instruction. This is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2018-16509.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an incomplete fix for CVE-2018-16509. The fix involved catching errors and restoring a sane state in the error handler. However, the trusted code shares the operand stack with untrusted code. Thus, an attacker could fill the operand stack with junk, causing a stack overflow.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient error handling",
        "Shared operand stack between trusted and untrusted code",
        "Incomplete fix for a previous vulnerability",
        "Incorrect privilege restoration"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution by an attacker.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafted PostScript file",
        "Exploiting stack overflow during error handling"

      "attacker_capabilities": "Ability to supply a crafted PostScript file to be processed by Ghostscript."

    "affected_versions": [
      "Ghostscript before 9.25",
         "ghostscript versions shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 before RHSA-2018:3834"

        "Ghostscript version 9.25 and later",
        "ghostscript-9.07-31.el7_6.6 as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7"
    ],
      "additional_information": "The vulnerability is a result of incomplete fix for CVE-2018-16509.  The fix involves the use of 'trysetparams' which can itself cause an exception leading to an insecure state."
