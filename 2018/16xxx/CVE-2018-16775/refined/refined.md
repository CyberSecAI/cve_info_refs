- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The site name field in the "Categories" section of WistyCMS v0.62 does not properly sanitize user input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML, which will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected page. This could lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, and redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code via the site name field under the "Categories" menu when creating or editing a category.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have an authenticated session as an administrator to access the "Categories" management page.
