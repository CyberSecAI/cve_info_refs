## Installation

1. Deactivate or disable other sitemap generators.
2. Install the plugin like you always install plugins, either by uploading it via FTP or by using the “Add Plugin” function of WordPress.
3. Activate the plugin on the plugin administration page
4. If you want: Open the plugin configuration page, which is located under Settings -> XML-Sitemap and customize settings like priorities and change frequencies.
5. The plugin will automatically update your sitemap if you publish new content, so there is nothing more to do 🙂

## FAQ

### How do I generate a sitemap for my website?

To generate a sitemap for your website, follow these steps:

* Install and activate the XML Sitemap Generator for Google plugin on your WordPress site.
* Once activated, the plugin will automatically generate a sitemap.xml file for your website.
* You can access the sitemap by appending `/sitemap.xml` to your website’s URL (e.g., https://example.com/sitemap.xml).
* Submit your sitemap to search engines like Google, Bing, Yandex, and Baidu to ensure that your site is indexed and crawled properly.

### How do I submit my sitemap to search engines?

* Go to the Google Search Console and sign in with your Google account.
* Click on the “Sitemaps” tab and enter the URL of your sitemap.xml file (e.g., https://example.com/sitemap.xml).
* Click on “Submit” to submit your sitemap to Google.
* Repeat the process for other search engines like Bing, Yandex, and Baidu.

### How often should I update my sitemap?

It’s recommended that you update your sitemap whenever you make significant changes to your website’s content or structure. This will ensure that search engines are aware of any new pages or changes to existing pages on your site.

### What types of sitemaps does the plugin generate?

The XML Sitemap Generator for Google plugin can generate sitemaps in XML, HTML, RSS formats and in various types, including: Pages/Posts, Google News, Video, Image, Mobile, and more! Note: Some formats and types are only available to subscribers.

### Can I include images and videos in my sitemap?

Yes, you can include images and videos in your sitemap using the Google XML Sitemap Generator plugin. This will help search engines like Google and Bing to crawl and index your media files more efficiently.

### How does the plugin work with WooCommerce?

The XML Sitemap Generator for Google plugin is compatible with WooCommerce and can generate sitemaps for your online store’s product pages, categories, and tags. This will help search engines to index your products and improve your store’s visibility in search results.

### Can I customize the robots.txt file using this plugin?

Yes, you can customize the robots.txt file using the Google XML Sitemap Generator for Google plugin. This will allow you to control which pages and directories search engines can crawl and index on your site.

### Does this plugin support the Google Site Kit?

Yes, the XML Sitemap Generator for Google plugin is compatible with the Google Site Kit. This will allow you to track your site’s performance in Google Search Console and Google Analytics directly from your WordPress dashboard.

### Does this plugin support schema markup?

Yes, the XML Sitemap Generator for Google plugin supports schema markup, which can help improve your site’s visibility in search results by providing more information about your content to search engines.

### Where can I find the options page of the plugin?

It is under Settings > XML-Sitemap. I know nowadays many plugins add top-level menu items, but in most of the cases it is just not necessary. I’ve seen WP installations which looked like an Internet Explorer ten years ago with 20 toolbars installed. 😉

### Does this plugin use static files or “I can’t find the sitemap.xml file!”

Not anymore. Since version 4, these files are dynamically generated just like any other WordPress content.

### There are no comments yet (or I’ve disabled them) and all my postings have a priority of zero!

Please disable automatic priority calculation and define a static priority for posts.

### So many configuration options… Do I need to change them?

No, only if you want to. Default values are ok for most sites.

### My question isn’t answered here

Please post your question at the [WordPress support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/google-sitemap-generator/).

No less than 6 links per page going to the dev home pages on every sitemap, this leaches off a lot of your domain seo power. Do not install.

I tried dismissing the nag to join the beta program, and when it wouldn’t remove the nag, I tried to deactivate the plugin so I could delete it.
The plugin refused to deactivate, it would reactivate immediately upon deactivation.
I had to ssh into my server and physically delete the plugin.
Others seem to like this plugin, but I can’t recommend anything that forces you to go server-deep to remove it. There are other sitemap plugins out there. Use them.
