{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Incorrect buffer size in the multipart parser of the Rack (rubygem-rack) library.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A denial-of-service vulnerability arises because the multipart parser does not properly manage buffer sizes. A specially crafted request can force the parser into a pathological state, causing excessive CPU usage disproportionate to the request size.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful attack results in denial of service. The server's CPU resources can be exhausted, making it unresponsive or unavailable to legitimate users.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a malicious, carefully crafted HTTP request to an application that utilizes a vulnerable version of rubygem-rack.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable application. They don't need any prior access or specific credentials."
