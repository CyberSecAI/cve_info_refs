Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-16407 (based on the commit message mentioning "cross site scripting" and the GitLab issue mentioning "Persistent Cross Site Scripting" and the text content)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper HTML escaping of tag labels within the `App.tagSelectionTemplate` and `App.tagResultTemplate` JavaScript functions. The `tag.text` property, which contains user-provided tag labels, is directly inserted into the HTML structure of a `<span>` tag without any sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The application is vulnerable to persistent XSS because the injected malicious script is stored in the database as part of the tag label and executed every time the tag label is displayed in the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into tag labels. When a user interacts with the affected part of the application, this malicious script will execute within their browser session.
- This can lead to a wide range of attacks, including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing sensitive data (e.g., cookies, user credentials)
    - Defacing the application
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim
    - Other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User-provided input:** The attack vector is through user-controlled tag labels that are stored in the database, and the malicious script is embedded in the tag label.
- **JavaScript function:** The vulnerable javascript code is `App.tagSelectionTemplate` and `App.tagResultTemplate` where the user-provided input is inserted without proper escaping.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user with the ability to create or modify tags. This could be an authenticated user within the application. The attacker does not require any special privileges or specific network position other than an authorized user.
