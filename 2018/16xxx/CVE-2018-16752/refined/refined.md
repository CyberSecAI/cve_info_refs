{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of the `host` parameter in the ping functionality. Specifically, shell metacharacters are not properly escaped when constructing the ping command.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote Code Execution (RCE)",
      "Command Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the device's operating system with the privileges of the web server user.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the `/goform/sysTools` endpoint with a malicious command injected into the `host` parameter within the ping functionality.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to authenticate to the web interface of the device, although default credentials (admin:admin) may work. Once authenticated, they can trigger the vulnerable functionality by sending a crafted request."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The provided exploit script demonstrates how to send a command to the device and capture the output. The exploit requires the target URL, credentials, and the command to execute as command-line arguments. This exploit is specific to the `LW-N605R` router, firmware version `12.20.2.1486`."
