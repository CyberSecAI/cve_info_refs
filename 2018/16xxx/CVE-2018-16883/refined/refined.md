Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an improper restriction of access to the `infopipe` service in `sssd`. The `allowed_uids` configuration parameter, which is intended to limit access to specific users, was not being enforced correctly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leak:** The primary weakness is an information leak vulnerability. Due to the improper restriction, local attackers could potentially access sensitive information stored in the user directory via the `infopipe` service.
*   **Incorrect Parameter Enforcement:** The `allowed_uids` parameter was not being properly enforced, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A successful exploit could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information stored in the user directory. The severity is considered low because, by default, the information exposed is typically limited to the fields returned by `getpwent()` and `getgrent()`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local access. A local attacker who can interact with the `infopipe` service could potentially exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system where the vulnerable `sssd` service is running.
*   **Access to infopipe:** The attacker needs the ability to interact with the `infopipe` service. The `infopipe` service needs to be enabled (default in RHEL 7, disabled by default in RHEL 6), and reliance on `[ifp].allowed_uids` needs to be used for protection.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in `sssd` versions 1.13.0 to before 2.0.0.
*   The fix was introduced in `sssd` version 2.0.0 as part of a larger refactoring, not a direct patch.
*   The exposed information by default is limited to what is exposed by `getpwent()` and `getgrent()`.
