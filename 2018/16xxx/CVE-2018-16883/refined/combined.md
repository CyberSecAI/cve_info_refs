| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1659862#c0)  Doran Moppert    2018-12-17 04:24:55 UTC  ``` It was discovered that sssd versions prior to 2.0.0 did not properly restrict access to the infopipe according to the "allowed_uids" parameter.  If sensitive information were stored in the user directory, this could be inadvertently disclosed to local attackers.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1659862#c1)  Doran Moppert    2018-12-17 04:24:57 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Christian Heimes (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1659862#c3)  Doran Moppert    2018-12-17 05:39:38 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  This vulnerability is only exposed if the infopipe service is enabled (enabled by default in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, disabled by default in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6), and `[ifp].allowed_uids` is relied upon to protect sensitive information in the user directory.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1659862#c4)  Doran Moppert    2018-12-19 01:13:54 UTC  ``` This flaw was first present in sssd upstream release 1.13.0, and fixed in 2.0.0 as the result of re-factoring related code.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1659862#c5)  Doran Moppert    2018-12-19 01:23:15 UTC  ``` Created sssd tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1660688](show_bug.cgi?id=1660688 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2018-16883 sssd: Information leak in infopipe due to an improper uid restriction [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1659862#c7)  Markus Koschany    2018-12-20 14:47:52 UTC  ``` Could you tells us what specific commit fixed CVE-2018-16883?   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1659862#c8)  Jakub Hrozek    2018-12-20 19:26:24 UTC  ``` (In reply to Markus Koschany from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1659862#c7)) > Could you tells us what specific commit fixed CVE-2018-16883?  yes, but it's not going to be useful: fbe2476a3dd9be83ffa85c29dca26f734618d72d  As you can see, the CVE was fixed 'by accident' as part of a large refactoring. We'll provide fixes for this CVE for older branches in early January. Nonetheless, by default, the ifp interface only exposes the same attributes getpw* and getgr* expose, so I don't think the issue is really critical.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1659862#c9)  Markus Koschany    2018-12-20 19:49:07 UTC  ``` Thank you for the quick response.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1659862#c10)  Doran Moppert    2019-10-28 23:01:52 UTC  ``` Statement:  The information exposed by this vulnerability is typically not highly sensitive.  By default, it is only those fields returned by getpwent() and getgrent().   ``` |  |
