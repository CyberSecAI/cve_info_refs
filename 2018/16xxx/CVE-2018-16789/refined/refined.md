Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-16789:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `multipart/form-data` parser of the built-in web server in Shell In A Box. Specifically, it is triggered by malformed requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The `multipart/form-data` parser lacks proper error handling, leading to an infinite loop if the request payload is malformed.
- Failure to properly handle a missing final boundary in multipart form data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The infinite loop caused by a malformed request leads to 100% CPU utilization, rendering the server unresponsive. It stops serving new requests.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP request with a malformed `multipart/form-data` payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected Shell In A Box server. They do not need any special privileges to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a multipart/form-data request with a missing final boundary or when the payload is malformed.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.21, and a patch is available on GitHub.
- The exploit can be triggered by using curl with a specific header and a malformed data payload.
- The provided `curl` command demonstrates a simple way to trigger the DoS.
```
curl -v --header "Content-type: multipart/form-data;
boundary=------------------------8d14c0216fd84557" -d "impeachment"
<http://127.0.0.1:4200/s/>
