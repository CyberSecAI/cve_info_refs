Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-16808:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Dolibarr application, specifically within the "expense reports" module, fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when editing a billing at `/expensereport/card.php`. The application uses a blacklist approach with `eregi()` or `preg_match()` to validate parameters, which is insufficient to prevent XSS attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The application is vulnerable to stored XSS due to improper sanitization of the "comments" parameter and the public and private note fields in the expense reports module. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected data.
- **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The reliance on a blacklist using regular expressions (`eregi()` or `preg_match()`) to filter out potentially harmful characters is not robust and can be easily bypassed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can steal user sessions, including those of super administrators if they validate the billing containing the malicious script.
- **Unwilling Actions:** Attackers could force users to perform unwanted actions on the application.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive or private data could be exfiltrated to an external attacker-controlled destination.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Parameters:** The vulnerability is triggered by injecting malicious scripts into the "comments" parameter or public/private notes when editing an expense report via a POST request to `/expensereport/card.php?id=$id_integer&action=editline&rowid=$rowid_integer`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- No special privileges are needed to exploit the XSS.
- User interaction is required for the XSS payload to be triggered, as another user would need to view the expense report containing the malicious code.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Dolibarr versions 3.8.X up to 7.0.X.
- The provided exploit payloads involve escaping from the current `<td>` or `<textarea>` element by injecting an `<object>` element, and creating new `<td>` or `<textarea>` elements to maintain the structure.
- The payloads also make use of `data:text/html;base64` encoding to avoid simple filtering of XSS keywords.
- The suggested solution is to properly sanitize user input, specifically by using `htmlentities($parameter, ENT_QUOTE | ENT_HTML5, "UTF-8", true);`
