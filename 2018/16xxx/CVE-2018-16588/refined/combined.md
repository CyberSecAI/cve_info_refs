# CVE-2018-16588

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2018-16587.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2018-16597.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2018-16588 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-16588)

#### Description

Privilege escalation can occur in the SUSE useradd.c code in useradd, as distributed in the SUSE shadow package through 4.2.1-27.9.1 for SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 (SLE-12) and through 4.5-5.39 for SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 (SLE-15). Non-existing intermediate directories are created with mode 0777 during user creation. Given that they are world-writable, local attackers might use this for privilege escalation and other unspecified attacks. NOTE: this would affect non-SUSE users who took useradd.c code from a 2014-04-02 upstream pull request; however, no non-SUSE distribution is known to be affected.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1106914#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2018-09-03 11:28:20 UTC  ``` Looking into shadow's useradd code I stumbled across the fact that the logic added via useradd-mkdirs.patch leads to intermediate directories to be created with mode 0777. Example:  ``` root # useradd -d /home/some/where -m somebody  root # ls -ld /home/some drwxrwxrwx 3 root root 4096  3. Sep 13:24 /home/some ```  This means that world-writable directories come into existence. This is a security issue.  The devel and factory packages have this fixed for some time already I noticed. SLE-15/Leap-15 and SLE-12 are still affected, however. We need maintenance updates for this. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1106914#c1)  Michael Vetter   2018-09-04 09:05:47 UTC  ``` Thanks for discovering this.  I remember the last maintainer tried to upstream our useradd-mkdirs.patch (to have it behave like mkdir -p) in: <https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/pull/2> But it didn't get processed.  I adapted it later on when the patch didn't apply anymore due to some changes which enabled prefixes, and upstreamed it as <https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/pull/112> This was after the 4.6 (latest) release.  In this process we also changed from 0777 to 0755.  So upstream doesn't have this behaviour in any released version yet, only in git. And we only have the correct way in TW because there we got the problem when the patch didn't apply.  SLE-12_Update has 4.1.5 SLE-12-Sp2 has 4.2.1 SLE-15/Leap-15 has 4.5  I will create requests for those which change: -+				if (chmod (path, 0777) < 0) { ++				if (chmod (path, 0755) < 0) { ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1106914#c5)  Michael Vetter   2018-09-05 13:33:30 UTC  ``` SUSE_SLE-12_Update SR#171483 SUSE_SLE-12-SP2_Update SR#171485 SUSE_SLE-15_Update SR#171486  Got accepted. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1106914#c6)  Karol Babioch   2018-09-05 15:31:45 UTC  ``` Hi,  (In reply to Michael Vetter from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=1106914#c1)) > So upstream doesn't have this behaviour in any released version yet, only in > git.   I'm a little bit confused now after looking at the git history. Was this at any point in the official upstream git repository? Because commit b3b6d9d77, seems to be the patched version already.  The reason I'm asking is because it makes a difference in whether we can/should assign a CVE for this, and/or whether this should be done by MITRE. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1106914#c7)  Michael Vetter   2018-09-06 09:00:12 UTC  ``` > I'm a little bit confused now after looking at the git history. Was this at any point in the official upstream git repository? Because commit b3b6d9d77, seems to be the patched version already.  Upstream never had the 755 in it's code. It was part of the original patch proposed in <https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/pull/2> It was still in review for upstream, but already used by us.  Upstream maintainer already at this point, when reviewing the code, hinted to the 777 -> 755 change.  This PR then got forgotten it seems. And later when I updated our patch, which didn't build anymore due to the prefix change in the code, I also looked at the review of pull/2 and thought it makes sense. I created <https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/pull/112> which got merged as b3b6d9d77c1d18b98670b97157777bb74092cd69.  So like I tried to state above: This was only a problem for us. Upstream never had this 777 "issue" in its code :-) ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1106914#c8)  Karol Babioch   2018-09-06 13:30:10 UTC  ``` CVE-2018-16588 has been assigned to this. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1106914#c9)  Swamp Workflow Management   2018-09-24 16:09:28 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2018:2834-1: An update that contains security fixes can now be installed.
