The provided content is related to CVE-2018-16367.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The online judge's sandbox has an incorrect access control vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect access control allows users to write files to arbitrary locations.
- Specifically, users can write file directory listings to `/tmp`.
- The vulnerability allows users to leak file data through `#include` directives.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can write arbitrary files on the system.
- Attackers can leak file data, potentially including sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- Users can submit code that creates a directory listing and writes it to `/tmp`.
- The user can then include this `/tmp` file using `#include`, effectively reading its content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user able to submit code to the online judge system.
