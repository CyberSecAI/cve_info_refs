## Description

[![@plusls](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23459592?u=ec88a307e21f9743baeb791aa642f9042ab275dd&v=4&size=48)](/plusls)[plusls](https://github.com/plusls)opened [on Aug 9, 2018](https://github.com/QingdaoU/OnlineJudge/issues/165#issue-349147642)

The online Judge's sandbox have an incorrect access control vulnerability that can write file anywhere.

User can get the directory list and write it to /tmp. At last user can leak file data by #include

such as:

```
#include "/tmp/datafile"
```

There is my test submit:

[creat file](https://qduoj.com/status/4e2df90b1ec6707cc5da3bac91daa596)

[leak data](https://qduoj.com/status/853fb93178864da2e3a0339e6eb897ef)
