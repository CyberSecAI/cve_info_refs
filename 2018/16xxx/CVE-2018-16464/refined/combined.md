Your report should include:

#### Product version

A member of the security team will confirm the vulnerability, determine its impact, and develop a fix.

The fix will be applied to the master branch, tested, and packaged in the next security release.

Finally, your name will be added to the [hall of fame](https://hackerone.com/nextcloud/thanks) as a thank you from the entire Nextcloud community.

## PGP Key for Submissions

In order to facilitate secure submission of security issues,

we provide the following [PGP key](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xD75899B9A724937A) for confidential submission:
