  "CVE-2018-16859": {
    "Description": "Execution of Ansible playbooks on Windows platforms with PowerShell ScriptBlock logging and Module logging enabled can allow for 'become' passwords to appear in EventLogs in plaintext. A local user with administrator privileges on the machine can view these logs and discover the plaintext password. Ansible Engine 2.8 and older are believed to be vulnerable.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from how Ansible handles 'become' passwords on Windows systems when PowerShell ScriptBlock logging and Module logging are enabled. Instead of securely passing credentials, the password was included in the execution of PowerShell commands, which was then logged by the system in plaintext.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The primary weakness is the insecure handling of sensitive data (become passwords) within the Ansible framework when interacting with PowerShell on Windows. This results in the exposure of plaintext passwords in EventLogs. Specific vulnerabilities:\n\n-Insecure password handling: 'become' passwords are not passed securely to the 'ssh-keygen' executable and can be viewed in process lists.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation allows a local user with administrator privileges to view EventLogs and discover plaintext passwords. This can lead to a full compromise of the target system, or to other systems if the leaked password is reused.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access to a Windows machine where Ansible playbooks are being executed. The attack requires access to the machine itself.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs a local account with administrator privileges on a Windows machine where Ansible is executing playbooks. They also need the target system to have PowerShell ScriptBlock logging and Module logging enabled."
