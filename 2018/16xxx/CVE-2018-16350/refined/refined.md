- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `form[statcode]` parameter before storing and rendering it in the application's HTML output.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Specifically, a persistent/stored XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML, which will execute in the context of the victim's browser when they view the affected page. This can lead to various attacks, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites. In this case, it triggers when the administrator accesses the CMS home page.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker sends a crafted POST request to `/index.php?m=core&f=set&v=basic&_menuid=22&_su=wuzhicms` with the malicious payload within the `form[statcode]` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint and must be logged in with sufficient privileges to modify settings.
