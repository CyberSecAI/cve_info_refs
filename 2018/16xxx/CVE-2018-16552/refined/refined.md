{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Django-CRM application lacks CSRF token validation in almost all of its forms, including the user creation form.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can create their own account or potentially perform other actions on behalf of a logged-in user by sending a malicious link or embedding a form on a website they control.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious HTML form and tricks a logged-in user to submit it. The lack of CSRF protection allows the attacker to perform state-changing actions on behalf of the user, including creating new user accounts.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious web page that contains a crafted form pointing to the vulnerable Django-CRM application and induce a logged-in user to interact with the crafted form. The attacker doesn't need to know the session id as long as the victim is logged into the target application."
