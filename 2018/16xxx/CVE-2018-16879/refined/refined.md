{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The security channel for AMPQ connections in Ansible Tower was not properly configured. Specifically, the `BROKER_URL` setting was incorrectly set as `CHANNEL_BROKER_URL`, which does not establish a secure channel.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure default configuration of AMPQ channel",
       "Incorrect configuration setting used for securing the channel"
    ],
    "impact": "This could lead to data leaks of sensitive information like passwords. Additionally, it could enable denial of service attacks by allowing arbitrary messages to be sent to celery workers, potentially deleting projects or inventory files.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending arbitrary messages to celery workers via RabbitMQ, bypassing any security channel.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to send messages to the RabbitMQ broker used by Ansible Tower."
  },
  "additional_details": {
        "fixed_in_version": "ansible-tower 3.3.3",
        "affected_product": "Ansible Tower",
        "related_products": "Red Hat CloudForms versions 4.5 and 4.6 ship an ansible-tower which correctly sets the security channel by default. Red Hat CloudForms version 4.7 ships ansible-tower 3.3.3 which already contains the fix."
