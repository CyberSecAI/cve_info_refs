{
  "CVE-2018-16420": {
    "Description": "Multiple issues have been identified in OpenSC, ranging from stack based buffer overflows to out of bounds reads and writes on the heap. They can be triggered by malicious smartcards sending malformed responses to APDU commands.",
    "Root cause": "Improper bounds checking when handling responses from ePass 2003 smartcards in the `decrypt_response` function, which can lead to out-of-bounds writes.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer overflow in `decrypt_response` function within `src/libopensc/card-epass2003.c`"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (application crash) or potentially unspecified other impacts.",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafted smartcards sending malformed responses to APDU commands.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to supply crafted smart cards."
