- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A bug in the implementation of custom random number generators (`AES128CounterSecureRNG` and `AES256CounterSecureRNG`) within Akka Remoting, causing the generated numbers to repeat after a few bytes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Use of custom random number generators with flawed implementations.
    - The flawed implementations were not the default but recommended in documentation, increasing the probability of use by developers.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially compromise communication via Akka Remoting/Cluster, allowing for eavesdropping, message replay, or modification. Specifically, this could lead to unauthorized access to actor system data.
- **Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-middle attacks on the adjacent network where Akka remoting nodes are present.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be on the adjacent network.
    - The attacker does not require special access privileges but needs to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
    - The vulnerable random number generators must be enabled via configuration.
