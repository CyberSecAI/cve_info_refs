# introduction

Quoting from the WordPress Plugin site (<https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpforo/>)...

> wpForo Forums is the best WordPress forum plugin. Full-fledged yet easy and light forum solution for your WordPress website. Comes with modern and responsive forum layouts and styles. This WordPress forum plugin brings everything you need to run an efficient and professional community. Powerful and beautiful forum with unique features.

The forum plugin suffers from a privilege escalation vulnerability, whereby any registered forum user can escalate his privilege to become the forum administrator without any form of user interaction.

~~There is no details provided by the vendor during the release of 1.5.2, which fixes this vulnerability.

This approach is unsightly as it will prevent users from having the urgency to update their vulnerable version.

(<https://wpforo.com/community/wpforo-announcements/wpforo-1-5-2-is-released/>)~~

~~In future, any vulnerabilities discovered in this number one forum plugin will most likely, very probably, be disclosed and dropped as a 0-day~~

After voicing my opinion regarding the lack of information provided in the release, additional information has now been included in the release information!

(<https://wpforo.com/community/wpforo-announcements/wpforo-1-5-2-is-released/>)

This should provide more sense of urgency for users to update their vulnerable version

# affected programs & issues

Privilege Escalation in wpForo 1.5.1 and possibly all previous version

# discovery

author: sec.9emin1@gmail.com

discovered by: sec.9emin1@gmail.com

The vulnerabilities were discovered by reviewing the source code and verifying it with BurpSuite

# vulnerable-file.php

```
Technical details will be released here on 021218

```

# progress

020918 - issue raised and vendor replied

020918 - issue acknowledged and will be implementing a fix

060918 - Version 1.5.2 released - Issue is now resolved
