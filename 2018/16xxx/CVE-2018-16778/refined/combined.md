Jenzabar has built a partnership with its clients that is unique in the industry. Our associates have spent their careers working in higher education, providing them with unmatched insight into the long-term needs of our clients. We design our products to meet those needs, not to satisfy some fleeting trend in the marketplace. And we consult with our clients at every step of the design process, so we can match our vision to your vision. The result: products that are intuitive to use, affordable in cost, and powerful in action.

## Our Mission

## No matter the size of your enrollment or the scope of your programs, we can help you fulfill your mission. We have products designed for every institution.

Four-Year Private

As private colleges and universities do not receive funds from state legislatures, you rely heavily on tuition and private contributions. Jenzabar helps you build strong relationships with your constituents. Not only is this good for students–it’s critical for your financial stability.

Four-Year Public

State-supported colleges and universities are often targets for cost cutting. Your institution is undoubtedly trying to do more with less. With Jenzabar, you’ll always get a high return on your technology investment.

Two-Year Institutions

It’s a difficult time as most two-year institutions are grappling with fluctuating enrollment and diminishing state support. Jenzabar equips you to respond to these challenges with a greater focus on student success and institutional accountability.

Continuing Education

Continuing education departments must meet the unique challenges of workforce development, certificate, adult learning, and other non-traditional programs. Jenzabar offers administrative software solutions that meet the needs of institutions offering non-traditional programs.

Consortia

Consortia provide a forum for members to share ideas, concerns, and resources. Jenzabar partners with consortia to enhance the academic experience for students and faculty as well as to improve operational efficiencies through shared resources.

Specialized Schools

Whether your specialized college is focused on providing specific degree and/or certificate programs, Jenzabar will work with you to deliver on your mission.

Online Institutions

From promoting student success without the benefit of in-person interactions to providing the caliber of services required by accrediting organizations, online institutions face unique challenges. Jenzabar has the solutions to help you achieve your goals.
