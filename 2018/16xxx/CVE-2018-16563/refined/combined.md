SUMMARY

The EN100 Ethernet communication module and SIPROTEC 5 relays are affected by a security vulnera-
bility which could allow an attacker to conduct a Denial-of-Service attack over the network. Siemens has
released updates for some affected products, is working on updates for the remaining affected products,
and recommends speciﬁc countermeasures until ﬁxes are available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Block access to port 102/tcp e.g. with an external ﬁrewall.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling
and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated
means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly
recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff
of the update process in the target environment.

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate
mechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to
our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The EN100 Ethernet modules are used for enabling process communication on either IEC 61850,
PROFINET IO, Modbus TCP, DNP3 TCP or IEC 104 protocols via electrical/optical 100 Mbit interfaces on
SIPROTEC 4, SIPROTEC Compact and Reyrolle devices.

SIPROTEC 5 devices provide a wide range of integrated protection, control, measurement, and automa-
tion functions for electrical substations and other ﬁelds of application.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-16563

Specially crafted packets to port 102/tcp could cause a denial-of-service condition in the affected
products. A manual restart is required to recover the EN100 module functionality of the affected
devices.

Successful exploitation requires an attacker with network access to send multiple packets to the
affected products or modules. As a precondition the IEC 61850-MMS communication needs to be
activated on the affected products or modules. No user interaction or privileges are required to exploit
the vulnerability. The vulnerability could allow causing a Denial-of-Service condition of the network
functionality of the device, compromising the availability of the system.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.
