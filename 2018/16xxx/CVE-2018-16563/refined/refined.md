- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Specially crafted packets sent to port 102/tcp can cause a denial-of-service condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A vulnerability exists in the handling of network packets on port 102/tcp. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted packets, leading to a denial-of-service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition in the affected products. This requires a manual restart to recover the EN100 module's functionality. The network functionality of the device is compromised, leading to availability issues.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, requiring the attacker to send malicious packets to port 102/tcp of the affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to send multiple specially crafted packets to the affected products or modules. IEC 61850-MMS communication needs to be activated on the affected products or modules. No user interaction or privileges are needed.
