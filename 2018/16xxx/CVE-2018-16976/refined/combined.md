# CVE-2018-16976

| **Name** | CVE-2018-16976 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | Gitolite before 3.6.9 does not (in certain configurations involving @all or a regex) properly restrict access to a Git repository that is in the process of being migrated until the full set of migration steps has been completed. This can allow valid users to obtain unintended access. |

Björn Kautler pointed out that, when a repo is being migrated into
gitolite as per the documentation [1], there is a gap between the actual
move of the repo and the rest of the process where a user can gain read
or write access to the repo, which he would *not* have had after the
completion of the process.

My first thought was to document this, and advise people to use the
'writable' command to disable writes, but there is nothing as simple and
painless to prevent reads.  (On the plus side, this kind of racy read
access can only happen if the conf is using the "deny-rules" option to
restrict reads; without that, it makes no difference -- i.e., he gets no
access that he would not have got later anyway).

But eventually I realised that documentation was frustrating, for
various reasons, and that at least in this case there is a way to fix it
in the code -- just block all access to a repo that is in
~/repositories, but which does not yet have the update hook setup
correctly.  Plus, the code does not impact anything else, and is
basically just an extra check.
