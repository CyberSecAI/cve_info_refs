Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by a directory traversal flaw in the Rubedo CMS application.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when accessing files, allowing attackers to use directory traversal sequences (`../`) to navigate to arbitrary locations within the file system.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's file system, potentially gaining access to sensitive information such as configuration files, application code, or user data.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted URL containing directory traversal sequences. Specifically, the exploit uses the `/theme/default/img/` path combined with multiple `../` sequences to traverse up the directory tree.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No prior authentication or special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
The provided Proof-of-Concept (PoC) demonstrates reading the `/etc/passwd` file:

```
/theme/default/img/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e//etc/passwd
```
This URL uses multiple URL-encoded `../` sequences (`%2e%2e/`) to navigate out of the expected directory and into the root directory, allowing access to the `/etc/passwd` file.
