  "CVE-2018-16477": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The provided content describes a bypass vulnerability in Active Storage, specifically affecting versions 5.2.0 and greater. The vulnerability allows an attacker to modify the `content-disposition` and `content-type` parameters in signed download URLs generated by Active Storage, which could lead to malicious HTML files being served and executed inline.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way Active Storage generates signed download URLs for Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and Disk services. These URLs include `content-disposition` and `content-type` parameters that can be manipulated by an attacker.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure generation of signed URLs",
        "Lack of sanitization of `content-disposition` and `content-type` parameters"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could upload a specially crafted HTML file, and by modifying the `content-disposition` and `content-type` parameters in the signed download URL, cause the file to be executed inline in the user's browser. This can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the vulnerable application.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Modifying URL parameters",
        "Serving malicious HTML files"
       ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to modify URL parameters when creating and using signed URLs. The attacker may also need to use techniques like cookie bombing or specially crafted AppCache manifests to gain access to private signed URLs."
    },
    "remediation": "The vulnerability is fixed in version 5.2.1.1. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or use the provided monkey patches in an initializer to mitigate the issue. For GCS users, it is also recommended to update existing blobs with the following code snippet: `ActiveStorage::Blob.find_each do |blob| blob.send :update_service_metadata end`."
