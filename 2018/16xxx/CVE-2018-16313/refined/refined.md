The provided content discusses XSS vulnerabilities in Bludit CMS.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the article content section and the user add module. Specifically, the CMS fails to filter JavaScript code and other potentially harmful input within these areas.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS: Malicious scripts injected through the article content or user name fields are stored in the database and executed when other users view the content or the user list, impacting other users of the CMS.
- Lack of input validation/sanitization: The CMS does not filter the user-provided input for potentially malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- This can lead to a range of attacks, including:
    - Account hijacking (session stealing).
    - Defacement of the website.
    - Phishing attacks.
    - Data theft.

**Attack vectors:**
- Article content creation: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into an article they create.
- User registration: An attacker can inject malicious code into the username field during user registration via the "add user" module.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account with privileges to create or edit articles (for the article content XSS) or create new user accounts.
- Access to the CMS admin panel is necessary for exploitation.
