![](code.png)

In function do\_avatar , the program doesn’t verify the post parameter ‘imgurl’ , so we can deliver a file path to imgurl . Then we post the data twice to trigger sp\_delete\_avatar function which can delete any file .
In line 176 , the program delete any ‘/’ , but in windows we can use ‘\’ to bypass it.

POC:

| ``` 12 ``` | ``` http://localhost/ThinkCMFX/index.php?g=user&m=profile&a=do_avatarPOST:imgurl=..\..\..\data\install.lock ``` |

First register a member test
