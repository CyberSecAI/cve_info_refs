OpenAFS Security Advisory-2018-002
Issued: 11 September, 2018
Topic: information leakage from uninitialized RPC output variables
CVE-2018-16948
Affected: OpenAFS client versions 1.0 through 1.6.22.4 and 1.8.0 through 1.8.1.1
OpenAFS server versions 1.0 through 1.6.22.4 and 1.8.0 through 1.8.1.1
Several RPC server routines did not fully initialize their output variables
before returning, leaking memory contents from both the stack and the heap.
Because the OpenAFS cache manager functions as an Rx server for the AFSCB service,
clients are also susceptible to information leakage.
SUMMARY
=======
OpenAFS uses the Rx RPC protocol for all remote operations, and uses the
rxgen utility to generate the server RPC stubs. Output variables are
allocated either on the stack (for scalars) or on the heap, by the RPC
handler (for variable-length arrays). Many RPC handlers did not fully
initialize these output variables, leaking memory contents to the remote
caller for otherwise-successful RPCs.
IMPACT
======
Many of the affected RPCs do not require authentication (and are simple
"data lookup" functions), so an unauthenticated attacker could obtain
tens to hundreds of bytes of memory contents from the affected process,
per RPC call. Over time, this may be sufficient to build up a picture
of interesting data, such as file or datbase contents, but the amount and
rate of data exposure is highly context dependent.
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
All releases of OpenAFS prior to 1.6.23 are affected, as are OpenAFS
1.8.0, 1.8.1, and 1.8.1.1.
FIXES
=====
The OpenAFS project recommends that administrators upgrade all clients
and servers to the 1.8.2 or 1.6.23 releases. It is necessary to restart
affected processes in order for the fixes to take effect.
DETAILS
=======
Only successful RPCs will trigger the information leakage; unsuccessful
RPCs are replied to with Rx abort packets that do not include the output
variable contents. For RPCs that require authentication, this limits
the scope of information disclosure, but many of the following RPCs
do not require any form of authentication and will leak information even
to anonymous callers.
STC\_ReadLabel does not initialize the 32-bit taskId output parameter.
VOTE\_Debug and VOTE\_XDebug (udebug) both leave a single field
uninitialized if there is no current transaction. This leaks the memory
contents of the ubik server over the wire:
struct ubik\_debug
- 4 bytes in member writeTrans
KAM\_ListEntry (kas list) does not initialize its output correctly. It
leaks kaserver memory contents over the wire:
struct kaindex
- up to 64 bytes for member name
- up to 64 bytes for member instance
TC\_ScanStatus (backup status) and TC\_GetStatus (internal backup status
watcher) do not initialize their output buffers. They leak memory
contents over the wire:
struct tciStatusS
- up to 64 bytes in member taskName (TC\_MAXNAMELEN 64)
- up to 64 bytes in member volumeName (TC\_MAXNAMELEN 64)
TC\_ReadLabel (backup readlabel) does not initialize its output buffer
completely. It leaks butc memory contents over the wire:
struct tc\_tapeLabel
- up to 32 bytes from member afsname (TC\_MAXTAPELEN 32)
- up to 32 bytes from member pname (TC\_MAXTAPELEN 32)
The following budb RPCs do not initialize their output correctly.
This leaks buserver memory contents over the wire:
BUDB\_FindLatestDump (backup dump)
BUDB\_FindDump (backup volrestore, diskrestore, volsetrestore)
BUDB\_GetDumps (backup dumpinfo)
BUDB\_FindLastTape (backup dump)
struct budb\_dumpEntry
- up to 32 bytes in member volumeSetName
- up to 256 bytes in member dumpPath
- up to 32 bytes in member name
- up to 32 bytes in member tape.tapeServer
- up to 32 bytes in member tape.format
- up to 256 bytes in member dumper.name
- up to 128 bytes in member dumper.instance
- up to 256 bytes in member dumper.cell
RXAFSCB\_TellMeAboutYourself does not completely initialize its output
buffers. This leaks kernel memory over the wire:
struct interfaceAddr
Unix cache manager (libafs)
- up to 124 bytes in array addr\_in ((AFS\_MAX\_INTERFACE\_ADDR 32 \* 4) - 4))
- up to 124 bytes in array subnetmask (the same)
- up to 124 bytes in array mtu (the same)
Windows cache manager
- 64 bytes in array addr\_in ((AFS\_MAX\_INTERFACE\_ADDR 32-CM\_MAXINTERFACE\_ADDR 16)\* 4)
- 64 bytes in array subnetmask (the same)
- 64 bytes in array mtu (the same)
RXAFSCB\_GetLock (cmdebug) does not correctly initialize its output.
This leaks kernel memory over the wire:
struct AFSDBLock
- up to 14 bytes for member name (16 - '\0')
PR\_ListEntries (pts listentries) does not properly initialize its output
buffers. This leaks ptserver memory over the wire:
struct prlistentries
- up to 62 bytes for each entry name (PR\_MAXNAMELEN 64 - 'a\0')
AFSVolMonitor (vos status) does not properly initialize its output
buffers. This leaks information from volserver memory:
struct transDebugInfo
- up to 29 bytes in member lastProcName (30-'\0')
- 16 bytes in members readNext, tranmitNext, lastSendTime,
lastReceiveTime
AFSVolPartitionInfo and AFSVolPartitionInfo64 (vos partinfo) do not
properly initialize their reply buffers. This leaks the contents of
volserver memory over the wire:
AFSVolPartitionInfo (struct diskPartition)
- up to 24 bytes in member name (32-'/vicepa\0'))
- up to 12 bytes in member devName (32-'/vicepa/Lock/vicepa\0'))
AFSVolPartitionInfo64 (struct diskPartition64)
- up to 248 bytes in member name (256-'/vicepa\0'))
- up to 236 bytes in member devName (256-'/vicepa/Lock/vicepa\0')
PR\_IDToName does not completely initialize the return array of names,
and thus leaks information from ptserver memory:
- up to 62 bytes per requested id (PR\_MAXNAMELEN 64 - 'a\0')

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

OpenAFS Security Advisory-2018-003
Issued: 11 September, 2018
Topic: Denial of service due to excess resource consumption
CVE-2018-16949
Affected: OpenAFS server versions 1.0 through 1.6.22.4 and 1.8.0 through 1.8.1.1
Several data types used as RPC input variables were implemented as unbounded
array types, limited only by the inherent 32-bit length field to 4GB.
An unauthenticated attacker could send, or claim to send, large input
values and consume server resources waiting for those inputs, denying service
to other valid connections.
SUMMARY
=======
OpenAFS uses the Rx RPC protocol for all remote operations; RPC inputs
and outputs are described using the XDR data description language. XDR
includes a facility for variable-length (up to 4GB) arrays, optionally
subject to a smaller bound on their size. For several RPCs, OpenAFS
servers would accept and attempt to unmarshall into memory input arrays
up to the full 4GB limit; length and authentication checks in RPC handler
functions would be applied only after low-level memory allocation and
unmarshalling. This allows unauthenticated attackers to consume large
amounts of server memory and network bandwidth, producing service degradation
or denial of service to legitimate clients.
IMPACT
======
In general, an unauthenticated attacker can cause the affected server process
to allocate up to the maximum malloc size, or 4GB, whichever is smaller, per
RPC. Some systems will use memory overcommit and not actually allocate the
full storage request at malloc time, in which case the attacker can send
junk data contents but trickle off the flow of data towards the end, effectively
causing the full allocation to be made and stalled. By forcing such allocations
but keeping the connection open, the attacker can consume large amounts of
memory on the server and cause a denial of service condition. There is no
particular amplifcation on the network bandwidth consumption other than that
caused by keeping multiple connections open for bulk data transfer, but since
the bandwidth consumption is prior to any authentication checks or rate limiting
of failed RPCs, it may still present an impact in some operational environments.
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
All releases of OpenAFS prior to 1.6.23 are affected, as are OpenAFS
1.8.0, 1.8.1, and 1.8.1.1.
FIXES
=====
The OpenAFS project recommends that administrators upgrade all servers
to the 1.8.2 or 1.6.23 releases. It is necessary to restart
affected processes in order for the fixes to take effect.
DETAILS
=======
The Rx RPCs used by OpenAFS include marshalling the XDR input types on
the client into a stream of data over the network; the corresponding
RPC server is responsible for unmarshalling the stream of bytes from the
network into the corresponding data types/structures on the server. This
unmarshalling occurs at a very low level and must happen before any
application-level RPC handler code is run, since the RPC handler expects
to be called with the assembled C data types as arguments. Authentication
and certain sanity checking of input values is performed in the RPC handler
layer, after data has been unmarshalled into memory. An attacker can use
an Rx connection with the "null" security class (so no Rx-layer authentication
requirement) to cause the unmarshalling to occur in an unauthenticated
context, since enforcement of "authentication required" RPCs occurs in the
application-layer RPC handler. As such, the limits in the XDR data description
for the RPC inputs are the only limit on how much resources the low-level
decoder will consume in processing the RPC. When an XDR unbounded array type
is used, the resulting resource consumption can be quite large, even if the
call is doomed to fail once control passes into the application's RPC handler.
The attacker can continue responding to Rx keepalives while failing to send
the final amount of data, in order to keep control flow in the low-level
unmarshalling code for minutes while still consuming the large amount of memory.
Even for data types for which there is no abstract limit on the amount of
input data, implementations should place an arbitrary implementation-specific
limit (that could be raised later as necessary) on input arrays, in order to
limit the scope of this denial of service attack.
The affected RPCs are as follows:
AFSVolCreateVolume, AFSVolClone, AFSVolSignalRestore, and AFSVolSetIdsTypes
accepted input volume names as unbounded string arrays, and
AFSVolPartitionInfo and AFSVolPartitionInfo64 accepted partition names
as unbounded string arrays.
AFSVolForwardMultiple accepted an unbounded array of (replica) destinations,
even though OpenAFS does not support more than 13 replicas in its database
per volume.
BUDB\_SaveText accepted an unbounded character list array as input, even though
all in-tree consumers are limited to about 2KB at most.
VL\_RegisterAddrs accepted an unbounded array of fileserver addresses.

Package        : openafs
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-16947 CVE-2018-16948 CVE-2018-16949
Debian Bug     : 908616

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in openafs, an implementation of
the distributed filesystem AFS. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2018-16947

    Jeffrey Altman reported that the backup tape controller (butc)
    process does accept incoming RPCs but does not require (or allow
    for) authentication of those RPCs, allowing an unauthenticated
    attacker to perform volume operations with administrator
    credentials.

    <https://openafs.org/pages/security/OPENAFS-SA-2018-001.txt>

CVE-2018-16948

    Mark Vitale reported that several RPC server routines do not fully
    initialize output variables, leaking memory contents (from both
    the stack and the heap) to the remote caller for
    otherwise-successful RPCs.

    <https://openafs.org/pages/security/OPENAFS-SA-2018-002.txt>

CVE-2018-16949

    Mark Vitale reported that an unauthenticated attacker can consume
    large amounts of server memory and network bandwidth via
    specially crafted requests, resulting in denial of service to
    legitimate clients.

    <https://openafs.org/pages/security/OPENAFS-SA-2018-003.txt>

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.20-2+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your openafs packages.

Package        : openafs
Version        : 1.6.9-2+deb8u8
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-16947 CVE-2018-16948 CVE-2018-16949
Debian Bug     : 908616

Several security vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenAFS, a
distributed file system.

CVE-2018-16947

    The backup tape controller process accepts incoming RPCs but does
    not require (or allow for) authentication of those RPCs. Handling
    those RPCs results in operations being performed with administrator
    credentials, including dumping/restoring volume contents and
    manipulating the backup database.

CVE-2018-16948

    Several RPC server routines did not fully initialize their output
    variables before returning, leaking memory contents from both the
    stack and the heap. Because the OpenAFS cache manager functions as
    an Rx server for the AFSCB service, clients are also susceptible to
    information leakage.

CVE-2018-16949

    Several data types used as RPC input variables were implemented as
    unbounded array types, limited only by the inherent 32-bit length
    field to 4GB. An unauthenticated attacker could send, or claim to
    send, large input values and consume server resources waiting for
    those inputs, denying service to other valid connections.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1.6.9-2+deb8u8.

We recommend that you upgrade your openafs packages.
