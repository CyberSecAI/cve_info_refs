## Description

[![@cve-reporting](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36542150?v=4&size=48)](/cve-reporting)[cve-reporting](https://github.com/cve-reporting)opened [on Jul 9, 2018](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/issues/597#issue-339490123)

Functions lvm\_register\_variable(), lvm\_set\_variable\_value(), create\_intersection(), create\_union() write data into global fixed size buffers named variables and derivations making off-by-one error.

Additionally functions lookup(), print\_operand(), print\_derivations() (only in DEBUG mode), lvm\_get\_derived\_range() read the data from buffers variables and derivations making similar off-by-one error.

Buffers are declared as:

lvm.c:85: static variable\_t variables[LVM\_MAX\_VARIABLE\_ID - 1];

lvm.c:88: static derivation\_t derivations[LVM\_MAX\_VARIABLE\_ID - 1];

Sample usage:

lvm.c:110:

for(var = variables; var <= &variables[LVM\_MAX\_VARIABLE\_ID - 1] && var->name[0] != '\0'; var++) {

Following AQL code samples will trigger crash:

SELECT x1 FROM x2 WHERE x3 - x4 - x5 + x6

This could potentially lead to Remote Code Execution, but attack is more difficult, because buffer is stored in global data segment (Attack Complexity:High).

The risk of this issue is reduced (Attack Vector:Local) because attacker would need to run malicious AQL query, however it is quite possible when using database in IoT application.

Proposed CVSS score:

CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H (8.1 - high)
