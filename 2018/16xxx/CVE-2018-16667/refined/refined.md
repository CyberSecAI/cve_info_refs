- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Off-by-one error when writing and reading data to/from global fixed size buffers named `variables` and `derivations` in the `lvm.c` file. Specifically, the loop conditions and array indexing within functions `lvm_register_variable()`, `lvm_set_variable_value()`, `create_intersection()`, `create_union()`, `lookup()`, `print_operand()`, `print_derivations()`, and `lvm_get_derived_range()` can lead to out-of-bounds access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Global buffer overflow, off-by-one error
- **Impact of exploitation**: Potentially leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE) but it's considered difficult due to the buffer being stored in the global data segment. It can also lead to a crash due to the memory corruption.
- **Attack vectors**: Malicious AQL queries.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to run a crafted malicious AQL query. This can be achieved when using the database in IoT application. The attack vector is considered local.
