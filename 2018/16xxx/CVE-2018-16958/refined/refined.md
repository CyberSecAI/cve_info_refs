  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Oracle WebCenter Interaction (WCI) portal makes use of the primary session cookie in JavaScript. The `httpOnly` attribute is explicitly removed from the session cookie when set, and it cannot be set using the `Web.config` configuration file.",

    ],
    "impact": "The exposure of the session cookie to JavaScript allows an attacker to hijack user sessions through cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities (XSS) can be leveraged to steal the session cookie."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to inject and execute malicious JavaScript in the user's browser through an XSS vulnerability."
