Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-16177:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insecure DLL search path within the installer of the "Windows10 Fall Creators Update Modify module for Security Measures tool" provided by NIPPON TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE WEST CORPORATION.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **DLL Hijacking (CWE-427):** The installer does not properly specify the location of required DLLs, causing it to potentially load malicious DLLs from an attacker-controlled location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the installer. This can lead to full system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack Vector:** An attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- **User Interaction Required:** Exploitation requires the user to run the vulnerable installer.
- **Malicious DLL Placement:** The attacker needs to trick the user into placing a malicious DLL in a specific folder where the installer searches for DLLs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have some form of access to the target system, be it physical or through remote access.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to deceive a user into placing a malicious DLL file in the correct location before running the installer.

**Additional Details:**
- The "Windows10 Fall Creators Update Modify module" was a temporary measure and is no longer needed, as the latest version of the "Security Measures tool" includes this functionality.
- The vulnerability was reported by Tomohisa Hasegawa of Canon IT Solutions Inc.
