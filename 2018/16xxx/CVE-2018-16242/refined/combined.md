# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

Vendor/product description:
-----------------------------
oBike is (was) a Singaporean stationless bicycle-sharing system with operations
in several countries [1].

Introduction:
-------------
The bikes have a built-in Bluetooth lock [2]. Clients use their smartphone to
locate a bicycle. Once nearby, they unlock the bicycle directly from the app or
by scanning a QR code. Unlike traditional rental services, which require bikes
to be returned to a fixed docking station, users are free to leave the bikes
at any suitable bike parking spot.

Affected:
---------
As of August 2018, this issue seems to affect the whole oBike fleet (or what is
left of it).

Technical Description:
----------------------
The oBike lock consists of a TI CC2541 microcontroller, a power-optimized
System on a Chip (SoC) used for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) applications. The
lock itself has no IP connectivity; it piggybacks the mobile device's 3G/4G
connection to communicate with the oBike backend. The lock communicates via
BLE with the oBike app on the mobile device. Protocol messages are then relayed
to the oBike backend via a REST API.

            |                        |                           | billing)

Steps:
(1) BLE send `hello` message, push GPS coordinates to lock.
(2) BLE receive `keySource`, a 32bit value used as a challenge.
(3) HTTPS send `keySource` to oBike backend via the `unlockPass` REST call.
(4) HTTPS receive `encKey` (key index) and a 128bit ciphertext in `keys`.
(5) BLE send `keys` (truncated to 96bits) and the `encKey`. At that point, the
    bike will unlock.
(6) BLE receive `macKey` and `index`, an acknowledgement that the unlocking was
    successful.
(7) HTTPS send `lockMessage`, with the corresponding values (`macKey` and
   `index`). At that point, the oBike backend will register the ride and start
   billing.

A first vulnerability [3] was found prior to this advisory, which consists in
leaving out the acknowledgement in step (7). By omitting this message, the
lock is opened but the ride is not registered at the oBike backend, therefore
not being billed.

Analysis of the `keySource` field (32 bit challenge) in step (2) showed that
the values generated by the lock are not random as expected. Rather, the
values represent the number of milliseconds since the chip was powered on. This
corresponds to a time window of roughly 50 days (2^32 milliseconds).

The 128bit ciphertext in `keys` from step (5) is used to unlock the bike. Its
value as returned by the oBike backend is the result of an unknown cryptographic
operation based on the `keySource` field (generated by the lock), and the
`encKey` value (given by the backend). Taken from the CC2541 specifications
and the length of `keys`, the value corresponds most probably to an AES-128
ciphertext. The `encKey` in turn selects the encryption key from a set of
64 distinct indices, which is chosen randomly by the backend.

Given fixed `keySource` and `encKey` values it was observed that the resulting
`keys` value is always equal, allowing for replay attacks. To this end, all
possible `keySource` values are enumerated and the corresponding `keys` and
`encKey` values captured. It is possible to replay these values offline at a
later point in time.

To limit the number of values to be enumerated, A BLE command was discovered
that provokes a chip reset. Given this condition, the generated `keySource`
lies within a predictable time window, which greatly simplifies the attack.
Now, only several seconds worth of `keySource` values are needed to implement
the replay attack.

A description of the BLE and REST protocols can be found in [4].

Workaround / Fix:
-----------------
No known fix/workaround available. The attack works offline, there is no known
possiblity to detect or to prevent it on the backend.
