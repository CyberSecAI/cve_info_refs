Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the posCMS application.
- It occurs due to the insecure handling of the `dir` parameter in the `index.php?s=member&c=api&m=ajax_save_draft` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The `dir` parameter, which is supposed to specify a directory (in this case 'photo'), is directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The application fails to validate and sanitize the `dir` parameter, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Data Breach:** An attacker can use SQL injection to retrieve sensitive data from the database, including user credentials, personal information, and other confidential data.
- **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the database, leading to data corruption or loss.
- **Remote Code Execution (Potential):** In some cases, SQL injection vulnerabilities can be escalated to remote code execution by leveraging database-specific features.
- **System Compromise:** Complete system takeover is possible depending on database access level.

**Attack vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint (`/index.php?s=member&c=api&m=ajax_save_draft`).
- **`dir` Parameter:** The `dir` parameter is the injection point.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the application server.
- **Basic HTTP knowledge:** Knowledge of how to craft and send HTTP requests is necessary to exploit the vulnerability.
- **SQL injection expertise:** Knowledge of SQL syntax and how to craft malicious SQL queries is necessary.
