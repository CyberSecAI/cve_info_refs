The provided content describes three Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the onethink application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerabilities are present in the following functionalities:
1. Adding a page to the website's homepage (Channel/add.html)
2. Adding a blog post (Article/update.html)
3.  Auditing/approving a blog post (Article/setStatus/status/1.html)

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into unknowingly performing actions that modify the website content by adding new pages with attacker-controlled URLs, creating blog posts and approving them. This could lead to defacement of the website,  phishing attacks, or the spread of malicious content.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves crafting malicious HTML pages that, when loaded by a logged-in administrator, submit forged POST requests to the vulnerable application endpoints.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to lure a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious page that contains the exploit code.
The attacker does not need direct access to the application's server.
