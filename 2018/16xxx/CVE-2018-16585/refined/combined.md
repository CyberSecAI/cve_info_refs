| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1626193#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2018-09-06 17:34:31 UTC  ``` An issue was discovered in Artifex Ghostscript before 9.24. The .setdistillerkeys PostScript command is accepted even though it is not intended for use during document processing (e.g., after the startup phase). This leads to memory corruption, allowing remote attackers able to supply crafted PostScript to crash the interpreter or possibly have unspecified other impact.  References:  <http://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;a=commitdiff;h=1497d65039885a52b598b137dd8622bd4672f9be> <http://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;a=commitdiff;h=971472c83a345a16dac9f90f91258bb22dd77f22> <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2018/q3/182>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1626193#c1)  Pedro Sampaio    2018-09-06 17:35:03 UTC  ``` Created ghostscript tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1626194](show_bug.cgi?id=1626194 "CLOSED RAWHIDE - CVE-2018-16585 ghostscript: .setdistillerkeys PostScript command is accepted even though it is not intended for use [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1626193#c3)  David Kaspar // Dee'Kej    2018-09-07 09:23:32 UTC  ``` So, looking at the commits... The issue was discovered prior to 9.24, which means that for 9.24 (F28+) it is already fixed.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1626193#c7)  Cedric Buissart    2018-11-16 11:30:20 UTC  ``` It appears that this CVE description might not be correct :  * ghostscript does not have a `.setdistillerkeys` command. This was probably a typo, the command targeted might probably be .setdistillerparams * the commits pointed by the CVE as a fix (971472c83a & 1497d650) are dated from gs-9.22 (2017), do not seem to seem to undefine any *distill* parameter, and .setdistillerparams appears to still be accessible after these commits.  * From the above, I believe that the fix for this vulnerability might actually be <http://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;a=commitdiff;h=b0a385475>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1626193#c8)  Cedric Buissart    2018-12-18 10:17:36 UTC  ``` The accessibility of .setdistillerparams does not really represent a security defect.  This CVE is mostly a duplicate of [CVE-2018-15910](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-15910) (fixed via RHSA-2018:3834)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1626193#c11)  Cedric Buissart    2019-10-03 12:43:24 UTC  ``` Statement:  There are no .setdistillerkeys operator in ghostscript. It is suspected it might be a typo from .distillerparamkeys or .setdistillerparams. It was found that .distillerparamkeys and .setdistillerparams methods can be called although they are not intended to be used. However, the only known security threat they cause has been fixed via [CVE-2018-15910](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-15910).   ``` |  |

# Re: Re: More Ghostscript Issues: Should we disable PS coders in policy.xml by default?

Here is an update, Artifex made a press release
<<https://www.darkreading.com/prnewswire2.asp?rkey=20180824UN89145&filter=3930>>
listing
some necessary commits, but the list was incomplete.

Here is a list of relevant commits I'm aware of so far, some issues are
still open with working exploits available. It's my understanding that no
new release is planned until late September, and vendors need to either
ship a git snapshot when all issues are resolved, or apply patches. I have
testcases for each problem, but I think the bugs will be visible eventually
so I'm not posting them here.

# USN-3768-1: Ghostscript vulnerabilities

19 September 2018

Several security issues were fixed in Ghostscript.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [ghostscript](/security/cves?package=ghostscript) - PostScript and PDF interpreter

## Details

Tavis Ormandy discovered multiple security issues in Ghostscript. If a user

or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted file,

a remote attacker could possibly use these issues to access arbitrary

files, execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial of service.

# GPL Ghostscript: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201811-12**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in GPL Ghostscript, the
worst of which could result in the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-text/ghostscript-gpl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **9.26** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **9.26** |

### Background

Ghostscript is an interpreter for the PostScript language and for PDF.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in GPL Ghostscript. Please
review the CVE identifiers referenced below for additional information.

### Impact

A context-dependent attacker could entice a user to open a specially
crafted PostScript file or PDF document using GPL Ghostscript possibly
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
process, a Denial of Service condition, or other unspecified impacts,

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All GPL Ghostscript users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/ghostscript-gpl-9.26"

```

Debian Bug     : 907332 908305 907703

Tavis Ormandy discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Ghostscript, an
interpreter for the PostScript language, which could result in denial of
service, the creation of files or the execution of arbitrary code if a
malformed Postscript file is processed (despite the dSAFER sandbox being
enabled).

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
9.06~dfsg-2+deb8u8.

We recommend that you upgrade your ghostscript packages.
