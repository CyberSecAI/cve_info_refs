Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-16585:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `.setdistillerkeys` (or possibly `.setdistillerparams` due to a likely typo) PostScript command is accepted even though it is not intended for use during document processing. This command should only be used during the startup phase of Ghostscript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unintended Command Accessibility:** The core weakness is that the `.setdistillerkeys` or `.setdistillerparams` command remains accessible outside of its intended startup phase. This allows for manipulation of internal parameters.
*  **Memory Corruption:** Specifically, using this command outside of startup can lead to memory corruption within Ghostscript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Crash:** Exploitation can cause the Ghostscript interpreter to crash.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The memory corruption can potentially be exploited by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code, although this is not explicitly confirmed in all sources, it is strongly suggested.
*  **Denial of Service (DoS):** The crash is a form of denial of service, preventing Ghostscript from functioning correctly.
*  **Other Unspecified Impacts:** Some sources mention possible other unspecified impacts due to memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted PostScript File:** The attack vector involves supplying a specially crafted PostScript file containing the `.setdistillerkeys` (or possibly `.setdistillerparams`) command at an unexpected time.
*  **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker able to supply the crafted PostScript.
*   **Processing of Malformed Files:** An automated system or a user tricked into processing a malicious file is also an attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Supply Crafted PostScript:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious PostScript file to Ghostscript. This can happen through different means:
    *   Remote access to a system processing PostScript
    *   Tricking a user to open such file
    *   Indirectly via another application using ghostscript
*   **No Special Privileges:** No special privileges are explicitly mentioned as needed for the attacker, it is context-dependent with the privileges of the process running Ghostscript.

**Additional Notes:**
*   There's some discussion about whether the command is `.setdistillerkeys` or `.setdistillerparams`, with the latter being more likely and a typo suspected.
* The fix for this issue might be related to commit `b0a385475` which is associated with [CVE-2018-15910](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-15910).
*   The issue was discovered prior to Ghostscript 9.24, and fixed in 9.24 (for some distributions)
*   Multiple other Ghostscript vulnerabilities were fixed around the same time
