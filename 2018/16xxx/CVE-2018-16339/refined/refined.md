Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) flaw in the `AddUser.php` page of the EmpireCMS application. This page is responsible for adding new users, including administrators.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the lack of CSRF protection on the `AddUser.php` page. This allows an attacker to forge a request to add a new administrator without the legitimate administrator's consent.

**Impact of Exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack can allow an attacker to add a new administrator account to the EmpireCMS application. This new administrator account grants the attacker complete control over the application, allowing them to potentially perform any actions, including data theft, modification, or further compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page (`add.html`, based on `add.txt`) containing a form that sends a request to `AddUser.php`.
*   The attacker must induce a logged-in administrator to open the malicious page. This could be through social engineering or by hosting the page on a site they know the admin is likely to visit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable `AddUser.php` script (`/EmpireCMS-master/upload/e/admin/user/AddUser.php?enews=AddUser`).
*   The attacker needs to be able to create and host a malicious HTML file (add.html) containing the crafted request.
*   The attacker needs to be able to get a logged-in administrator to visit the malicious page.

**Additional Details:**
*   The provided screenshots show the expected behavior of the user management page before and after exploitation using the provided CSRF attack payload.
*   The provided `add.txt` file acts as the payload, which when placed inside a HTML file (add.html) and opened by an authenticated admin, will trigger the CSRF vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is specifically in the `AddUser` functionality, which can be exploited to create a new administrator account, granting the attacker control over the CMS.
