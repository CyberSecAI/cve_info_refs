# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

# USN-3826-1: QEMU vulnerabilities

26 November 2018

Several security issues were fixed in QEMU.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [qemu](/security/cves?package=qemu) - Machine emulator and virtualizer

## Details

Daniel Shapira and Arash Tohidi discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled

NE2000 device emulation. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue

to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-10839](/security/CVE-2018-10839))

It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the Slirp networking

back-end. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this issue to

cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code on the host. In the default installation, when QEMU is used

with libvirt, attackers would be isolated by the libvirt AppArmor profile.

This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu

18.04 LTS. ([CVE-2018-11806](/security/CVE-2018-11806))

Fakhri Zulkifli discovered that the QEMU guest agent incorrectly handled

certain QMP commands. An attacker could possibly use this issue to crash

the QEMU guest agent, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-12617](/security/CVE-2018-12617))

Li Qiang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled NVM Express Controller

emulation. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU

to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary

code on the host. In the default installation, when QEMU is used with

libvirt, attackers would be isolated by the libvirt AppArmor profile. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.10. ([CVE-2018-16847](/security/CVE-2018-16847))

Daniel Shapira and Arash Tohidi discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled

RTL8139 device emulation. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue

to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-17958](/security/CVE-2018-17958))

Daniel Shapira and Arash Tohidi discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled

PCNET device emulation. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue

to cause QEMU to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-17962](/security/CVE-2018-17962))

Daniel Shapira discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled large packet sizes.

An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU to crash,

resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-17963](/security/CVE-2018-17963))

It was discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled LSI53C895A device

emulation. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU

to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-18849](/security/CVE-2018-18849))

Moguofang discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the IPowerNV LPC

controller. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU

to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu

18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.10. ([CVE-2018-18954](/security/CVE-2018-18954))

Zhibin Hu discovered that QEMU incorrectly handled the Plan 9 File System

support. An attacker inside the guest could use this issue to cause QEMU

to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-19364](/security/CVE-2018-19364))

Subject: CVE-2018-16847 QEMU: nvme: Out-of-bounds r/w buffer access in cmb
 operations

   Hello,

An OOB heap buffer r/w access issue was found in the NVM Express Controller
emulation in QEMU.  It could occur in nvme_cmb_ops routines in nvme devices. A
guest user/process could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process resulting in
DoS or potentially run arbitrary code with privileges of the QEMU process.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2018-11/msg00200.html>

This issue was found and reported by Li Qiang. 'CVE-2018-16847' assigned by
Red Hat Inc.

Thank you.

```
Currently, the nvme_cmb_ops mr doesn't check the addr and size.
This can lead an oob access issue. This is triggerable in the guest.
Add check to avoid this issue.

Fixes CVE-2018-16847.
