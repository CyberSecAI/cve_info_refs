Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-16847:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds (OOB) heap buffer read/write access issue within the NVM Express (NVMe) Controller emulation of QEMU. Specifically, the `nvme_cmb_ops` routines in NVMe devices lack proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read/write:** The core weakness is the absence of checks on the address and size parameters when accessing the Controller Memory Buffer (CMB) within the NVMe emulation. This allows for memory access beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A guest user or process can exploit this flaw to crash the QEMU process, resulting in a denial of service for the virtual machine.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The vulnerability could potentially be used to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the QEMU process, leading to complete host compromise (Although this is mitigated when QEMU is used with libvirt AppArmor profiles in the default installation).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Guest Access:** The attack vector is through a malicious guest user or process within the virtual machine.
- **NVMe Device Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered by interacting with the emulated NVMe device and its CMB operations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Guest Privileges:** The attacker needs to have some level of control or access within the guest operating system.
- **Knowledge of NVMe:** While the details of exploitation are not fully revealed, the attacker needs to be able to trigger the flawed NVMe CMB operations by sending crafted requests to the emulated device.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects the `nvme_cmb_ops` routines of NVMe devices in QEMU.
- The vulnerability was found and reported by Li Qiang.
- A patch was created to address this vulnerability which adds checks on the addr and size parameters to prevent out-of-bounds memory access.
- This vulnerability affects Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.10 specifically, as well as other systems using affected versions of QEMU.
- Red Hat assigned the CVE identifier.
