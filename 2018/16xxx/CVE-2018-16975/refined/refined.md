Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-16975:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2018-16975. The commit log and issue #286 clearly describe a remote code execution vulnerability in the `/designer/add/stylesheet.php` file of the Elefant CMS, which is the core issue addressed by this CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the stylesheet editor. Specifically, the `/designer/add/stylesheet.php` file allows users to create stylesheets with arbitrary file extensions (like `.php`), and to insert arbitrary code (including PHP code) into the stylesheet content. This code is then saved to the server, and executed when the file is accessed directly.
*   The vulnerable code is present in both `csspreview.php` and `stylesheet.php`.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload/Creation:** The system allows the creation of files with arbitrary extensions, including executable ones like `.php`.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:**  The system does not sanitize or validate the content being saved to stylesheet files, allowing the insertion of arbitrary PHP code.
*  **Insecure file retrieval**: The `csspreview.php` retrieves the CSS file based on a `$_GET['css']` parameter, and directly includes it in the page.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server by creating a malicious stylesheet containing PHP code and then accessing the file directly.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the web server, allowing the attacker to steal data, modify files, or take over the server.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The attacker leverages the web interface to access the stylesheet editor or previewer.
*  **HTTP GET/POST Requests:**  The attacker crafts a request to the stylesheet editor or previewer with the malicious payload.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be logged in as a user with privileges to access the `/designer/add/stylesheet.php` or `csspreview.php` functionality.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided commit log indicates a fix was made to address this issue, including stripping of HTML tags from the stylesheet content, but this is not sufficient to prevent arbitrary PHP code execution. The fix does not prevent the creation of php files.
*   The vulnerability is present in version 2.0.5, and was fixed in version 2.0.7 of Elefant CMS.

In summary, CVE-2018-16975 is a critical vulnerability in Elefant CMS that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server via a specially crafted stylesheet.
