{
  "CVE-2018-16230": {
    "Description": "The BGP parser in tcpdump before 4.9.3 has a buffer over-read in print-bgp.c:bgp_attr_print() (MP_REACH_NLRI).",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a buffer over-read in the `bgp_attr_print` function, specifically when handling MP_REACH_NLRI attributes, due to insufficient length checks on the nexthop value.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer over-read"
    ],
    "Impact": "A successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a denial of service, or potentially, arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network: A remote attacker could send a specially crafted BGP packet, with a malformed MP_REACH_NLRI attribute, to trigger a buffer over-read in `tcpdump`."
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send network traffic, specifically BGP packets, to a system running a vulnerable version of tcpdump. No authentication is needed.",
    "Additional details": "The vulnerability lies in how `tcpdump` parses and displays BGP attributes. When encountering a malformed MP_REACH_NLRI, the `bgp_attr_print` function fails to properly validate the length of the nexthop attribute, which leads to a read past the end of a buffer. This vulnerability was also discovered through code audit by Include Security and independently through fuzzing by Bhargava Shastry, SecT/TU Berlin."
