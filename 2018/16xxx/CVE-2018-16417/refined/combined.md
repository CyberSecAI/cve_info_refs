### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Siemens reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Siemens recommends users upgrade to Version 8.4.0.1 or later, which can be downloaded from the following link:

<https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/us/en/view/109766816/>

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that users can apply to reduce the risk:

* Restrict access to the web-based management interface to the internal or VPN network.
* Do not browse other websites and do not click on external links while being authenticated to the administrative web interface.
* Apply appropriate strategies for mitigation.

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to [Siemens’ operational guidelines for industrial security](https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity), and following the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at:

<https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity>

For more information on these vulnerabilities and associated software updates, please see Siemens security advisory SSA-549547 on their website:

<https://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories>

NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS-CERT website](/ics/) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-7084
