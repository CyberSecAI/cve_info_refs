Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-16842:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `voutf()` function within the `tool_msgs.c` file of the `curl` command-line tool. This function is responsible for formatting output messages, specifically wrapping them at 80-character columns.
*   The flaw is in the wrapping logic, where if a single word in the message exceeds 80 characters, the buffer arithmetic incorrectly calculates the remainder, causing a heap-based buffer over-read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based Buffer Over-read:** The core issue is a buffer over-read in the heap memory. When a long word needs to be wrapped across multiple lines, the code reads beyond the allocated buffer boundaries.
*   **Improper input validation/sanitization:** The code does not properly handle or validate input strings when formatting output messages with the `voutf` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The buffer over-read can potentially expose sensitive data in the memory surrounding the buffer.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The over-read can potentially lead to a crash of the `curl` command-line tool, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered through the command-line interface of the `curl` tool.
*   A remote attacker could potentially exploit it through crafted input that produces long error messages.
*  The issue is triggered by a long word in the output message, which is typically generated by an invalid command-line option passed to the curl tool.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need the ability to execute commands using the vulnerable `curl` tool, either locally or remotely.
*   To trigger the over-read, the attacker would need to supply input that produces a warning/error message containing a word longer than 80 characters. This can be achieved by passing curl a malformed or long command-line option.

**Additional Details and Context from the Content:**

*   **Versions Affected:** curl versions 7.14.1 through 7.61.1 are confirmed to be affected. Some older versions are also affected but the impact is limited due to a smaller buffer being used.
*   **Not in libcurl:** It is important to note that the vulnerability does not affect the `libcurl` library, but only the command-line tool.
*   **Fix:** The issue was fixed in curl 7.62.0 and later by correcting the wrapping logic in the `voutf()` function and limiting the message length in newer versions.
*   **Backporting:** Many Linux distributions backported the fix to their supported versions to avoid introducing any other issues by upgrading to a newer version of curl.

**Summary of the fix:**

* The vulnerability was fixed in the upstream project by commit `d530e92f59ae9bb2d47066c3c460b25d2ffeb211`.
* The fix adjusts the buffer arithmetic when outputting warnings to stderr, preventing the heap-based buffer over-read from occurring.

**Red Hat Specifics:**

* Red Hat assigned CVE-2018-16842 to this vulnerability.
* The vulnerability is rated as having a **Low** security impact in Red Hat products, mainly due to how the vulnerable code is used in a non-critical context.
* Red Hat addressed this vulnerability with the RHSA-2019:2181 security advisory.
* Red Hat also specifies that the vulnerability is triggered by an invalid or malformed command line option and there is no use of this function to print data from remote servers.

**Ubuntu Specifics:**

*   Ubuntu addressed this vulnerability in USN-3805-1 and USN-3805-2.

**Debian Specifics:**

*   Debian addressed the vulnerability with DSA-4331-1 and DLA-1568-1.

**Gentoo Specifics**
* Gentoo issued a GLSA to address this and other CVE's (GLSA 201903-03)
