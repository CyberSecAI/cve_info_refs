Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-16131:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `decodeRequest` and `decodeRequestWith` directives in Akka HTTP, which are used to handle compressed request data (like gzip), did not properly limit the amount of uncompressed data produced during decompression.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unlimited decompression:** The lack of a limit on uncompressed data size allows an attacker to send a relatively small, highly compressed payload (a "zip bomb") that expands to a very large size upon decompression, leading to excessive memory consumption.
*   **Vulnerable Directives:** The `decodeRequest` and `decodeRequestWith` directives, when used with other common directives like `entity(as)`, `toStrict`, or `formField`, are susceptible to this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The primary impact is a denial-of-service attack. The excessive memory usage caused by decompressing a "zip bomb" can lead to an out-of-memory (OOM) error, crashing the server and making it unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** An attacker can send a specially crafted, compressed HTTP request over the network to the vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability in `decodeRequest` and `decodeRequestWith` directives and how to craft an effective "zip bomb".

**Additional Information from the Content:**

*   **Severity:** The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.3 (High).
*   **Affected Versions:** All Akka HTTP versions prior to 10.1.5 and 10.0.14 were affected.
*   **Unaffected Applications:** Play and Lagom applications are not affected because they implement their own content length validations.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability was fixed in Akka HTTP versions 10.1.5 and 10.0.14.
*   **Issue Tracking:** The issue was tracked on GitHub as issue #2137.
*   **Explanation of vulnerability:** The issue arises due to `transformDataBytes` within `decodeRequestWith`, which creates a new non-limitable `HttpEntity`.
