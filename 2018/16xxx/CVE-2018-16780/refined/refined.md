  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can steal cookies of other users, allowing them to log in to other user accounts, and potentially perform actions on their behalf.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects malicious code into a blog comment via the source editor.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs a valid user account to comment on the blog."
