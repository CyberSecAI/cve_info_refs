    "Metadata": {
      "source": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-16888",
      "cvss_v3_base_score": "4.3",
      "cvss_v3_vector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L"
    },
    "Summary": "Multiple NetApp products incorporate systemd. Versions of systemd through 237 are susceptible to a vulnerability which when exploited could lead to Denial of Service (DoS). systemd up to version 237 does not perform any check on the content of the PIDFile file of a service, which may result in systemd killing a process owned by other services when the service the PIDFile belongs to is stopped. In case the PIDFile is owned by unprivileged users (e.g. a service run with a different User field), systemd may kill privileged processes. A local attacker who is able to tamper with the PIDFile of a service may trick systemd into killing processes he would not have permissions to kill, in the moment a privileged user tries to kill the mentioned service.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "systemd does not properly validate the content of PID files before using it to manage processes.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper input validation of PID files",
        "Incorrect handling of PID files leading to incorrect process termination"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to Denial of Service (DoS) due to the termination of arbitrary, including privileged, processes.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local",
       "Network (when services are exposed remotely)"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A local attacker needs to be able to write to the PIDFile of a service. In some cases, a network attacker may be able to trigger the vulnerability on remotely accessible services."
