- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack-based buffer overflow in the AQL parsing logic due to the lack of bounds checking when adding relations to a fixed-size buffer. The `AQL_ADD_RELATION` macro uses `strcpy` to copy relation names into a stack-allocated buffer, `relations`, without verifying if the number of relations or their lengths exceed the buffer's capacity.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow. The `aql_adt` structure contains a fixed-size buffer, `relations`, designed to store relation names. The `AQL_ADD_RELATION` macro, defined to use `strcpy`, copies data into this buffer without any bounds checks. The size and number of allowed relations are defined using the macros `AQL_RELATION_LIMIT` and `RELATION_NAME_LENGTH` respectively. If the number of relations in an AQL query exceeds `AQL_RELATION_LIMIT`, or if any relation name exceeds `RELATION_NAME_LENGTH`, the buffer will overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploiting this vulnerability could lead to:
    - Stack smashing: Overwriting the function's return address and other stack variables.
    - Remote Code Execution: By controlling the overwritten return address, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code.
    - Integrity Issues: Overwriting other values in the `aql_adt` structure can produce unexpected behavior and crashes.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a malicious AQL query that contains more relations than the fixed buffer can handle or relation names exceeding the maximum length.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the capability to submit an crafted AQL query to the vulnerable system. This could be achieved if the attacker has control over the data sent to an IoT application. The attack vector is described as "local" because it assumes the attacker is able to interact with a running service.
