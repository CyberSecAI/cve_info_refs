            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2018-15471 / XSA-270
                              version 3

           Linux netback driver OOB access in hash handling

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Linux's netback driver allows frontends to control mapping of requests
to request queues.  When processing a request to set or change this
mapping, some input validation was missing or flawed.

IMPACT
======

A malicious or buggy frontend may cause the (usually privileged)
backend to make out of bounds memory accesses, potentially resulting
in one or more of privilege escalation, Denial of Service (DoS), or
information leaks.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Linux kernel versions from 4.7 onwards are affected.

MITIGATION
==========

There is no known mitigation.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Felix Wilhelm of Google Project Zero.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.

# USN-3879-2: Linux kernel (Xenial HWE) vulnerabilities

4 February 2019

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-3879-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu

14.04 LTS.

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel could possibly perform an out of bounds write when updating the

journal for an inline file. An attacker could use this to construct a

malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2018-10883](/security/CVE-2018-10883))

Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov discovered that the cleancache subsystem

of the Linux kernel did not properly initialize new files in some

situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information. ([CVE-2018-16862](/security/CVE-2018-16862))

Wei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not

properly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-19407](/security/CVE-2018-19407))

Mathias Payer and Hui Peng discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the

Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-19824](/security/CVE-2018-19824))

Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the USB subsystem in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle size checks when handling an extra USB

descriptor. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-20169](/security/CVE-2018-20169))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Details

It was discovered that the alarmtimer implementation in the Linux kernel

contained an integer overflow vulnerability. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-13053](/security/CVE-2018-13053))

Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly track inode validations. An attacker could use this

to construct a malicious XFS image that, when mounted, could cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-13093](/security/CVE-2018-13093))

Wen Xu discovered that the f2fs file system implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate metadata. An attacker could

use this to construct a malicious f2fs image that, when mounted,

could cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-13097](/security/CVE-2018-13097),

Wen Xu discovered that the HFS+ filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle malformed catalog data in some situations.

An attacker could use this to construct a malicious HFS+ image that, when

mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-14617](/security/CVE-2018-14617))

Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov discovered that the cleancache subsystem

of the Linux kernel did not properly initialize new files in some

situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information. ([CVE-2018-16862](/security/CVE-2018-16862))

Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the USB subsystem in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle size checks when handling an extra USB

descriptor. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-20169](/security/CVE-2018-20169))

It was discovered that a use-after-free error existed in the block layer

subsystem of the Linux kernel when certain failure conditions occurred. A

local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-20856](/security/CVE-2018-20856))

Eli Biham and Lior Neumann discovered that the Bluetooth implementation in

the Linux kernel did not properly validate elliptic curve parameters during

Diffie-Hellman key exchange in some situations. An attacker could use this

to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-5383](/security/CVE-2018-5383))

It was discovered that a heap buffer overflow existed in the Marvell

Wireless LAN device driver for the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2019-10126](/security/CVE-2019-10126))

Andrei Vlad Lutas and Dan Lutas discovered that some x86 processors

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

                 CVE-2019-6974 CVE-2019-7221 CVE-2019-7222 CVE-2019-9213

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2016-10741

    A race condition was discovered in XFS that would result in a
    crash (BUG). A local user permitted to write to an XFS volume
    could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-5753

    Further instances of code that was vulnerable to Spectre variant 1
    (bounds-check bypass) have been mitigated.

CVE-2017-13305

    A memory over-read was discovered in the keys subsystem's
    encrypted key type. A local user could use this for denial of
    service or possibly to read sensitive information.

CVE-2018-3639 (SSB)

    Multiple researchers have discovered that Speculative Store Bypass
    (SSB), a feature implemented in many processors, could be used to
    read sensitive information from another context. In particular,
    code in a software sandbox may be able to read sensitive
    information from outside the sandbox. This issue is also known as
    Spectre variant 4.

    This update fixes bugs in the mitigations for SSB for AMD
    processors.

CVE-2018-5848

    The wil6210 wifi driver did not properly validate lengths in scan
    and connection requests, leading to a possible buffer overflow.
    On systems using this driver, a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability could use this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or potentially for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-5953

    The swiotlb subsystem printed kernel memory addresses to the
    system log, which could help a local attacker to exploit other
    vulnerabilities.

CVE-2018-12896, CVE-2018-13053

    Team OWL337 reported possible integer overflows in the POSIX
    timer implementation. These might have some security impact.

CVE-2018-16862

    Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov from Virtuozzo Kernel Team
    discovered that the cleancache memory management feature did not
    invalidate cached data for deleted files. On Xen guests using the
    tmem driver, local users could potentially read data from other
    users' deleted files if they were able to create new files on the
    same volume.

CVE-2018-16884

    A flaw was found in the NFS 4.1 client implementation. Mounting
    NFS shares in multiple network namespaces at the same time could
    lead to a user-after-free. Local users might be able to use this
    for denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

    This can be mitigated by disabling unprivileged users from
    creating user namespaces, which is the default in Debian.

CVE-2018-17972

    Jann Horn reported that the /proc/*/stack files in procfs leaked
    sensitive data from the kernel. These files are now only readable
    by users with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (usually only root)

CVE-2018-18281

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the virtual memory manager
    that can result in a process briefly having access to memory after
    it is freed and reallocated. A local user permitted to create
    containers could possibly exploit this for denial of service
    (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-18690

    Kanda Motohiro reported that XFS did not correctly handle some
    xattr (extended attribute) writes that require changing the disk
    format of the xattr. A user with access to an XFS volume could use
    this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-18710

    It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_SELECT_DISC ioctl. A user with
    access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-19824

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a use-after-free bug in the
    USB audio driver. A physically present attacker able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2018-19985

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a missing bounds check in the
    hso USB serial driver. A physically present user able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-20169

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered missing bounds checks in the
    USB core. A physically present attacker able to attach a specially
    designed USB device could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-20511

    InfoSect reported an information leak in the AppleTalk IP/DDP
    implemntation. A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could
    use this to read sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-3701

    Muyu Yu and Marcus Meissner reported that the CAN gateway
    implementation allowed the frame length to be modified, typically
    resulting in out-of-bounds memory-mapped I/O writes.  On a system
    with CAN devices present, a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability in the initial net namespace could use this to cause a
    crash (oops) or other hardware-dependent impact.

CVE-2019-3819

    A potential infinite loop was discovered in the HID debugfs
    interface exposed under /sys/kernel/debug/hid. A user with access
    to these files could use this for denial of service.

    This interface is only accessible to root by default, which fully
    mitigates the issue.

CVE-2019-6974

    Jann Horn reported a use-after-free bug in KVM. A local user
    with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-7221

    Jim Mattson and Felix Wilhelm reported a user-after-free bug in
    KVM's nested VMX implementation. On systems with Intel CPUs, a
    local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

    Nested VMX is disabled by default, which fully mitigates the
    issue.

CVE-2019-7222

    Felix Wilhelm reported an information leak in KVM for x86.
    A local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to read
    sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-9213

    Jann Horn reported that privileged tasks could cause stack
    segments, including those in other processes, to grow downward to
    address 0. On systems lacking SMAP (x86) or PAN (ARM), this
    exacerbated other vulnerabilities: a null pointer dereference
    could be exploited for privilege escalation rather than only for
    denial of service.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.64-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

Debian Bug     : 925919

The linux update issued as DLA-1731-1 caused a regression in the
vmxnet3 (VMware virtual network adapter) driver.  This update corrects
that regression, and an earlier regression in the CIFS network
filesystem implementation introduced in DLA-1422-1.  For reference the
original advisory text follows.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

    tmem driver, local users could potentially read data from other
    users' deleted files if they were able to create new files on the
    same volume.

CVE-2018-16884

    A flaw was found in the NFS 4.1 client implementation. Mounting
    NFS shares in multiple network namespaces at the same time could
    lead to a user-after-free. Local users might be able to use this
    for denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

    This can be mitigated by disabling unprivileged users from
    creating user namespaces, which is the default in Debian.

CVE-2018-17972

    Jann Horn reported that the /proc/*/stack files in procfs leaked
    sensitive data from the kernel. These files are now only readable
    by users with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (usually only root)

CVE-2018-18281

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the virtual memory manager
    that can result in a process briefly having access to memory after
    it is freed and reallocated. A local user permitted to create
    containers could possibly exploit this for denial of service
    (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-18690

    Kanda Motohiro reported that XFS did not correctly handle some
    xattr (extended attribute) writes that require changing the disk
    format of the xattr. A user with access to an XFS volume could use
    this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-18710

    It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_SELECT_DISC ioctl. A user with
    access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-19824

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a use-after-free bug in the
    USB audio driver. A physically present attacker able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2018-19985

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a missing bounds check in the
    hso USB serial driver. A physically present user able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-20169

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered missing bounds checks in the
    USB core. A physically present attacker able to attach a specially
    designed USB device could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-20511

    InfoSect reported an information leak in the AppleTalk IP/DDP
    implemntation. A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could
    use this to read sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-3701

    Muyu Yu and Marcus Meissner reported that the CAN gateway
    implementation allowed the frame length to be modified, typically
    resulting in out-of-bounds memory-mapped I/O writes.  On a system
    with CAN devices present, a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability in the initial net namespace could use this to cause a
    crash (oops) or other hardware-dependent impact.

CVE-2019-3819

    A potential infinite loop was discovered in the HID debugfs
    interface exposed under /sys/kernel/debug/hid. A user with access
    to these files could use this for denial of service.

    This interface is only accessible to root by default, which fully
    mitigates the issue.

CVE-2019-6974

    Jann Horn reported a use-after-free bug in KVM. A local user
    with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-7221

    Jim Mattson and Felix Wilhelm reported a user-after-free bug in
    KVM's nested VMX implementation. On systems with Intel CPUs, a
    local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

    Nested VMX is disabled by default, which fully mitigates the
    issue.

CVE-2019-7222

    Felix Wilhelm reported an information leak in KVM for x86.
    A local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to read
    sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-9213

    Jann Horn reported that privileged tasks could cause stack
    segments, including those in other processes, to grow downward to
    address 0. On systems lacking SMAP (x86) or PAN (ARM), this
    exacerbated other vulnerabilities: a null pointer dereference
    could be exploited for privilege escalation rather than only for
    denial of service.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.64-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1047-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws)
  -
  [4.15.0-1047.49](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws/4.15.0-1047.49)
* [linux-image-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws)
  -
  [4.15.0.1047.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws/4.15.0.1047.46)

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1047-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-1047.49~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws-hwe/4.15.0-1047.49~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-aws-hwe](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0.1047.47](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws-hwe/4.15.0.1047.47)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel
* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-kvm](/security/cves?package=linux-kvm) - Linux kernel for cloud environments

## Details

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel could possibly perform an out of bounds write when updating the

journal for an inline file. An attacker could use this to construct a

malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2018-10883](/security/CVE-2018-10883))

Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov discovered that the cleancache subsystem

of the Linux kernel did not properly initialize new files in some

situations. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information. ([CVE-2018-16862](/security/CVE-2018-16862))

Wei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not

properly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-19407](/security/CVE-2018-19407))

Mathias Payer and Hui Peng discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the

Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-19824](/security/CVE-2018-19824))

Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the USB subsystem in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle size checks when handling an extra USB

descriptor. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-20169](/security/CVE-2018-20169))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# CVE-2018-16862: Linux kernel: cleancache: deleted files infoleak

```
Heololo,

Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov from Virtuozzo Kernel Team
found way for an unprivileged user to access a content of a deleted file
of any other users on a file systems with enabled cleancache.

Under certain conditions it may not drop a content of a deleted
file on its last iput(). When a newly created file gets an inode number
of the previously deleted file its read can get the content of the deleted
file saved in cleancache.

For now only Xen's tmem driver registers itself as a backend for cleancache:

$ git grep cleancache_register_ops
...
drivers/xen/tmem.c:             err = cleancache_register_ops(&tmem_cleancache_ops);
mm/cleancache.c:int cleancache_register_ops(const struct cleancache_ops *ops)

This means only Xen's guests with tmem driver active are vulnerable.

Debian Bug     : 890034 896911 907581 915229 915231

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-18249

    A race condition was discovered in the disk space allocator of
    F2FS. A user with access to an F2FS volume could use this to cause
    a denial of service or other security impact.

CVE-2018-1128, CVE-2018-1129

    The cephx authentication protocol used by Ceph was susceptible to
    replay attacks, and calculated signatures incorrectly. These
    vulnerabilities in the server required changes to authentication
    that are incompatible with existing clients. The kernel's client
    code has now been updated to be compatible with the fixed server.

CVE-2018-3639 (SSB)

    Multiple researchers have discovered that Speculative Store Bypass
    (SSB), a feature implemented in many processors, could be used to
    read sensitive information from another context. In particular,
    code in a software sandbox may be able to read sensitive
    information from outside the sandbox. This issue is also known as
    Spectre variant 4.

    This update adds a further mitigation for this issue in the eBPF
    (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) implementation.

CVE-2018-5391 (FragmentSmack)

    Juha-Matti Tilli discovered a flaw in the way the Linux kernel
    handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote
    attacker can take advantage of this flaw to trigger time and
    calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithms by sending
    specially crafted packets, leading to remote denial of service.

    This was previously mitigated by reducing the default limits on
    memory usage for incomplete fragmented packets. This update
    replaces that mitigation with a more complete fix.

CVE-2018-5848

    The wil6210 wifi driver did not properly validate lengths in scan
    and connection requests, leading to a possible buffer overflow.
    On systems using this driver, a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability could use this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or potentially for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-12896, CVE-2018-13053

    Team OWL337 reported possible integer overflows in the POSIX
    timer implementation. These might have some security impact.

CVE-2018-13096, CVE-2018-13097, CVE-2018-13100, CVE-2018-14614,
CVE-2018-14616

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted F2FS volumes
    could trigger a crash (BUG, Oops, or division by zero) and/or
    out-of-bounds memory access. An attacker able to mount such a
    volume could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-13406

    Dr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported a potential integer overflow
    in the uvesafb driver. A user with permission to access such a
    device might be able to use this for denial of service or
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-14610, CVE-2018-14611, CVE-2018-14612, CVE-2018-14613

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted Btrfs volumes
    could trigger a crash (Oops) and/or out-of-bounds memory access.
    An attacker able to mount such a volume could use this to cause a
    denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-15471 ((XSA-270)

    Felix Wilhelm of Google Project Zero discovered a flaw in the hash
    handling of the xen-netback Linux kernel module. A malicious or
    buggy frontend may cause the (usually privileged) backend to make
    out of bounds memory accesses, potentially resulting in privilege
    escalation, denial of service, or information leaks.

    <https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-270.html>

CVE-2018-16862

    Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov from Virtuozzo Kernel Team
    discovered that the cleancache memory management feature did not
    invalidate cached data for deleted files. On Xen guests using the
    tmem driver, local users could potentially read data from other
    users' deleted files if they were able to create new files on the
    same volume.

CVE-2018-17972

    Jann Horn reported that the /proc/*/stack files in procfs leaked
    sensitive data from the kernel. These files are now only readable
    by users with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (usually only root)

CVE-2018-18281

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the virtual memory manager
    that can result in a process briefly having access to memory after
    it is freed and reallocated. A local user could possibly exploit
    this for denial of service (memory corruption) or for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2018-18690

    Kanda Motohiro reported that XFS did not correctly handle some
    xattr (extended attribute) writes that require changing the disk
    format of the xattr. A user with access to an XFS volume could use
    this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-18710

    It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_SELECT_DISC ioctl. A user with
    access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-19407

    Wei Wu reported a potential crash (Oops) in the KVM implementation
    for x86 processors. A user with access to /dev/kvm could use this
    for denial of service.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.144-3.1~deb8u1.  This version also includes fixes for Debian bugs
#890034, #896911, #907581, #915229, and #915231; and other fixes
included in upstream stable updates.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.9 packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1649017#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2018-11-12 17:47:55 UTC  ``` A security flaw was found in the Linux kernel in a way that the cleancache subsystem clears an inode after the final file truncation (removal). The new file created with the same inode may contain leftover pages from cleancache and so the old file data instead of the new one.  References:  <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2018/q4/169>  A suggested patch:  <https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/1011367/>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1649017#c3)  Vladis Dronov    2018-11-23 15:10:08 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Vasily Averin (Virtuozzo Kernel Team), Pavel Tikhomirov (Virtuozzo Kernel Team)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1649017#c4)  Vladis Dronov    2018-11-23 15:32:16 UTC  ``` Note:  While RHEL-ALT and RHEL-8 are vulnerable to this flaw, only Xen's [tmem] driver is a possible backend for the CleanCache subsystem. So, a vulnerable configuration is RHEL as a Xen's guest. According to <https://access.redhat.com/certified-hypervisors> this is not a supported configuration, and so the flaw is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1649017#c5)  Sam Fowler    2018-11-26 00:05:03 UTC  ``` External Reference:  <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2018/q4/169>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1649017#c6)  Sam Fowler    2018-11-26 00:06:11 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1653122](show_bug.cgi?id=1653122 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-16862 kernel: cleancache: Infoleak of deleted files after reuse of old inodes [fedora-all]")]   ``` |  |
