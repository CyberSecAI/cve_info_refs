  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2018-16190",
    "description": "UNLHA32.DLL, UNARJ32.DLL, LHMelting and LMLzh32.DLL provided by Micco contain a vulnerability. They insecurely load specific DLL files from the same directory.  This can lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the running application.",
    "affected_modules": [
      "UNLHA32.DLL for Win32 Ver 2.67.1.2 and earlier",
      "UNARJ32.DLL for Win32 Ver 1.10.1.25 and earlier",
      "LHMelting for Win32 Ver 1.65.3.6 and earlier",
      "LMLzh32.DLL Ver 2.67.1.2 and earlier"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerable DLLs load other DLLs from the same directory without proper validation, leading to a DLL hijacking vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the running application.",
    "attack_vector": "Local. An attacker places a malicious DLL in the same directory as the vulnerable application or library, and the malicious DLL is loaded instead of the intended one.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to write files to the same directory as the vulnerable application or library.",
     "additional_notes": "The vulnerability occurs due to the way Windows loads DLLs. When an application loads a DLL, Windows searches a specific list of directories, starting with the application's directory. This vulnerability is not unique to these libraries. It affects many other Windows programs. The vulnerability lies within the Windows system's DLL loading mechanism (NTDLL.DLL) rather than in the vulnerable libraries themselves.  This means that the vulnerable libraries cannot directly fix this by using SetDefaultDllDirectories or similar APIs. However, developers can reduce the risk by installing their programs under the \"C:\\Program Files\" folder or similar protected directories. The vulnerability can be mitigated by updating to the latest versions of the libraries.  For older Windows versions, additional steps may be required, such as applying KB2533623 and denying execution of certain DLLs like SSPICLI.DLL and APPHELP.DLL from outside the system directory. The vulnerability can also be mitigated if the calling program does not use the vulnerable DLLs, or uses an alternative method to the vulnerable DLLs or use a different DLL. Self-extracting archives should be executed only if no other files exist in the same directory and archives should be extracted using archiving tools rather than executing them directly.  This vulnerability is similar to MHSVI#20100824.  The updated libraries are not a complete fix.  The vulnerability will still exist for Windows XP and previous versions, and may resurface due to OS updates and third party software changes. Windows Vista is not completely fixable due to how APPHELP.DLL is loaded. Windows 7 requires additional steps for SSPICLI.DLL.  The vulnerability is not present in English-only versions, only when Japanese language support is present. If the calling program does not address the vulnerability then changes to UNLHA32.DLL, UNARJ32.DLL, LHMelting and LMLzh32.DLL, will not fix the problem."
