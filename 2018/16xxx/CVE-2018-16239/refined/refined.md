Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities described:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Part 1: Force Authentication:** The application uses a timestamp-based cookie for admin authentication. The timestamp is generated using PHP's `time()` function, and the cookie is valid for 3 hours. This predictable timestamp allows an attacker to brute-force the correct cookie value.
*   **Part 2: Remote Code Execution:** The application allows modification of template files. By injecting PHP code into a template file, an attacker can achieve remote code execution.
*   **Part 3: Directory Traversal:** The application does not properly sanitize file paths when handling template files, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files using directory traversal techniques.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Predictable Authentication Cookie:** The use of a time-based cookie with a predictable structure makes brute-force attacks feasible.
*   **Unrestricted Template Modification:** The ability to edit template files with arbitrary content directly allows for code injection.
*   **Directory Traversal:**  The application lacks proper input validation of file paths, leading to directory traversal vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Part 1: Force Authentication:** An attacker can gain administrative access to the application.
*   **Part 2: Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Part 3: Directory Traversal:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Part 1: Force Authentication:** Send HTTP requests with crafted cookie values, brute-forcing the timestamp part of the cookie.
*   **Part 2: Remote Code Execution:** Send a POST request to the `Tpl/Update.html` endpoint with malicious PHP code injected into a template file.
*  **Part 3: Directory Traversal:** Send a GET request to the `Tpl/Add` endpoint with a crafted file path that includes directory traversal sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Part 1: Force Authentication:** Network access to the application, ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests.
*   **Part 2: Remote Code Execution:** Needs to obtain admin level access through the authentication bypass.
*   **Part 3: Directory Traversal:** Needs to obtain admin level access through the authentication bypass.
