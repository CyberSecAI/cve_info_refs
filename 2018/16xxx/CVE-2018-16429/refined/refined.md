  "CVE-2018-16429": {
    "description": "It was discovered that GLib incorrectly handled certain files. An attacker could possibly use this issue to access sensitive information.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `g_utf8_get_char` function within GLib, which is called during error handling in `g_markup_parse_context_parse`. When parsing an invalid UTF-8 string, `g_utf8_get_char` might attempt to read beyond the bounds of the input buffer while trying to determine the length of a UTF-8 character sequence.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially read sensitive information from memory due to the out-of-bounds read.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting a malicious input string with invalid UTF-8 encoding that triggers the error handling code path in g_markup_parse_context_parse."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide input to a function that utilizes `g_markup_parse_context_parse`, which in turn uses `g_utf8_get_char` during error handling. "
