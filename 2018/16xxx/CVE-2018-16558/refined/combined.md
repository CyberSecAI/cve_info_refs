view/109478459

SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU family (incl.
ET200 CPUs and SIPLUS variants):
All versions <= V1.8.5

related

Update to V2.5 or higher or when this is not pos-
sible (because of Hardware restrictions) see rec-
ommendations from section workarouns and miti-
gations

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Protect network access to port 80/tcp and port 443/tcp of affected devices.

• Apply cell protection concept

• Apply defense-in-depth

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-16558

Specially crafted network packets sent to port 80/tcp or 443/tcp could allow an unauthenticated remote
attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service condition of the device.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected systems
on port 80/tcp or 443/tcp. Successful exploitation requires no system privileges and no user interaction.
An attacker could use the vulnerability to compromise availability of the device.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.
