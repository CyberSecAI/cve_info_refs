- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation when processing network packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The device does not properly validate specially crafted network packets sent to port 80/tcp or 443/tcp. This is identified as CWE-20: Improper Input Validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition on the affected device, compromising its availability.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending specially crafted network packets to the device on port 80/tcp or 443/tcp.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the affected systems and does not require any system privileges or user interaction.
