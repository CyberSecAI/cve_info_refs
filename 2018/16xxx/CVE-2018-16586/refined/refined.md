Response:
```
Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability stems from insufficient filtering of HTML content in emails, specifically in the handling of `style` attributes and `src`/`poster` attributes within HTML tags.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The system does not properly sanitize or remove external resource loading URLs from CSS `style` attributes, or from `src`/`poster` attributes of HTML tags. This allows malicious URLs to be embedded within emails.

Impact of exploitation: When a user opens a malicious email, the embedded HTML can force their browser to load external resources (images, CSS, etc.) from attacker-controlled servers. This can lead to information disclosure, where the attacker learns that a user viewed the email or other client-side attacks.

Attack vectors: The attack vector is through crafted emails that include malicious HTML content.

Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs the ability to send emails to the OTRS system. They don't require any prior access to the system other than this ability to send emails. The attack requires user interaction (opening the email) to be successful.
