This was for example the case for loopback devices or devices listed in the `/dev/disk/by-path/` directory. Consequently, the `lvm batch` subcommand failed. with this update, `ceph-volume` uses the `lsblk` command to determine if a device is rotational if no information is found in `/sys/block/` for the given device. As a result, `lvm batch` works as expected in this case. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2019-08-21 15:10:24 UTC | | | Embargoed: |  | | | [Dependent Products:](page.cgi?id=fields.html#dependent_products "Other Products that are affected by this bug.") | Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation Red Hat OpenStack | | Flags: | kholtz: needinfo- | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1666822#c0)  John Fulton    2019-01-16 16:39:32 UTC  ``` When using ceph-volume with ceph-nautilus (dev) [1] via ceph-ansible master and passing a loopback device [2] for the disk my deployment fails because the generated dictionary does not container the key 'rotational'. Could ceph-volume please handle this case and populate the dictionary to have a 'rotational' key? I'm not sure if the value the key maps to matters for this case.  Though loopback devices shouldn't be used in production, OpenStack's TripleO CI system uses a loopback device to simulate a block device for ceph deployment and this issue prevents us getting our CI working with ceph-volume (it currently works with ceph-disk) with the limited resources we have.

However, there are a couple of things here that should be noted:  1) this is still a bug, where ceph-volume is trusting that device objects will always have the "rotational" flag, the device would still be rejected but with an error message (vs. a traceback like today)  2) it is possible to get ceph-volume to work with loop devices and save resources, this is how ceph-volume is able to test rotational+NVMe devices for example. In short:  - finds an available loop device  - creates a sparse file  - attaches the sparse file onto the loop device  - tells NVMe to make a target out of it  The last portion sets everything right with the kernel recognizing the loop device as a new NVMe device. The playbook is at:  <https://github.com/ceph/ceph/blob/master/src/ceph-volume/ceph_volume/tests/functional/batch/playbooks/setup_mixed_type.yml>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1666822#c3)  John Fulton    2019-02-14 19:49:15 UTC  ``` (In reply to Alfredo Deza from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=1666822#c1)) > I understand the need for using loop back devices, but these aren't > supported for ceph-volume and I don't foresee adding that as a feature. >  > However, there are a couple of things here that should be noted: >  > 1) this is still a bug, where ceph-volume is trusting that device objects > will always have the "rotational" flag, the device would still be rejected > but with an error message (vs. a traceback like today)  OK, I'm fine with you using this bug to solve the above issue if that's what you'd like to do.   > 2) it is possible to get ceph-volume to work with loop devices and save > resources, this is how ceph-volume is able to test rotational+NVMe devices > for example.

The playbook is at: >  > <https://github.com/ceph/ceph/blob/master/src/ceph-volume/ceph_volume/tests/> > functional/batch/playbooks/setup_mixed_type.yml  Thanks, that's a nice trick to simulate having NVMe devices so that I could continue to use 'ceph-volume batch' on loopback devices.  For TripleO CI I found another way to use loopback devices without using the deprecated [1] collocated or non-collocated osd_scenarios, which is to simply not use 'ceph-volume batch' mode. So in this case I just pass the info about a precreated LVM. When I do that it doesn't hit this issue.  sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/lib/ceph-osd.img bs=1 count=0 seek=7G sudo losetup /dev/loop3 /var/lib/ceph-osd.img sudo pvcreate /dev/loop3 sudo vgcreate vg2 /dev/loop3 sudo lvcreate -n data-lv2 -l 597 vg2 sudo lvcreate -n db-lv2 -l 597 vg2 sudo lvcreate -n wal-lv2 -l 597 vg2  and then in my THT pass  parameter_defaults:   CephAnsibleDisksConfig:     osd_scenario: lvm     osd_objectstore: bluestore     lvm_volumes:       - data: data-lv2         data_vg: vg2         db: db-lv2         db_vg: vg2         wal: wal-lv2         wal_vg: vg2  It worked on my testing VM with a loopback so I'll try having TripleO CI create the LVM structure before running ceph-ansible.  [1] <https://github.com/ceph/ceph-ansible/blob/master/docs/source/osds/scenarios.rst#collocated>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1666822#c4)  John Fulton    2019-03-11 18:06:25 UTC  ``` I have received reports of people hitting this issue even when they are not using loopback devices so I am updated the bug title. I have asked them to update this bug with their lsblk output. The issue is more serious if people are hitting it with real disks.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1666822#c5)  Keith Plant    2019-03-11 18:26:01 UTC  ``` I am seeing the same behavior with 24 real disks, 20 spinning and 4 solid state. Just for the record I am using docker instead of podman.  lsblk is able to determine whether or not the disks are rotating or not:  [heat-admin@overcloud-cephstorage-0 ~]$ lsblk -d -o ROTA $(for i in {a..x}; do echo -n "/dev/sd$i "; done) ROTA    0    0    0    0    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1    1   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1666822#c17)  John Fulton    2019-03-28 21:07:58 UTC  ``` (In reply to Jeremy from [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=1666822#c15)) > The mentioned workaround <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3954161> says > "If you don't want to use the ceph-volume batch feature and have direct > control of what disk gets picked for what, then you may create LVM volumes > directly on the devices with an OSPd preboot script" .. Could we get that > script or some directions to give our customers how to do that.  You can have director run any script on first boot as described here:   <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html/advanced_overcloud_customization/chap-configuration_hooks#sect-Customizing_Configuration_on_First_Boot>  Instead of having the embedded bash script in the example above echo a line into /etc/resolv.conf, you could have it create LVMs with the lvcreate command something like:    config: |     #!/bin/bash     pvcreate {{ ceph_loop_device }}     vgcreate {{ ceph_logical_volume_group }} {{ ceph_loop_device }}     lvcreate -n {{ ceph_logical_volume_wal }} -l 375 {{ ceph_logical_volume_group }}     lvcreate -n {{ ceph_logical_volume_db }} -l 375 {{ ceph_logical_volume_group }}     lvcreate -n {{ ceph_logical_volume_data }} -l 1041 {{ ceph_logical_volume_group }}     lvs  Naturally you'll need to change the sizes and the LVM names based on what you choose. So this example:  parameter_defaults:   CephAnsibleDisksConfig:     osd_objectstore: bluestore     osd_scenario: lvm     lvm_volumes:       - data: ceph_lv_data         data_vg: ceph_vg         db: ceph_lv_db         db_vg: ceph_vg         wal: ceph_lv_wal         wal_vg: ceph_vg  We could set:  {{ ceph_logical_volume_group }} to ceph_vg {{ ceph_logical_volume_wal }} to ceph_lv_wal {{ ceph_logical_volume_data }} to ceph_lv_data {{ ceph_logical_volume_db }} to ceph_lv_db  That's for ONE pv which would be {{ ceph_loop_device }}. If the devices list is longer the above would need to be expanded.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1666822#c20)  John Fulton    2019-03-29 03:01:26 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1549277](attachment.cgi?id=1549277 "Example workaround for OSPd") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1549277&action=edit "Example workaround for OSPd") Example workaround for OSPd   ```  [Comment 48](show_bug.cgi?id=1666822#c48)  Andrew Schoen    2019-07-18 14:34:30 UTC  ``` (In reply to Siggy Sigwald from [comment #46](show_bug.cgi?id=1666822#c46)) > A message from our customer on the support case: >  > Looking at the BZ, it looks like it s targetted for ceph 3.3 - we are > unfortunatly not able to wait for that to release due to date constraints > for our release. > Would you be able to provide us with a way to patch this fix into the > existing 3.2 , not entirely sure where the fix needs to go, ceph container > image or the overcloud image, but having this would be much more easier for > us to implement than the previously proposed workaround where we need to > "manually" create the vlm's  > thanks >  > Please advice. > Thanks.  Siggy,  Unfortunately there is just too much change between 3.2 and 3.3 and it is not possible to deliver a simple patch here. It requires many of the changes present in 3.3 to implement a fix.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

I don't know why we currently don't return values for x-amz-version-id and x-amz-request-id, and will look into that.  Since x-amz-id-2 is documented as having an opaque value used by Amazon for debugging, I doubt we would choose to return it.

So the only case in which we do not return a value for x-amz-version-id is in the no-version/versioning suspended case--where Amazon AWS would return 'x-amz-version-id: null'.  Probably we should do the same.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 19.04](/security/notices?release=disco)
* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [ceph](/security/cves?package=ceph) - distributed storage and file system

## Details

It was discovered that Ceph incorrectly handled read only permissions. An

authenticated attacker could use this issue to obtain dm-crypt encryption

keys. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2018-14662](/security/CVE-2018-14662))

It was discovered that Ceph incorrectly handled certain OMAPs holding

bucket indices. An authenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to

cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

([CVE-2018-16846](/security/CVE-2018-16846))

It was discovered that Ceph incorrectly sanitized certain debug logs. A

local attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain encryption key

information. This issue was only addressed in Ubuntu 18.10 and Ubuntu

19.04. ([CVE-2018-16889](/security/CVE-2018-16889))

It was discovered that Ceph incorrectly handled certain civetweb requests.

A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to consume resources,

leading to a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.10 and

Ubuntu 19.04. ([CVE-2019-3821](/security/CVE-2019-3821))
