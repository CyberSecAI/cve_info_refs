{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Ceph RGW (RADOS Gateway) did not properly sanitize encryption keys in debug logging for v4 authentication.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Exposure of Sensitive Information",
       "Insecure Logging"
    ],
    "impact": "Encryption keys could be inadvertently disclosed in plaintext within log files, potentially allowing unauthorized access to data protected by those keys.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A local attacker who has access to Ceph log files",
      "A remote attacker who has access to shared log files"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Access to the log files where the sensitive information is logged, which can be achieved locally or remotely depending on logging configuration and access control."
