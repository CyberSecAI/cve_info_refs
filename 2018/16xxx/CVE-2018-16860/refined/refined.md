  "CVE-2018-16860": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Heimdal KDC in Samba does not validate if the checksum algorithm protecting the user name (principal) in an S4U2Self request is keyed.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is in the Heimdal KDC component of Samba, specifically during the processing of S4U2Self requests. The KDC fails to verify that the checksum used to protect the user principal is generated using a keyed algorithm, which is a weakness in input validation",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A man-in-the-middle attacker could intercept the request to the KDC, modify the username in the request with any desired user name (principal) that exists in the KDC, replace the checksum protecting that name with a CRC32 checksum, obtain a ticket for that principal and potentially gain unauthorized access with the privileges of the modified principal.",
       "Attack vectors": "A man-in-the-middle attack on the network between a client and the KDC.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be positioned on the network to intercept and modify communication between a client and the Kerberos KDC and requires a single, valid set of credentials."
    },
      {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A flaw in samba's Heimdal KDC implementation when used in AD DC mode. Specifically, the KDC doesn't confirm that the checksum algorithm is keyed, when checking the checksum in S4U2Self packets.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The Heimdal KDC implementation in Samba doesn't verify if the checksum algorithm on S4U2Self packets is keyed. This allows the attacker to replace it with a non-keyed checksum (such as CRC32).",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A man-in-the-middle attacker could replace the username (principal) in the request with another user's name, and compute a valid CRC32 checksum for it, obtaining a ticket with that modified identity. This would allow the attacker to impersonate the victim user to access resources.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by a man-in-the-middle attack.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker in a privileged network position to intercept requests to the KDC."
    },
     {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Heimdal KDC in Samba did not confirm that the checksum algorithm used for the PA-S4U2Self packet was keyed.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The Heimdal KDC did not validate the checksum algorithm used for PA-S4U2Self packets, and the checksum could be replaced with a CRC32 checksum.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A man-in-the-middle attacker could modify the S4U2Self ticket to impersonate another user, which could lead to unauthorized access and privilege escalation.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack is conducted by intercepting traffic between a client and the KDC.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be in a privileged network position and be able to intercept requests to the KDC."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Heimdal KDC implementation in Samba, when used in Active Directory (AD) Domain Controller (DC) mode, fails to confirm that the checksum algorithm used in PA-S4U2Self packets is keyed.",
       "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the improper validation of the checksum algorithm in S4U2Self requests. Instead of verifying a keyed checksum is used, the implementation accepts any checksum, allowing for manipulation by the attacker.",
       "Impact of exploitation": "A man-in-the-middle attacker can intercept a request to the KDC, modify the requested user principal, recalculate the checksum using CRC32 which does not require a secret and receive a ticket containing the Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC) of a user they did not initially request. The attacker can then use this to access resources they would normally be denied. The attacker can thus impersonate the target user.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack occurs through a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack where the attacker intercepts the request to the KDC.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be positioned on the network to intercept communication between a client and the KDC. The attacker must be able to alter the user principal in the request and recompute the checksum."
