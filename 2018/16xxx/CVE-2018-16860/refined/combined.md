openSUSE Security Update: Security update for libheimdal
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2019:1888-1
Rating: moderate
References: #1047218 #1084909
Cross-References: CVE-2018-16860 CVE-2019-12098
Affected Products:
openSUSE Backports SLE-15-SP1
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes two vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
This update for libheimdal fixes the following issues:
libheimdal was updated to version 7.7.0:
+ Bug fixes:
- PKCS#11 hcrypto back-end:
+ initialize the p11\_module\_load function list
+ verify that not only is a mechanism present but that its mechanism
info states that it offers the required encryption, decryption or
digest services
- krb5:
+ Starting with 7.6, Heimdal permitted requesting authenticated
anonymous tickets. However, it did not verify that a KDC in fact
returned an anonymous ticket when one was requested.
+ Cease setting the KDCOption reaquest\_anonymous flag when issuing
S4UProxy (constrained delegation) TGS requests.
+ when the Win2K PKINIT compatibility option is set, do not require
krbtgt otherName to match when validating KDC certificate.
+ set PKINIT\_BTMM flag per Apple implementation
+ use memset\_s() instead of memset()
- kdc:
+ When generating KRB5SignedPath in the AS, use the reply client name
rather than the one from the request, so validation will work
correctly in the TGS.
+ allow checksum of PA-FOR-USER to be HMAC\_MD5. Even if TGT used an
enctype with a different checksum. Per [MS-SFU] 2.2.1 PA-FOR-USER
the checksum is always HMAC\_MD5, and that's what Windows and MIT
clients send. In Heimdal both the client and kdc use instead the
checksum of the TGT, and therefore work with each other but Windows
and MIT clients fail against Heimdal KDC. Both Windows and MIT KDC
would allow any keyed checksum to be used so Heimdal client work
fine against it. Change Heimdal KDC to allow HMAC\_MD5 even for non
RC4 based TGT in order to support per-spec clients.
+ use memset\_s() instead of memset()
+ Detect Heimdal 1.0 through 7.6 clients that issue S4UProxy
(constrained delegation) TGS Requests with the request anonymous
flag set. These requests will be treated as S4UProxy requests and
not anonymous requests.
- HDB:
+ Set SQLite3 backend default page size to 8KB.
+ Add hdb\_set\_sync() method
- kadmind:
+ disable HDB sync during database load avoiding unnecessary disk i/o.
- ipropd:
+ disable HDB sync during receive\_everything. Doing an fsync
per-record when receiving the complete HDB is a performance
disaster. Among other things, if the HDB is very large, then one
slave receving a full HDB can cause
other slaves to timeout and, if HDB write activity is high enough to
cause iprop log truncation, then also need full syncs, which leads to a
cycle of full syncs for all slaves until HDB write activity drops.
Allowing the iprop log to be larger helps, but improving
receive\_everything() performance helps even more.
- kinit:
+ Anonymous PKINIT tickets discard the realm information used to
locate the issuing AS. Store the issuing realm in the credentials
cache in order to locate a KDC which can renew them.
+ Do not leak the result of krb5\_cc\_get\_config() when determining
anonymous PKINIT start realm.
- klist:
+ Show transited-policy-checked, ok-as-delegate and anonymous flags
when listing credentials.
- tests:
+ Regenerate certs so that they expire before the 2038 armageddon so
the test suite will pass on 32-bit
operating systems until the underlying issues can be resolved.
- documentation:
+ rename verify-password to verify-password-quality
+ hprop default mode is encrypt
+ kadmind "all" permission does not include "get-keys"
+ verify-password-quality might not be stateless
Version 7.6.0:
+ Security (#555):
- CVE-2018-16860 Heimdal KDC: Reject PA-S4U2Self with unkeyed checksum
When the Heimdal KDC checks the checksum that is placed on the
S4U2Self packet by the server to protect the requested principal against
modification, it does not confirm that the checksum algorithm that
protects the user name (principal) in the request is keyed. This allows a
man-in-the-middle attacker who can intercept the request to the KDC to
modify the packet by replacing the user name (principal) in the request
with any desired user name (principal) that exists in the KDC and replace
the checksum protecting that name with a CRC32 checksum (which requires no
prior knowledge to compute). This would allow a S4U2Self ticket requested
on behalf of user name (principal) user@EXAMPLE.COM to any service to be
changed to a S4U2Self ticket with a user name (principal) of
Administrator@EXAMPLE.COM. This ticket would then contain the PAC of the
modified user name (principal).
- CVE-2019-12098, client-only:
RFC8062 Section 7 requires verification of the PA-PKINIT-KX key
exchange when anonymous PKINIT is used. Failure to do so can permit an
active attacker to become a man-in-the-middle.
+ Bug fixes:
- Happy eyeballs: Don't wait for responses from known-unreachable KDCs.
- kdc:
+ check return copy\_Realm, copy\_PrincipalName, copy\_EncryptionKey
- kinit:
+ cleanup temporary ccaches
+ see man page for "kinit --anonymous" command line syntax change
- kdc:
+ Make anonymous AS-requests more RFC8062-compliant. Updated expired
test certificates
+ Features:
- kuser: support authenticated anonymous AS-REQs in kinit
- kdc: support for anonymous TGS-REQs
- kgetcred support for anonymous service tickets
- Support builds with OpenSSL 1.1.1

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1705877#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2019-05-03 06:11:06 UTC  ``` As per upstream advisory:  S4U2Self is an extension to Kerberos used in Active Directory to allow a service to request a kerberos ticket to itself from the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) for a non-Kerberos authenticated user (principal in Kerboros parlance). This is useful to allow internal code paths to be standardized around Kerberos.  S4U2Proxy (constrained-delegation) is an extension of this mechanism allowing this impersonation to a second service over the network. It allows a   privileged server that obtained a S4U2Self ticket to itself to then assert the identity of that principal to a second service and present itself as that principal to get services from the second service.  There is a flaw in Samba's AD DC in the Heimdal KDC. When the Heimdal KDC checks the checksum that is placed on the S4U2Self packet by the server to protect the requested principal against modification, it does not confirm that the checksum algorithm that protects the user name (principal) in the request is keyed.  This allows a man-in-the-middle attacker who can intercept the request to the KDC to modify the packet by replacing the user name (principal) in the request with any desired user name (principal) that exists in the KDC and replace the checksum protecting that name with a CRC32 checksum (which requires no prior knowledge to compute).  This would allow a S4U2Self ticket requested on behalf of user name (principal) user to any service to be changed to a S4U2Self ticket with a user name (principal) of Administrator. This ticket would then contain the PAC of the modified user name (principal).   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1705877#c1)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2019-05-03 06:11:11 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Isaac Boukris and Andrew Bartlett (Samba Team and Catalyst)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1705877#c2)  Huzaifa S.

There is no explanation in this ticket/issue or at any of the links in this ticket/issue. The official Red Hat statement (<https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-16860>) on this CVE is similarly vague and just says "RHEL 7 not affected".  Our security compliance team requires more information from us, ideally, than "RH says its Samba is not affected. No reason why." I told them that RHEL Samba links to MIT Kerberos not Heimdal and that *might* be the reasoning for it not being a bug in RHEL, but admitted I was just guessing...  Any further info would be very much appreciated.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1705877#c9)  Guenther Deschner    2019-06-17 17:41:13 UTC  ``` Jeff, we are not shipping a Heimdal KDC for or with Samba at all in any Red Hat product.   We do build Samba's AD DC components only in Fedora and even there in Fedora we use a MIT Kerberos KDC, not the Heimdal KDC which is coming along with the Samba tarballs. Thus a flaw in the S4U2SELF implementation in a Heimdal KDC does not affect us at all.   ``` |  |
