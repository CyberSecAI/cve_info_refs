  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2018-16427",
    "description": "Multiple out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities exist in the OpenSC library, which can be triggered by a maliciously crafted smart card. Successful exploitation could lead to denial of service (application crash) or potentially have unspecified other impacts.",

    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient bounds checking when handling responses from smart cards, which leads to out-of-bounds reads.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
     ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to a denial of service (application crash).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious smart card sending malformed responses to APDU commands."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted smart card to the targeted system.",
     "fixes": [
        "In `sc_asn1_read_tag` in `src/libopensc/asn1.c`, added a check to ensure that the length of an ASN.1 tag is not greater than remaining buffer size, which prevents out-of-bounds reads.",
        "In `asepcos_parse_sec_attr` in `src/libopensc/card-asepcos.c`, a conditional was corrected to ensure proper bounds checking during access mode encoding",
        "In `authentic_set_current_files` in `src/libopensc/card-authentic.c` a check was added to ensure that the combined length of the current DF and card's current DF path does not overflow the destination buffer. Also, in `authentic_process_fci` added bounds check to prevent potential OOB read in sec_attr processing.",
        "In `cac_read_binary` in `src/libopensc/card-cac.c`, a check was added to break loop if the value length is inconsistent with available data length, avoiding out-of-bounds reads.",
       "In `coolkey_find_attribute` in `src/libopensc/card-coolkey.c`, a check was added to ensure that there are at least 4 bytes available in record before processing",
        "In `entersafe_gen_key` in `src/libopensc/card-entersafe.c`, added checks to prevent invalid data from being processed that caused crashes. Assertions were replaced with proper error handling.",
        "In `decrypt_response` in `src/libopensc/card-epass2003.c`, a check was added to ensure that the `cipher_len` isn't larger than plaintext buffer and also corrected an unpadding related out of bounds read.",
       "In `gpk_parse_fileinfo` in `src/libopensc/card-gpk.c`, added check to make sure access control list data isn't beyond the end of buffer.",
        "In `iasecc_get_serialnr` in `src/libopensc/card-iasecc.c`, added bound check before read and copy to prevent OOB reads when serial number was being parsed.",
       "In `auth_select_file` and `auth_read_binary` in `src/libopensc/card-oberthur.c`, added check to ensure a valid EF is present to prevent dereferencing null pointers.",
        "In `pgp_enumerate_blob` in `src/libopensc/card-openpgp.c`, added a check to prevent out of bounds read when parsing ASN.1 tags.",
        "In `piv_general_io` in `src/libopensc/card-piv.c`, check was added to ensure that the buffer length matches what is available. Also in `piv_match_card_continued`, added checks to prevent OOB reads when examining ATR historical bytes.",
        "In `rtecp_select_file` in `src/libopensc/card-rtecp.c`, a check was added to prevent freeing an already freed `file` in an error path.",
        "In `parse_sec_attr_44` in `src/libopensc/card-setcos.c`, several checks were added to ensure there's enough data before processing access condition data.",
        "In `sc_parse_ef_gdo_content` in `src/libopensc/ef-gdo.c`, adjusted to correctly parse GDO content and use remaining buffer length rather than original.",
        "In `itacns_add_data_files` in `src/libopensc/pkcs15-itacns.c`, a code block was added to ensure a return if there is no available data, rather than continuing operation.",
        "In `insert_key` and `insert_pin` in `src/libopensc/pkcs15-tcos.c`, checks were added to ensure that property attributes have enough length before processing, prevents dereferencing a null pointer."
