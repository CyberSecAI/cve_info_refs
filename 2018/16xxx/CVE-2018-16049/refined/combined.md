# Credentials outputted as plain text in the sidekiq log file.

### Summary

Credentials outputted as plain text in the sidekiq log file.

### Steps to reproduce

As part of importing a project into Gitlab community edition (using the via https://option), I provided my credentials using the suggested format (https://:@gitlabinstance.xyz.com/repo). The import failed (for some reason) but the surprising part was when I visited the sidekiq logs I saw my credentials printed in plain text. It doesn't matter that these logs might not be accessible to all - I would rate this as a serious bug.

The software should mask the credentials or not print them in the logs. Error messages indicating incorrect credentials should suffice. I'm using Gitlab CE v10.8

# Credentails used for repository import are visible inside the Sidekiq logs (Background Jobs)

Credentials used for repository import are visible in plain text inside the Sidekiq log. They should be censored instead.
