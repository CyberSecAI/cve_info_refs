The provided content relates to CVE-2018-16049.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Credentials used during repository import are being outputted in plain text into the Sidekiq log file. This occurs when a user includes credentials in the import URL, specifically using the format `https://<username>:<password>@gitlabinstance.xyz.com/repo`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unmasked credentials in logs: The application fails to sanitize or mask credentials before writing them to the log files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exposure of sensitive information:  An attacker with access to the Sidekiq logs can gain access to the credentials used for repository import.
- Potential lateral movement: If the exposed credentials are used for other services or accounts, attackers can potentially gain further access.

**Attack vectors:**
- Log file access: An attacker must gain access to the server's Sidekiq log files to extract the credentials.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to Sidekiq logs: The attacker must have some level of access to the server where GitLab is running, specifically access to the sidekiq log files.
- Knowledge of log file locations: The attacker should also know the location of these log files.
