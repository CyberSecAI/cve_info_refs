  "vulnerability": {
    "cveID": "CVE-2018-16882",
    "description": "A use-after-free vulnerability existed in the KVM implementation of the Linux kernel, when handling interrupts in environments where nested virtualization is in use (nested KVM virtualization is not enabled by default in Ubuntu kernels). A local attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to gain administrative privileges in a host machine.",
    "affected_component": "KVM implementation of the Linux kernel",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a use-after-free error in how the KVM hypervisor processes posted interrupts when nested virtualization is enabled. Specifically, in the `nested_get_vmcs12_pages()` function, if there is an error while processing the posted interrupt address, the `pi_desc_page` is unmapped without resetting the `pi_desc` descriptor address. This address is then used later in the `pi_test_and_clear_on()` function, leading to a use-after-free.",
    "vulnerability_details": [
      "Use-after-free vulnerability"
     ],
    "impact": "A local attacker within a guest virtual machine could potentially gain administrative privileges on the host machine or cause a denial of service (system crash).",
    "attack_vector": "Local access within a guest virtual machine.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a local user within a guest VM and have the ability to trigger the vulnerable code path in the KVM implementation when nested virtualization is enabled."
