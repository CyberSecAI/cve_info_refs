## Details

Wen Xu discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the ext4

filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10876](/security/CVE-2018-10876), [CVE-2018-10879](/security/CVE-2018-10879))

Wen Xu discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the ext4 filesystem

implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to construct

a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-10877](/security/CVE-2018-10877))

Wen Xu discovered that an out-of-bounds write vulnerability existed in the

ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use

this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10878](/security/CVE-2018-10878), [CVE-2018-10882](/security/CVE-2018-10882))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly ensure that xattr information remained in inode

bodies. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-10880](/security/CVE-2018-10880))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel could possibly perform an out of bounds write when updating the

journal for an inline file. An attacker could use this to construct a

malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2018-10883](/security/CVE-2018-10883))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the vsock address family

implementation of the Linux kernel that could lead to a use-after-free

condition. A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to

expose sensitive information (host machine kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-14625](/security/CVE-2018-14625))

Cfir Cohen discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

KVM implementation of the Linux kernel, when handling interrupts in

environments where nested virtualization is in use (nested KVM

virtualization is not enabled by default in Ubuntu kernels). A local

attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to gain administrative

privileges in a host machine. ([CVE-2018-16882](/security/CVE-2018-16882))

Jann Horn discovered that the procfs file system implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly restrict the ability to inspect the kernel

stack of an arbitrary task. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-17972](/security/CVE-2018-17972))

Jann Horn discovered that the mremap() system call in the Linux kernel did

not properly flush the TLB when completing, potentially leaving access to a

physical page after it has been released to the page allocator. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash), expose

sensitive information, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-18281](/security/CVE-2018-18281))

Wei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not

properly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-19407](/security/CVE-2018-19407))

It was discovered that the debug interface for the Linux kernel's HID

subsystem did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. An

attacker with access to debugfs could use this to cause a denial of service

or possibly gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2018-9516](/security/CVE-2018-9516))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# USN-3878-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

4 February 2019

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel
* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-gcp](/security/cves?package=linux-gcp) - Linux kernel for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) systems
* [linux-kvm](/security/cves?package=linux-kvm) - Linux kernel for cloud environments
* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2

## Details

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the vsock address family

implementation of the Linux kernel that could lead to a use-after-free

condition. A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to

expose sensitive information (host machine kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-14625](/security/CVE-2018-14625))

Cfir Cohen discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

KVM implementation of the Linux kernel, when handling interrupts in

environments where nested virtualization is in use (nested KVM

virtualization is not enabled by default in Ubuntu kernels). A local

attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to gain administrative

privileges in a host machine. ([CVE-2018-16882](/security/CVE-2018-16882))

Wei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not

properly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-19407](/security/CVE-2018-19407))

It was discovered that the crypto subsystem of the Linux kernel leaked

uninitialized memory to user space in some situations. A local attacker

could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).

([CVE-2018-19854](/security/CVE-2018-19854))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-azure](/security/cves?package=linux-azure) - Linux kernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems

## Details

Wen Xu discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the ext4

filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10876](/security/CVE-2018-10876), [CVE-2018-10879](/security/CVE-2018-10879))

Wen Xu discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the ext4 filesystem

implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to construct

a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-10877](/security/CVE-2018-10877))

Wen Xu discovered that an out-of-bounds write vulnerability existed in the

ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use

this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10878](/security/CVE-2018-10878), [CVE-2018-10882](/security/CVE-2018-10882))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly ensure that xattr information remained in inode

bodies. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-10880](/security/CVE-2018-10880))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel could possibly perform an out of bounds write when updating the

journal for an inline file. An attacker could use this to construct a

malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2018-10883](/security/CVE-2018-10883))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the vsock address family

implementation of the Linux kernel that could lead to a use-after-free

condition. A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to

expose sensitive information (host machine kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-14625](/security/CVE-2018-14625))

Cfir Cohen discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

KVM implementation of the Linux kernel, when handling interrupts in

environments where nested virtualization is in use (nested KVM

virtualization is not enabled by default in Ubuntu kernels). A local

attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to gain administrative

privileges in a host machine. ([CVE-2018-16882](/security/CVE-2018-16882))

Jann Horn discovered that the procfs file system implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly restrict the ability to inspect the kernel

stack of an arbitrary task. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-17972](/security/CVE-2018-17972))

Jann Horn discovered that the mremap() system call in the Linux kernel did

not properly flush the TLB when completing, potentially leaving access to a

physical page after it has been released to the page allocator. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash), expose

sensitive information, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-18281](/security/CVE-2018-18281))

Wei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not

properly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-19407](/security/CVE-2018-19407))

It was discovered that the debug interface for the Linux kernel's HID

subsystem did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. An

attacker with access to debugfs could use this to cause a denial of service

or possibly gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2018-9516](/security/CVE-2018-9516))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-aws-hwe](/security/cves?package=linux-aws-hwe) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS-HWE) systems
* [linux-gcp](/security/cves?package=linux-gcp) - Linux kernel for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) systems
* [linux-hwe](/security/cves?package=linux-hwe) - Linux hardware enablement (HWE) kernel

## Details

USN-3871-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 18.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS for Ubuntu

16.04 LTS.

Wen Xu discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the ext4

filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10876](/security/CVE-2018-10876), [CVE-2018-10879](/security/CVE-2018-10879))

Wen Xu discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the ext4 filesystem

implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to construct

a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-10877](/security/CVE-2018-10877))

Wen Xu discovered that an out-of-bounds write vulnerability existed in the

ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use

this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10878](/security/CVE-2018-10878), [CVE-2018-10882](/security/CVE-2018-10882))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly ensure that xattr information remained in inode

bodies. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-10880](/security/CVE-2018-10880))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel could possibly perform an out of bounds write when updating the

journal for an inline file. An attacker could use this to construct a

malicious ext4 image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2018-10883](/security/CVE-2018-10883))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the vsock address family

implementation of the Linux kernel that could lead to a use-after-free

condition. A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to

expose sensitive information (host machine kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-14625](/security/CVE-2018-14625))

Cfir Cohen discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

KVM implementation of the Linux kernel, when handling interrupts in

environments where nested virtualization is in use (nested KVM

virtualization is not enabled by default in Ubuntu kernels). A local

attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to gain administrative

privileges in a host machine. ([CVE-2018-16882](/security/CVE-2018-16882))

Jann Horn discovered that the procfs file system implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly restrict the ability to inspect the kernel

stack of an arbitrary task. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-17972](/security/CVE-2018-17972))

Jann Horn discovered that the mremap() system call in the Linux kernel did

not properly flush the TLB when completing, potentially leaving access to a

physical page after it has been released to the page allocator. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash), expose

sensitive information, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-18281](/security/CVE-2018-18281))

Wei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not

properly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-19407](/security/CVE-2018-19407))

It was discovered that the debug interface for the Linux kernel's HID

subsystem did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. An

attacker with access to debugfs could use this to cause a denial of service

or possibly gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2018-9516](/security/CVE-2018-9516))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# USN-3872-1: Linux kernel (HWE) vulnerabilities

29 January 2019

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)

## Packages

* [linux-hwe](/security/cves?package=linux-hwe) - Linux hardware enablement (HWE) kernel

## Details

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the vsock address family

implementation of the Linux kernel that could lead to a use-after-free

condition. A local attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to

expose sensitive information (host machine kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-14625](/security/CVE-2018-14625))

Cfir Cohen discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

KVM implementation of the Linux kernel, when handling interrupts in

environments where nested virtualization is in use (nested KVM

virtualization is not enabled by default in Ubuntu kernels). A local

attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to gain administrative

privileges in a host machine. ([CVE-2018-16882](/security/CVE-2018-16882))

Wei Wu discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not

properly ensure that ioapics were initialized. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-19407](/security/CVE-2018-19407))

It was discovered that the crypto subsystem of the Linux kernel leaked

uninitialized memory to user space in some situations. A local attacker

could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).

([CVE-2018-19854](/security/CVE-2018-19854))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

  -
  [4.18.0.14.64](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-hwe/4.18.0.14.64)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
