Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information regarding CVE-2018-16839:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Integer overflow in the `Curl_auth_create_plain_message` function when calculating the buffer size for SASL authentication, specifically when handling user names longer than 2GB on 32-bit systems. This overflow results in a much smaller buffer being allocated than needed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of input lengths (username and password) when calculating the buffer size needed for SASL authentication. When these lengths are large, specifically the username, an integer overflow occurs, leading to an incorrect buffer size calculation.
*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The undersized buffer allocation due to the integer overflow causes a heap-based buffer overflow when the function attempts to write more data into the buffer than it can hold.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can trigger this vulnerability, leading to a crash of the application using libcurl, resulting in a denial of service.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated as a direct consequence in all sources, some documents suggest that this heap overflow could *possibly* be leveraged for arbitrary code execution under specific conditions.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning an attacker can trigger the overflow through network requests to a service using the vulnerable `libcurl` library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to initiate a connection that uses SASL authentication (PLAIN mechanism), and provide a specially crafted, very long username (more than 1GB) and a password.
*   No user interaction is required.
*   No special privileges are required.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `lib/vauth/cleartext.c` specifically in the `Curl_auth_create_plain_message` function.
*   The issue was introduced in `curl` version 7.33.0 and fixed in 7.62.0
*   The original fix was not perfect and was later improved.
*   While the vulnerability can theoretically be triggered on 64 bit systems, providing user/passwords with sizes that could trigger it is not realistically possible.
*   The vulnerability can be hard to trigger using standard `libcurl` APIs, because of memory allocation mechanisms preventing long user names to be handled in the first place.

**Summary of affected versions:**

*   `curl` versions 7.33.0 through 7.61.1

**Summary of fixed versions:**

*   `curl` >= 7.62.0
