Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2018-16543:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is related to the `gssetresolution` operator in Ghostscript. This operator is non-standard and not used anywhere. It leads to memory corruption when used. The provided bug report shows a crash with a segmentation fault, which indicates a memory corruption issue. The valgrind output further confirms an invalid write due to `memcpy`.
*   The core issue is related to incorrect memory allocation or handling during device initialization in the `gssetresolution` implementation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory corruption:** The primary weakness is memory corruption, specifically an invalid write, which is identified through Valgrind.
*   **Type confusion:** The error message "/typecheck in --.putdeviceprops--" suggests a type confusion issue during handling of device properties.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can lead to a segmentation fault and crash of the Ghostscript interpreter, effectively causing a denial of service.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potential):** While the provided information doesn't explicitly confirm arbitrary code execution, memory corruption vulnerabilities can often be leveraged for code execution if exploited correctly, especially in combination with other vulnerabilities.  The Debian Security Advisory mentions "execution of arbitrary code" as a possible outcome.
*   **Other unspecified impacts:** As noted in the Gentoo advisory, there is potential for other unspecified impacts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malformed PostScript File:** The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted PostScript file that utilizes the vulnerable `gssetresolution` operator.
*   **User/Automated System Interaction:** An attacker needs to trick a user or an automated system into processing the malicious PostScript file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a PostScript file to include the malicious commands.
*   The attacker does not need to be present on the system, but a user or process on the system has to process the malicious file through ghostscript for the vulnerability to be triggered.

**Additional Notes**

*   The `gssetresolution` operator is non-standard and not used, and was removed in a later commit, resolving this and similar issues.
*   The vulnerability is triggered despite the dSAFER sandbox being enabled, which implies it bypasses that protection mechanism.
*   The bug report mentions the issue being fixed by commits `f52734ba87` and `c9b362ba908c`, and the removal of the operator by commit `5b5536fa88a9`.
