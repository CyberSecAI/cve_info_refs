- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists because the `username` command-line parameter in `contrib/next-login/login.c` is passed to `strcpy()` without sanitization, leading to a buffer overflow if the input is too long.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow due to unchecked input length.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Potential to overwrite stack data, leading to possible control-flow hijacking. However, the advisory indicates a low severity rating, implying limited impact, such as denial of service or minor information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a long string as a command-line parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to execute the vulnerable binary with a specially crafted command-line argument. The advisory states that no user privileges are needed and no user interaction is required.
