{
  "CVE-2018-16138": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Lack of input sanitization in the IPBrickOS administrative interface.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Both persistent and reflective XSS attacks are possible.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject JavaScript code, potentially stealing authentication tokens, and compromising clients through browser exploits. This can lead to full control of the system.",
    "Attack vectors": "By injecting malicious Javascript into vulnerable input fields.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to submit malicious input into the vulnerable fields. This could be done by an administrator directly, or through other means. In the case of persistent XSS, an attacker would only need to entice a victim to view a page displaying the injected malicious code."
