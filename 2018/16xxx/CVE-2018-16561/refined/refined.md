- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected CPUs improperly validate S7 communication packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack can cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition, forcing the CPU to enter DEFECT mode, which requires a manual restart to recover. This compromises the availability of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted S7 communication packet to any communication interface of the CPU, including Ethernet, PROFIBUS, and Multi Point Interfaces (MPI).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious S7 communication packet to a communication interface of the vulnerable CPU. No user interaction or special privileges are required for the exploitation.
