The provided content details a vulnerability in the Passive Keyless Entry and Start (PKES) system of the Tesla Model S, which uses the outdated DST40 cipher.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of the outdated and weak proprietary DST40 cipher for cryptographic operations within the PKES system. This cipher has a small 40-bit key space and a 24-bit response output, which is vulnerable to Time-Memory Trade-Off (TMTO) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Outdated Cipher:** The use of the DST40 cipher, which was reverse-engineered and broken in 2005, is a significant weakness.
*   **Small Key Space:** The 40-bit key space of DST40 is too small and can be exhaustively searched given enough resources.
*   **Non-Mutual Authentication:** The challenge-response protocol lacks mutual authentication, meaning the car does not authenticate the key fob before the key responds, and the key fob doesn't verify the car's legitimacy. This allows anyone who knows the car's identifier to solicit responses from a key fob.
*  **Vulnerable to TMTO attacks:** Because of the small keyspace and non-mutual authentication, precomputed TMTO tables can be created, drastically reducing the time to recover a key from the challenge-response pairs.
*   **Challenge Response Protocol:** The challenge-response protocol is vulnerable because it is not resistant to replay attacks. 

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to clone the key fob in a few seconds and gain unauthorized access to the vehicle. This includes:
*   Unlocking the doors.
*   Starting the car.
*   Potentially stealing the vehicle.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Radio Frequency (RF) Communication:** The attack exploits the LF (134.2 kHz) and UHF (433.92 MHz) bands used for communication between the car and the key fob.
*  **Challenge-Response Interception:** The attacker intercepts the car's identifier and sends their own challenges to the key fob to obtain corresponding responses.
*   **TMTO Attack:** An attacker leverages precomputed TMTO tables to quickly recover the key used by the key fob.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Proximity to Key Fob:** The attacker needs to be within RF communication range (up to 1 meter, potentially more with better antennas) of the key fob.
*   **Equipment:** The attacker requires relatively cheap hardware such as a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, Proxmark3, Yard Stick One, and a USB battery pack. Additionally, a large hard drive is needed to store the precomputed TMTO tables.
*   **Technical Knowledge:**  Knowledge of the challenge-response protocol, RF communication, and how to use the TMTO attack for key recovery.
