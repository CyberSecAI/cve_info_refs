{
  "CVE-2018-16395": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The equality check of `OpenSSL::X509::Name` is not correct if the value of an entity of the argument (right-hand side) starts with the value of the receiver (left-hand side).",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Incorrect equality check in `OpenSSL::X509::Name` comparison.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious X.509 certificate could be incorrectly judged as equal to an existing certificate.",
    "Attack vectors": "Passing a malicious X.509 certificate for comparison.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to pass a crafted X.509 certificate and compare it to an existing one."
  },
  "CVE-2018-16396": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Tainted flags are not propagated in Array#pack and String#unpack with some directives (B, b, H, and h).",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Tainted flags are not properly propagated during `Array#pack` and `String#unpack` operations with certain directives.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "If a script uses `Array#pack` and/or `String#unpack` with the specified directives to process unreliable inputs and uses tainted flags to check reliability, the check might be wrong.",
      "Attack vectors": "Processing unreliable inputs using `Array#pack` and `String#unpack` with B, b, H, or h directives.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to control the input processed by the vulnerable `Array#pack` and `String#unpack` methods."
