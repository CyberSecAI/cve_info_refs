The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the search functionality of EasyCMS.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the search functionality. While the application attempts to filter XSS attacks using a custom `removeXSS` function, it is incomplete and can be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate XSS filtering: The `removeXSS` function uses a blacklist approach, attempting to remove known XSS vectors. However, it doesn't cover all possible attack vectors, making it susceptible to bypasses.
- Bypassing the `removeXSS` function:  The provided proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrates how an attacker can inject an XSS payload using the `onhashchange` event, which isn't properly filtered by the custom function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the search results page, which will be executed in the victim's browser.
- Potential for account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions: The execution of arbitrary JavaScript can enable various attacks, depending on the attacker's goals. This may include stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or other harmful activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious search query: An attacker crafts a specific search query containing the XSS payload.
- Vulnerable search functionality: The search functionality fails to properly sanitize the user's input before rendering the results on the webpage.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Knowledge of XSS vulnerabilities: The attacker needs to be aware of how to craft XSS payloads that bypass the implemented filters.
- Ability to submit a search query: The attacker can send the malicious search query through the application's search feature.

The provided information gives more detail than the basic CVE description by providing:
- The vulnerable code location (`App/Modules/Index/Action/SearchAction.class.php` and `App/Common/common.php`)
- The flawed sanitization function `removeXSS`
- A specific proof of concept payload to demonstrate the vulnerability `"<body onhashchange=alert(1)><a href=#>xss"`
- An example HTTP request showing how to exploit it.
