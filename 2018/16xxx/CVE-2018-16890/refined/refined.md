  "CVE_data": {
    "CVE_ID": "CVE-2018-16890",
    "Description": "libcurl versions from 7.36.0 to before 7.64.0 is vulnerable to a heap buffer out-of-bounds read. The function handling incoming NTLM type-2 messages (`lib/vauth/ntlm.c:ntlm_decode_type2_target`) does not validate incoming data correctly and is subject to an integer overflow vulnerability. Using that overflow, a malicious or broken NTLM server could trick libcurl to accept a bad length + offset combination that would lead to a buffer read out-of-bounds.",
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow in the NTLM type-2 message handling, leading to an out-of-bounds read.",
    "Vulnerability": "Heap out-of-bounds read",
    "Impact": "A malicious or broken NTLM server could cause a denial of service (crash) by triggering an out-of-bounds read in libcurl's handling of NTLM type-2 messages.",
    "Attack vector": "A malicious or compromised NTLM server can send a crafted NTLM type-2 response to trigger the vulnerability when a libcurl client connects to it.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to control an NTLM server which the vulnerable client connects to"
