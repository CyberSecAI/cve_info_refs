Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-16797:

**1. Verification:**
   - The provided blog post from `nightohl.tistory.com` explicitly mentions **CVE-2018-16797** and describes a vulnerability in PotPlayer related to audio (.wav) file processing, which aligns with the CVE description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in PotPlayer and PotPlayerMini when processing specially crafted .wav audio files.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The vulnerability occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when allocating and copying data to heap buffers while processing a .wav audio file.
   - **Uncontrolled size of heap buffers:** The vulnerability is caused due to controllable parameters in the .wav header file, allowing an attacker to set specific sizes for heap buffers.
   - **Vulnerable function pointer:** A function pointer within the `ffcodec` module (specifically used for audio decoding) is located on the heap, making it a target for exploitation by overwriting it to control EIP (Extended Instruction Pointer).

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
    - **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on a victim's machine by exploiting this vulnerability. By overwriting a function pointer, an attacker gains control of the EIP and can redirect the program flow to execute malicious code.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
    - **Maliciously crafted .wav file:** The attack vector is a specifically crafted .wav audio file.
    - **User interaction:** The user must open the malicious .wav file in a vulnerable version of PotPlayer to trigger the vulnerability.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Ability to craft .wav file:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious .wav file with specific header values that will trigger the overflow.
   - **Social engineering or file sharing:** The attacker must trick the user into opening the malicious .wav file using PotPlayer.

**Technical Details:**
    - The attacker manipulates the following .wav header fields to trigger the vulnerability:
        -   **BytesPerSec:** Set to a large value to create large heap buffer.
        -   **SamplesPerSec:** Used to control the size of the Source heap.
        -   **data chunk size:** Used to control the size of the destination heap.
   - The exploit utilizes a function pointer within the `ffcodec` module, which is located on the heap and is vulnerable to being overwritten to control EIP.
   - The blog post identifies the function pointer via function table info in `PotPlayer.dll` where the “call eax” command is called.
   - The destination heap is placed at LFH chunk size `0x2a8` which is requested as `0x2a0`. LFH (Low Fragmentation Heap) is used for the heap allocation.
    -  The post identifies specific values for the header fields to trigger the buffer overflow:
         - `SamplesPerSec` to `0xFFFF8015` to set the Dst heap size to `0x2a0`
         -  Shellcode is placed in the source heap and a DLL that is not ASLR is identified (`DaumCrashHandler.dll`) and a static call address (`call edi`) is used to redirect to the shellcode.

**Additional Notes:**
- The blog post provides detailed technical information with screenshots of a debugger showing the memory layout and registers during exploitation.
-  The vulnerability was tested on Windows 7 (32-bit) using PotPlayer 1.7.8556 (32bit)
- The blog post describes specific modulations (manipulations) of the .wav data section that were needed to bypass checks and to allow for the source heap to be copied to the destination heap.
- The post includes an example shellcode for launching "Calc.exe"

**Summary of extracted vulnerability information:**
- **Vulnerability:** Heap-based buffer overflow in PotPlayer when processing .wav files.
- **Root Cause:** Manipulable header fields allow attacker to control size of heap buffers, leading to overwriting a function pointer.
- **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE).
- **Attack vector:**  Specially crafted .wav audio file.
- **Attacker position:** Needs ability to craft the file and convince victim to open it.
- **Technical Details:** specific header manipulations, LFH heap overwrite, shellcode execution.
