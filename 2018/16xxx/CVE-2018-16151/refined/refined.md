Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-16151:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `gmp` plugin of strongSwan, specifically within the ASN.1 parsing code used for verifying RSA signatures. The OID parser in the ASN.1 code allows an arbitrary number of random bytes after a valid OID. This is due to the lenient parsing in the `asn1_known_oid()` function which ignores any data after a valid OID.  This doesn't enforce strict parsing of the OID.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation within the ASN.1 OID parser. The code doesn't enforce strict parsing of the OID, allowing additional, non-standard data to be included.
*   **Lenient ASN.1 Parsing:** The general design of the ASN.1 parsing code to accept a variety of keys and certificates made it too lenient, leading to vulnerabilities

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Authorization Bypass:** An attacker can forge signatures by crafting malicious certificates or authentication messages which exploit the parsing flaws. This allows them to bypass the authentication process, potentially impersonating a user or creating arbitrary certificates if a Certificate Authority's (CA) key is vulnerable.
*   **Impersonation:** If a low-exponent key is used by a peer in an IPsec connection, the attacker may be able to impersonate that peer if their certificate or raw public key is vulnerable.
*   **Forged Signatures:** Attackers can generate forged signatures, particularly if low-exponent RSA keys (e=3) are in use. These signatures can be accepted by any key of the same length and low exponent.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be launched remotely by sending specially crafted certificates or IKE authentication messages.
*   **IKE Authentication:**  Attackers can exploit the vulnerability during IKE authentication, potentially gaining unauthorized access to a VPN.
*   **Certificate Forgery:** Attackers may create arbitrary certificates if the CA certificate uses a low-exponent key.
*   **Network Communication:** By intercepting or initiating network communications, an attacker can send these crafted payloads.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network access:**  The attacker needs to be able to send IKE messages to the target system, likely requiring a position on the network that can communicate with the target.
*   **Knowledge of key length:** The attacker does not need to know the actual public key value, just the key length, which could be guessed.
*   **Low Exponent Keys:**  The vulnerability is exploitable when low-exponent RSA keys (e.g., e=3) are used in certificates or for IKE authentication.
*   **gmp plugin enabled:** The `gmp` plugin must be enabled and loaded on the target strongSwan installation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specifically linked to the *gmp* plugin. Installations without this plugin are not affected
*   The issue is more easily exploited if the implementation accepts signatures without padding, although the padding issue is not a vulnerability in itself.
*   Remote code execution is not possible with these specific issues.
*   Patches have been released for strongSwan 5.7.0 and later versions. Patches are also available for older releases.
*   The vulnerability is a variant of Bleichenbacher's low-exponent attack on PKCS#1 RSA signatures.
