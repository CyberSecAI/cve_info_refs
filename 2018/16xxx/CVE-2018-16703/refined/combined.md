## Description

[![@natstheway](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17046313?v=4&size=48)](/natstheway)[natstheway](https://github.com/natstheway)opened [on Sep 7, 2018](https://github.com/gleez/cms/issues/802#issue-358051236)

Description :

A vulnerability in the Gleez CMS login page could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform multiple user enumeration, which can further help attacker to perform login attempts in excess of the configured login attempt limit. The vulnerability is due to insufficient server-side access control and login attempt limit enforcement. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending modified login attempts to the Portal login page. An exploit could allow the attacker to identify existing users and perform brute-force password attacks on the Portal.

Proof of concept :

Any unauthenticated user can perform user enumeration by changing id in the below URL.

<https://demo.gleezcms.org/user/4>

This can help user to identify the user names registered on the CMS portal.

Since there is account lockout implement, the brute force attempt can be successfully executed.

Also, there is no password complexity or strength defined while creating account, which means passwords of significantly smaller length could be set, which makes it easy for the attacker.

Version : Gleez CMS v1.3.0

Impact :

This can lead to confidentiality impact and potential account compromise.
