{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Insufficient server-side access control and login attempt limit enforcement.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unauthenticated user enumeration vulnerability through predictable user ID URLs (e.g., /user/4).",
      "Lack of sufficient login attempt limits allowing for brute-force attacks.",
      "Absence of password complexity requirements."
    ],
    "impact": "Confidentiality impact due to user enumeration, and potential account compromise via brute-force password attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Directly accessing predictable user ID URLs to identify valid user accounts.",
      "Sending modified login attempts to bypass login attempt limits and conduct brute force attacks.",
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They require the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server."
