Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-16156:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Fujitsu PaperStream IP (TWAIN) software (version 1.42.0.5685) service, `FJTWSVIC.exe`, attempts to load the `UninOldIS.dll` library dynamically, and execute the exported `ChangeUninstallString` function. This DLL is not included in the default installation, creating an opportunity for DLL hijacking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **DLL Hijacking:** The service attempts to load `UninOldIS.dll` without specifying a full path. This allows an attacker to place a malicious DLL with the same name in a directory listed in the system's PATH environment variable.
- **Unauthenticated Named Pipe Communication:** The service processes unauthenticated messages received over the `FjtwMkic_Fjicube_32` named pipe. This means that any user can send messages to the service, triggering the vulnerable DLL loading behavior.
- **Privileged Execution:** The vulnerable service `FJTWSVIC.exe` runs with SYSTEM privileges, enabling the attacker to escalate their privileges to SYSTEM level upon successful DLL hijacking.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges. An attacker can achieve full control of the affected system by loading a malicious DLL.

**Attack vectors:**
- A local attacker can place a malicious DLL named `UninOldIS.dll` in a directory that is part of the system's PATH.
- The attacker can send an arbitrary message to the vulnerable named pipe which will trigger the attempt to load the malicious DLL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the vulnerable system.
- The attacker needs to be able to write files to a directory within the system's PATH variable.
- The attacker needs to be able to send messages to the named pipe `FjtwMkic_Fjicube_32`.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Fujitsu PaperStream IP (TWAIN) version 1.42.0.5685 (Service Update 7) or earlier.
- The vendor has released a patch in version 1.60 to remedy the vulnerability.
- Securifera assigned the CVE number and also created a public advisory for this vulnerability.
