### gmarkup: Fix crash in error handling path for closing elements

```

If something which looks like a closing tag is left unfinished, but
isn’t paired to an opening tag in the document, the error handling code
would do a null pointer dereference. Avoid that, at the cost of
introducing a new translatable error message.

Includes a test case, courtesy of pdknsk.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

# Null pointer dereference in g\_markup\_parse\_context\_end\_parse()

## Submitted by Jin `@JsHuang`

**[Link to original bug (#795147)](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=795147)**

## Description

Created attachment 370763
simple test case to reproduce the bug

Function g\_markup\_parse\_context\_end\_parse() dosen't call current\_element() function carefully. and can cause null pointer dereference error while parsing an malformed input.

The definition of function current\_element() is as below:

static inline const gchar\*
current\_element (GMarkupParseContext \*context)
{
return context->tag\_stack->data; // context->tag\_stack may be NULL;
}

This bug resides in gmarkup.c ,near line 1837, in case "STATE\_AFTER\_CLOSE\_TAG\_NAME":

1834 case STATE\_AFTER\_CLOSE\_TAG\_NAME:
1835 set\_error (context, error, G\_MARKUP\_ERROR\_PARSE,
1836 \_("Document ended unexpectedly inside the close tag for "
1837 "element '%s'"), current\_element (context));
1838 break;

here set\_error is called and use the return value of "current\_element (context)" as it's parameter, without checking whether "context->tag\_stack" is NULL or not. Parsing invalid data may lead to null pointer dereference.

I think this bug may exits in other place where current\_element() is not carefully called, a good way to fix it is to add an assertion in current\_element().

The attachment is a simple test case to reproduce it.

The CVE IDs for the individual vulnerable components are enough to
describe the vulnerability. You don't need new CVE IDs to describe the
fact that the installer installs vulnerable components.

Linux distribution packages are like installers, if you think about
it - and when a security vulnerability like CVE-2018-16428 is reported
in an upstream project like GLib, the same CVE ID is used to represent
the vulnerability in unfixed versions of the upstream project, unfixed
Debian packages, unfixed Fedora packages and so on. We say something like
"Debian 9's glib2.0 package is vulnerable to CVE-2018-16428". Otherwise
we'd need many more CVE IDs than we do now.

Package        : glib2.0
Version        : 2.42.1-1+deb8u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-16428 CVE-2018-16429 CVE-2019-13012
Debian Bug     : 931234

Various minor issues have been addressed in the GLib library. GLib is a
useful general-purpose C library used by projects such as GTK+, GIMP,
and GNOME.

CVE-2018-16428

    In GNOME GLib, g_markup_parse_context_end_parse() in gmarkup.c
    had a NULL pointer dereference.

CVE-2018-16429

    GNOME GLib had an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in
    g_markup_parse_context_parse() in gmarkup.c, related to utf8_str().

CVE-2019-13012

    The keyfile settings backend in GNOME GLib (aka glib2.0) before
    created directories using g_file_make_directory_with_parents
    (kfsb->dir, NULL, NULL) and files using g_file_replace_contents
    (kfsb->file, contents, length, NULL, FALSE,
    G_FILE_CREATE_REPLACE_DESTINATION, NULL, NULL, NULL). Consequently,
    it did not properly restrict directory (and file) permissions.
    Instead, for directories, 0777 permissions were used; for files,
    default file permissions were used. This issue is similar to
    CVE-2019-12450.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
2.42.1-1+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your glib2.0 packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
