{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `AjaxControl` component does not validate the page name for characters unsupported by the web server, specifically the DELETE character `0x7f`, which is not supported by IIS 7.5+ in the URL path.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Lack of protection against CSRF attacks (CVE-2018-16952)"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service.  Pages become inaccessible due to the inclusion of forbidden characters in their names. When a landing page is affected, it can cause sustained outages for non-technical users as they are unable to access the portal after login.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can rename a page to include unsupported characters, like the DELETE character (0x7f).",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Authenticated users with page renaming privileges can directly trigger the vulnerability.  Unauthenticated attackers can exploit the lack of CSRF protection to rename pages and communities if they can trick an authorized user into submitting a request."
