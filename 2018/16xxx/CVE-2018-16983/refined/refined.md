Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2018-16983:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability was caused by a workaround implemented in the NoScript extension to prevent it from blocking the Tor Browser's in-browser JSON viewer. This workaround inadvertently created a bypass in NoScript's script-blocking functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **NoScript Bypass:** The core vulnerability lies in the ability to bypass NoScript's primary function, which is to prevent the execution of scripts from untrusted domains.
- **Incorrect Workaround:** The specific workaround for the JSON viewer introduced a flaw in NoScript's security mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** By exploiting this flaw, malicious websites or hidden services could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the Tor Browser, even when the user had set the security level to "Safest".
- **Compromised Security:** This made the "Safest" security level within Tor Browser ineffective against script-based exploits.
- **Chaining with other exploits:** While the exploit itself doesn't reveal data it can be chained with other exploits for more damage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Websites:** An attacker could host a malicious website or hidden service that leverages this vulnerability.
- **Compromised Websites:** An attacker could compromise a legitimate website and inject malicious code to target Tor Browser users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Website Control:** The attacker needs to be able to control the content served by a website visited by the Tor Browser user, to host or inject malicious javascript code.
- **Exploit Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of the specific bypass in NoScript and how to use it in an exploit.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in Tor Browser 7.x series.
- Tor Browser 8.x was not vulnerable because it uses a new add-ons API.
- The NoScript add-on author was not aware of the vulnerability until ZDNet contacted him.
- A fix was released quickly by the NoScript author.
- A second exploit would be needed for real damage to be done against Tor Browser users.
