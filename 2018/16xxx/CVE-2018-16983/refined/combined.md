# Exploit vendor drops Tor Browser zero-day on Twitter

A company that sells exploits to government agencies drops Tor Browser zero-day on Twitter after recent Tor Browser update renders exploit less valuable.

Zerodium, a company that buys and sells vulnerabilities in popular software, has published details today on Twitter about a zero-day vulnerability in the Tor Browser, a Firefox-based browser used by privacy-conscious users for navigating the web through the anonymity provided by the Tor network.

[In a tweet](https://twitter.com/Zerodium/status/1039127214602641409?s=19), Zerodium said the vulnerability is a full bypass of the "Safest" security level of the NoScript extension that's included by default with all Tor Browser distributions.

[NoScript](https://noscript.net/) is a browser extension that uses a whitelist approach to let the user decide from what domains the browser can execute JavaScript, Flash, Java, or Silverlight content. It is included with all Tor Browser distributions because it provides an extra layer of security for Tor Browser users.

 ![zerodium-tor-zero-day.png]()

Zerodium's Tor zero-day basically allows malicious code to run inside the Tor Browser by bypassing NoScript's script-blocking ability.

According to Zerodium, the zero-day affects only the Tor Browser 7.x series. The Tor Browser 8.x branch, [released last week](https://www.zdnet.com/article/tor-browser-gets-a-redesign-switches-to-new-firefox-quantum-engine/), is not affected.

The reason is that the Tor Browser 8.x series switched its underlying codebase from an older Firefox core to the new Firefox Quantum platform, which uses a new add-ons API.

The NoScript add-on was rewritten at the end of last year to work on the new Firefox Quantum platform, hence the reason why the zero-day revealed today does not work on the new Tor Browser 8.x series.

In an interview with *ZDNet*, Giorgio Maone, the author of the NoScript extension, said the zero-day was caused by a workaround for NoScript blocking the Tor Browser's in-browser JSON viewer.

Maone was not aware of the vulnerability before *ZDNet* contacted him earlier today.

After successfully reproducing the issue, Maone promised an update to the NoScript add-on for later today, to mitigate the zero-day's effects.

"I'm gonna release the update within 24 hours or less, like I always did in the past," Maone told *ZDNet*.

The Tor Project replied to *ZDNet*'s request for comment but was not prepared to issue an official statement before this article's publication.

In an email exchange with *ZDNet*, Zerodium CEO Chaouki Bekrar provided more details about today's zero-day.

**Also: [Why free VPNs are not a risk worth taking](https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-free-vpns-are-not-a-risk-worth-taking/)**

"We've launched back in December 2017 a specific and time-limited [bug bounty for Tor Browser](https://zerodium.com/tor.html) and we've received and acquired, during and after the bounty, many Tor exploits meeting our requirements," Bekrar told *ZDNet*.

"This Tor Browser exploit was acquired by Zerodium many months ago as a zero-day and was shared with our government customers.

"We have decided to disclose this exploit as it has reached its end-of-life and it's not affecting Tor Browser version 8 which was released last week. We also wanted to raise awareness about the lack (or insufficient) security auditing of major components bundled by default with Tor Browser and trusted by millions of users.

**Also: [Best Home Security Devices for 2018](https://www.cnet.com/topics/smart-home/best-smart-home-devices/best-home-security-devices/) CNET**

"The exploit by itself does not reveal any data as it must be chained to other exploits, but it circumvents one of the most important security measures of Tor Browser which is provided by NoScript component.

"If a user sets his Tor browser security level to "Safest" aiming to block all JavaScript from all websites e.g. to prevent exploits, the disclosed bug would allow a website or a hidden service to bypass all NoScript restrictions and execute any JavaScript code, making the 'Safest' security level useless against browser exploits," Bekrar added.

ZDNet advises Tor Browser 7.x users to update to Tor Browser 8.x, or at least make sure to install the NoScript update that Maone promised for later today. The current NoScript version included with Tor Browser 7.5.6 is NoScript 5.1.8.6.

**UPDATE:** Minutes after this article's publication, Maone released [NoScript "Classic" version 5.1.8.7](https://noscript.net/getit#classic), which fixes the zero-day's exploitation vector. The patch came exactly two hours after Zerodium released details on Twitter. Maone also told *ZDNet* that the bug was introduced in NoScript 5.0.4, released on May the 11th 2017.

**UPDATE on September 11, 10:30 AM EST:** A spokesperson for the Tor Project told ZDNet they were not aware of the exploit prior to being disclosed on Twitter by Zerodium.The Tor Project member confirmed what Zerodium CEO Chaouki Bekrar told *ZDNet* --that a second exploit would be needed for doing real damage against Tor Browser users

"It is a bug in NoScript and not a zero-day exploit of Tor Browser that circumvents its privacy protections," the Tor Project spokesperson said. "For bypassing Tor, a real browser exploit would still be needed."

### **Development build**

NoScript development happens very fast to keep up with emerging web threats.
If you're brave enough and you need a specific feature or fix not released yet, or you simply want to provide feedback before official release, you may want to try the latest release candidate.

#### RC for Firefox

[**Install NoScript 12.1.0.901 on Firefox Desktop by simply clicking here**](https://secure.informaction.com/download/betas/noscript-12.1.0.901.xpi).

On Firefox for Android, unfortunately, a pre-release can only be downloaded (same link as above) and temporarily installed on Nightly by using the [web-ext tool](https://github.com/mozilla/web-ext), which is only suitable for hardcore developers and contributors.

#### Non-store versions for Chromium

On Chromium based browsers you can download either:

* [**NoScript 12.1.0.901 (MV3)**](https://secure.informaction.com/download/betas/noscript-12.1.0.901-chrome.zip) - experimental, supporting the Google-mandated but limiting, unproven and unstable latest extensions technology. **Requires Chromium version 128 or above** (latest stable version recommended).
* [**NoScript 11.4.44 (MV2)**](https://secure.informaction.com/download/releases/noscript-11.4.44-chrome.zip) - legacy, unsupported by Google but proven and stable. Best option for browsers based on Chromium 127 and below.

In order to install next MV3 version until it reaches the Chrome Store, or the MV2 version if you're affected by some MV3-caused bug which could not have been fixed yet, you need to unzip the downloaded `noscript-$VERSION-chrome.zip` file and load its content as an [unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#unpacked) in developer mode.

Please follow these steps:

1. Open the Extension Management page by navigating to chrome://extensions.
   Alternatively, open this page by clicking on the Extensions menu button and selecting Manage Extensions at the bottom of the menu.
   Alternatively, open this page by clicking on the Chrome menu, hovering over More Tools then selecting Extensions
2. Enable *Developer Mode* by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.
3. Unzip the zipped "noscript-12.1.0.901-chrome.zip" package to a directory of your choice.
4. Click the [Load unpacked] button and select the extension directory you've unzipped the extension to (the one containing the "manifest.json" file)

You're done. Happy testing!

### Browser compatibility and obsolete versions

[NoScript 12.1.1](#latest-stable) is compatible with browsers based on Gecko versions 115 and above (e.g. Firefox and Tor Browser, on desktop and Android) and on Chromium versions 128 and above (Chrome, Edge, Vivaldi, Brave...)

[NoScript 11.4.44rc2](https://secure.informaction.com/download/betas/noscript-11.4.44rc2.xpi) is compatible with Gecko versions 59-114.

[![NoScript Classic Logo](https://classic.noscript.net/noscript/logo.png)](https://classic.noscript.net/)

You can still download [**NoScript "Classic"** (5.1.9)](https://secure.informaction.com/download/releases/noscript-5.1.9.xpi) ([SHA256](https://secure.informaction.com/download/releases/noscript-5.1.9.xpi.sha256)) for Seamonkey, Palemoon, Waterfox Classic and possibly other "vintage" (pre-Gecko 57) Firefox forks [here](https://secure.informaction.com/download/releases/noscript-5.1.9.xpi).

**Notice:** *you may need to open about:config and set your **xpinstall.signatures.required** preference to **false** in order to install NoScript 5.x, since Mozilla doesn't support signatures for legacy add-ons anymore. If you're [using a non ESR Firefox, you may also need this hack](https://forums.informaction.com/viewtopic.php?p=98662#p98662).*

Users of Firefox 58 and below are urged to upgrade their very unsafe browser. For those few who can't,

* [latest NoScript version compatible with Gecko 57 - Gecko 58 is 10.1.7.3](https://secure.informaction.com/download/releases/noscript-10.1.7.3.xpi);
* [latest NoScript version compatible with Gecko 46 - Gecko 56 is 5.1.9](https://secure.informaction.com/download/releases/noscript-5.1.9.xpi) ([SHA256](https://secure.informaction.com/download/releases/noscript-5.1.9.xpi.sha256));
* [latest NoScript version compatible with Gecko 13 - Gecko 45 is 2.9.0.14](https://secure.informaction.com/download/releases/noscript-2.9.0.14.xpi) ([SHA256](https://secure.informaction.com/download/releases/noscript-2.9.0.14.xpi.sha256));
* [latest NoScript version compatible with Gecko 1.9 - Gecko 12 is 2.9.0.1rc1](https://secure.informaction.com/download/betas/noscript-2.9.0.1rc1.xpi) ([SHA256](https://secure.informaction.com/download/betas/noscript-2.9.0.1rc1.xpi.sha256));
* [latest NoScript version compatible with Gecko < 1.9 is 1.10](https://secure.informaction.com/download/releases/noscript-1.10.xpi) ([SHA256](https://secure.informaction.com/download/releases/noscript-1.10.xpi.sha256)).

#### Disclaimer

We cannot update nor support NoScript 5.x and below anymore, because it was based on a completely different and now obsolete technology. However you can still find usage information and a FAQ section for those ancient versions in the [NoScript Classic archived website](https://classic.noscript.net/).
