    "Insufficient input validation",
    "Code injection vulnerability",
    "Use of blacklist instead of whitelist"

  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution (RCE) on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Adding a malicious playback source via the admin panel",
    "Modifying the `v_playfrom` parameter in a video data request",

  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "Access to the admin panel of the Seacms application",
