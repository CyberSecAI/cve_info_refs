## Description

[![@samohyes](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27491168?u=03197aef9073960341fcaa32c9299b2489105011&v=4&size=48)](/samohyes)[samohyes](https://github.com/samohyes)opened [on Sep 13, 2018](https://github.com/BYVoid/OpenCC/issues/303#issue-359699539)

Hi, I am a security fan. And I found an out of bound pointer in BinaryDict.cpp which could lead to segment fault (Denial of Service if some applications use this library). In BinaryDict::NewFromFile, there are two offset which are keyOffset and valueOffset. So if I provide a .ocd file that I can control these two offsets, I can actually make it really big. So the pointers(const char\* key and const char\* value) will point to unreadable place. I've attached the POCs for these two pointers. Hope you can respond soon :)
