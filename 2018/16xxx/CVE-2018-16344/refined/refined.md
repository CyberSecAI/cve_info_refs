{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises from the way ZZCMS 8.3 handles file paths when processing video uploads. Specifically, the system uses the provided `$flv` variable without proper sanitization, which enables a malicious actor to manipulate it.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper input validation of the `$flv` variable, leading to arbitrary file deletion.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the `$flv` variable to point to the file they wish to delete.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request while posting advertisement information. They specify a network address for the video, intercept the request, and modify the `flv` parameter to the path of the file to be deleted. When the advertisement is deleted, this malicious data is used, triggering the file deletion.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to post advertisement information and capture the HTTP request to modify the `flv` parameter. They also need to know or guess the path of the file they want to delete."
