{
  "CVE-2018-16137": {
    "Root cause": "Lack of proper input validation in forms within the IPBrickOS administrative interface.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "SQL injection vulnerabilities exist in both authenticated and unauthenticated parts of the application.",
      "Insufficient input sanitization and validation."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially leaking sensitive information such as user credentials, configurations, and other sensitive data. This can lead to privilege escalation and compromise of the entire system.",
    "Attack vectors": "HTTP POST requests to vulnerable endpoints, such as `generateXMLStats_proxy.php`, `generateXMLAccesses_ssl.php`, `generateXMLAccesses_ppp.php`, `generateXMLAccesses_ftp.php` (unauthenticated) and GET requests to endpoints like `/corpo.php` with vulnerable parameters (authenticated).",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests. For authenticated SQL injection, they must also have valid administrator credentials to log into the IPBrickOS admin interface. The unauthenticated SQL injection can be exploited without any prior authentication."
