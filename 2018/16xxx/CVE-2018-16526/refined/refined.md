{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `usGenerateProtocolChecksum` function in FreeRTOS+TCP calculates checksums for upper-layer protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP) using the `ucVersionHeaderLength` field of the IP header. The `prvProcessIPPacket` function removes IP options from a packet but does not update `ucVersionHeaderLength`. This leads to an incorrect offset calculation in `usGenerateProtocolChecksum`, causing it to calculate and place the checksum at an incorrect memory location, potentially out of bounds.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect IP header length handling after removing IP options.",
      "Use of an unvalidated field (`ucVersionHeaderLength`) in offset calculation.",
      "Lack of bounds checking during checksum generation."
    ],
    "impact": "Memory corruption due to writing the checksum at an incorrect offset which can potentially lead to information leaks or remote code execution. The impact is more severe with dynamic memory allocation (BufferAllocation_2.c) as out-of-bounds writes can corrupt other heap allocated objects, potentially leading to code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted IP packet with IP options to a vulnerable FreeRTOS device.",
      "Triggering a code path that causes a transmission to be built over, or based on, the IP header of the corrupted RX packet."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target device, specifically IP packets with IP options. No additional capabilities required."
