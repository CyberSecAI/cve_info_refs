{
  "CVE-2018-16865": {
    "Description": "A stack overflow vulnerability exists in systemd when receiving many journald entries, due to an uncontrolled allocation using alloca(). This allows an attacker to potentially cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `journal_file_append_entry()` function uses `alloca()` to allocate space on the stack, and the size of the allocation is directly controlled by the number of journal entries sent to it.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Uncontrolled resource allocation, stack overflow.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (crash of systemd and thus the entire OS) or potentially arbitrary code execution with journald privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending many crafted journal entries to the journald socket (`/run/systemd/journal/socket`), or through a `systemd-journal-remote` service listening on the network.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local or remote network access to the system, depending on whether using the local journald socket, or the `systemd-journal-remote` service."
