Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-16181:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an HTTP header injection vulnerability. This arises from improper handling of input when constructing HTTP headers, allowing an attacker to inject malicious content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **HTTP Header Injection (CWE-113):** The primary weakness is the application's failure to properly sanitize or validate user-controlled input that's incorporated into HTTP headers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **HTTP Response Splitting:** A successful exploit can lead to an HTTP response splitting attack.
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary scripts in the victim's browser, typically through injecting malicious JavaScript.
- **Arbitrary Cookie Manipulation:** An attacker can also set arbitrary cookie values, potentially gaining unauthorized access or performing other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based. Exploitation is done by sending crafted requests over the network to the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Special Privileges:** No prior user authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
- **User Interaction:** User interaction is required, meaning a user must visit a malicious link or website in order for the attack to be executed.
- **Low Attack Complexity:** The attack complexity is low. This indicates that the attacker can reliably exploit the vulnerability without requiring exceptional technical expertise.
