{
  "CVE-2018-16299": {
    "Description": "The WordPress plugin Localize My Post 1.0 is vulnerable to local file inclusion due to the lack of sanitization of the 'file' parameter in the `/localize-my-post/ajax/include.php` file.",
    "Root cause": "The `include()` function in `/localize-my-post/ajax/include.php` uses the unsanitized `$_REQUEST['file']` parameter, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary local files.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
      "Lack of input sanitization"
    ],
    "Impact": "Public defacement, confidential data leakage, database server compromise, and complete compromise of client systems.",
    "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `/localize-my-post/ajax/include.php` with a malicious `file` parameter.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required."
  }
