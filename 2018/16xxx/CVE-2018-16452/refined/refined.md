{
  "CVE-2018-16452": {
    "description": "The SMB parser in tcpdump before 4.9.3 has stack exhaustion in smbutil.c:smb_fdata() via recursion.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of a limit on the recursion depth within the smb_fdata function in the SMB parser.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack exhaustion due to unbounded recursion"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by triggering the stack exhaustion. Depending on system and memory layout, it is possible this could lead to more serious issues.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network: By crafting a malicious SMB packet which, when parsed by tcpdump, triggers excessive recursion."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send or inject network traffic which will be parsed by a vulnerable instance of tcpdump."
  }
