Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The WordPress plugin "Event Calendar WD" failed to properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it on the page, leading to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the plugin did not use `esc_html()` or similar functions on several output locations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to stored XSS because it doesn't sanitize data before outputting it to the page. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into various fields, including event titles, organizer information, venue details, etc., and then executed when an admin or user views the affected pages.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The core issue is the absence of proper input sanitization before outputting data, which allows for the injection of malicious scripts.
   - The vulnerability occurs because the plugin displays data without escaping HTML entities in several files. Examples include:
      - `includes/ecwd_class-rest-api.php`
      - `js/admin/admin.js`
      - `views/admin/ecwd-calendar-meta.php`
      - `views/admin/ecwd-event-calendars-meta.php`
      - `views/admin/ecwd-event-meta.php`
      - `views/admin/ecwd-event-organizers-meta.php`
      - `views/admin/ecwd-event-venues-meta.php`
      - `views/admin/ecwd-organizer-meta.php`
      - `views/admin/ecwd-venue-meta.php`
      - `views/ecwd-event-content.php`
      - `views/ecwd-event-popup.php`
      - `views/ecwd-organizer-content.php`
 -  The fix implemented in version 1.1.22 addresses this by using `esc_html()` to escape output values

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of a logged-in user.
- **Malicious Actions:** This could lead to a range of malicious activities, such as:
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    - Stealing session cookies.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.
    - Gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data
- **Compromised User Accounts:** An attacker could potentially use XSS to escalate privileges or compromise administrator accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, as the attacker injects the malicious script through HTTP requests.
- **Plugin Input:** The malicious payload is injected through the plugin's input fields for events, organizers, and venues.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker only needs to have low privileges like a regular user to inject the malicious code.
- **Ability to Add/Edit Events, Organizers, or Venues:** The attacker needs to be able to add/edit events, organizers, or venues within the WordPress admin panel to insert the XSS payload.
- **User Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when another user views the page that displays the injected content.

**Additional Notes:**
- The plugin has been closed on the WordPress plugin directory because of security issues
- The vendor was notified and released a fix.
- The fix involves applying the `esc_html()` function to multiple locations within the code to ensure data output is sanitized.

This vulnerability is a classic example of a stored XSS vulnerability caused by insufficient output encoding.
