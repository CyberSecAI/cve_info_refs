Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-16308 (Although the exploit-db entry does not explicitly mention this CVE, the description and the affected version clearly indicate it refers to the same vulnerability)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a CSV injection vulnerability. This occurs because the plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied input properly before including it in a CSV file for export.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- CSV Injection: The plugin is vulnerable to CSV injection, where malicious code embedded within form fields is exported to CSV files. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine when the exported CSV is opened with a program like Microsoft Excel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: When a privileged user opens the exported CSV file, the injected code executes, potentially allowing the attacker to gain full control over the user's system.
- Data breaches: If an attacker injects code that is able to access other data sources, they might be able to compromise other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Form Fields:  An attacker can inject the malicious code into any form field on a vulnerable Ninja Forms instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to Submit Forms:  The attacker needs to be able to submit data through a form that uses the vulnerable Ninja Forms plugin. No elevated privileges on the WordPress instance are required to exploit this vulnerability.
- Social Engineering: The attack requires tricking a privileged user into downloading and opening the malicious CSV file.

**Technical Details:**
The provided exploit example uses the following payload format in a form field to execute arbitrary code on a Windows system:

```
=SUM(1+1)*cmd|' /C calc'!A0
+SUM(1+1)*cmd|' /C calc'!A0
-SUM(1+1)*cmd|' /C calc'!A0
@SUM(1+1)*cmd|' /C calc'!A0
```

This payload leverages the way spreadsheet software processes cell data, forcing execution of the included command. When a spreadsheet program opens a CSV file, the formula is processed and results in the execution of `calc.exe`, as an example.
This can be adjusted to execute arbitrary code on the victim machine.

**Additional Notes**
- The exploit-db entry states that the vulnerable version is 3.3.13 and before
- The wordpress.org content indicates that a patch for a similar vulnerability was included in version 3.6.26, implying that versions between 3.3.13 and 3.6.26 are likely vulnerable as well.
- The vulnerability exists because the plugin does not sanitize the user-controlled input before generating the CSV export file.
