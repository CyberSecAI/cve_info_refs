- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack-based buffer overflow
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Email Security versions 8.5.0 and 8.5.3.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could craft malicious input to potentially crash a process, leading to a denial-of-service. Although RCE is not confirmed, the possibility cannot be ruled out with buffer overflows.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by sending crafted, malicious input to the affected Email Security system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send malicious input to the Email Security system.
