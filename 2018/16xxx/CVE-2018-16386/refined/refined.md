Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the way the SWIFT Alliance Web Platform handles the `PATH_INFO` component of URLs, specifically in the `/swp/login/EJBRemoteService/` endpoint. It allows an attacker to inject arbitrary data into log files by manipulating the `PATH_INFO`.

* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    * **Log Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the `PATH_INFO` provided in the URL. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary data into the application's log files.
    * **Arbitrary Log Filename:** The vulnerability also enables attackers to control the filename of the created log file by injecting the desired name in the `PATH_INFO`.
* **Impact of Exploitation:**
    * **Log Manipulation:** An attacker can inject malicious log entries that might be used to obscure their activities, mislead administrators, or trigger alerts based on injected patterns, thus hindering monitoring and incident response.
    * **Information Disclosure:** An attacker might be able to create log files in arbitrary locations, potentially exposing internal information depending on log path configurations.
    * **Denial of Service:** Repeated exploitation could potentially lead to storage exhaustion if an attacker creates a large amount of logs.
* **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL with a malicious `PATH_INFO` parameter targeting the `/swp/login/EJBRemoteService/` endpoint.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the target system. There are no specific authentication or privileged access requirements specified in the description. This suggests a remote, unauthenticated attack.

**Technical Details:**
* The application generates an error message containing `null@java:comp/env/` followed by the injected data, which is then written to the log.
* The attacker can use a URL such as `https://target/swp/login/EJBRemoteService/@Injection_Here` to inject the log file name and arbitrary error log information.
