Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-16180:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the i-FILTER product from Digital Arts Inc. This is due to improper input validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS) (CWE-79):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts within the victim's web browser. This could lead to a variety of malicious actions, including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing sensitive information (e.g., cookies, login credentials)
    - Defacing websites
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- The attacker does not need any special privileges (PR:N).
- The user needs to interact with the malicious content (UI:R).
- The scope of the vulnerability is "Changed" (S:C), which means that the vulnerability can affect other resources or applications other than the vulnerable component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script into the application. This could be done by exploiting a vulnerable input field or through a stored XSS vulnerability.
- The attacker does not require any specific position within the network, as this is a network-based vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects i-FILTER Ver.9.50R05 and earlier versions.
- The provided CVSS scores are:
    - **CVSS v3:** 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)
    - **CVSS v2:** 4.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)
