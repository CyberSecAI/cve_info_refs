{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification in `sig_verify()` function in x509.c blindly trusts the declared lengths in the ASN.1 structure.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of signature data length",
      "Blind trust of declared lengths in ASN.1 structure"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can generate crafted signatures that induce illegal memory access, leading to a crash of the verifier, potentially resulting in a denial-of-service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attacks via crafted X.509 certificates"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to generate crafted signatures and include them in X.509 certificates.",
      "Remote network access."
    ],
    "details": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `sig_verify()` function in x509.c does not properly validate the length of the signature data within an X.509 certificate. Specifically, it trusts the lengths declared in the ASN.1 structure without proper checks. When a small public exponent is used, a remote attacker can exploit this by crafting signatures with manipulated lengths. This allows the attacker to trigger illegal memory accesses and potentially crash the verifier, leading to a denial-of-service. This issue is resolved by properly checking for expected data lengths and rejecting invalid signatures."
