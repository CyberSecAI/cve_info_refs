The provided content is related to CVE-2018-16745.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `fax_notify_mail` function in `faxrec.c` does not sanitize the `mail_to` parameter, leading to both command injection and a stack buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The `mail_to` parameter, when passed to `sprintf` into a local buffer `buf` of size 256, can overflow this buffer if it's too long.
- Command injection: The `mail_to` parameter is directly incorporated into a shell command using `popen`, making it vulnerable to command injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow could lead to arbitrary code execution, though the advisory classifies the impact as low.
- Command injection could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands.
- The impact is rated as low due to the configuration parameter requirement, which is expected to be set by a trusted source. However, a web front-end could be an attack vector.

**Attack vectors:**
- The `mail_to` parameter is a configuration option, so the attacker needs to be able to influence this option. If `mgetty` is used with a web frontend, an attacker could potentially manipulate this parameter, allowing privilege escalation.
- The `mail_to` parameter is passed to `fax_notify_mail`, which is called from `faxrec`, which is called from `main()` in `mgetty.c`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to modify the `notify_mail` configuration parameter of mgetty.
- This could involve compromising a web front-end if one is used, or having privileged access to the configuration.
