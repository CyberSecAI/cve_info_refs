{
  "CVE-2018-16392": {
    "Root cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `tcos_select_file` function of the OpenSC library when handling responses from TCOS cards.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The function `tcos_select_file` in `src/libopensc/card-tcos.c` extracts a filename from an APDU response and writes it into the internal `file->name` variable without checking if the retrieved string fits into the buffer. This leads to an out-of-bounds write if the length of the filename from the card is larger than the allocated buffer."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker who can supply crafted smart cards can cause a denial-of-service (application crash) or potentially have unspecified other impacts by triggering the buffer overflow.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a malicious smart card to a system running the OpenSC software.",
      "The attacker needs to supply a crafted TCOS smart card with a specially crafted response to an APDU command.",
       "By sending a malformed APDU response to the system, an attacker can trigger the out-of-bounds write in the `tcos_select_file` function."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted TCOS smart card to the system."
    ],
     "Additional Information": "The vulnerability was reported by X41 D-Sec GmbH. The issue was fixed in OpenSC version 0.19.0-rc1"
