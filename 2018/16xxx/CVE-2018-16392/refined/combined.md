# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

Debian Bug     : 909444 939668 939669

Several security vulnerabilities were fixed in opensc, a set of
libraries and utilities to access smart cards that support
cryptographic operations.

Out-of-bounds reads, buffer overflows and double frees could be used
by attackers able to supply crafted smart cards to cause a denial of
service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
0.16.0-3+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your opensc packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

# NEWS

X41 D-Sec GmbH Security Advisory: X41-2018-002

# Multiple Vulnerabilities in OpenSC

## Overview

**Confirmed Affected Versions:** 0.17.0

**Confirmed Patched Versions:** -

**Vendor:** OpenSC

**Vendor URL:** https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC

**Credit:** X41 D-Sec GmbH, Eric Sesterhenn

**Status:** Public

**Advisory-URL:** https://www.x41-dsec.de/lab/advisories/x41-2018-002-OpenSC/

## Summary and Impact

Multiple issues have been identified in OpenSC, ranging from stack based buffer overflows to out of bounds reads and writes on the heap. They can be triggered by malicious smartcards sending malformed responses to APDU commands. Additionally to those fixes reported here, a lot of minor issues (eg. OOB reads and similar) have been reported and fixed. The OpenSC team (especially Frank Morgner) did an excellent job on identifying and fixing further issues.

Due to the large amount of issues, no individual issues have been rated with CVSS / CVE ID yet.

X41 did not perform a full test or audit of the software, but tried to help identifying as many bugs as possible in over the course of a year.

## Product Description

OpenSC provides a set of libraries and utilities to work with smart cards. Its main focus is on cards that support cryptographic operations, and facilitate their use in security applications such as authentication, mail encryption and digital signatures.

# OOB Write in muscle\_list\_files()

In funcion `muscle_list_files()` in file src/libopensc/card-muscle.c an out of bounds write might occur, since `bufLen` is not checked.

```
static int muscle_list_files(sc_card_t *card, u8 *buf, size_t bufLen)
{
        muscle_private_t* priv = MUSCLE_DATA(card);
        mscfs_t *fs = priv->fs;
        int x;
        int count = 0;

        mscfs_check_cache(priv->fs);

        for(x = 0; x < fs->cache.size; x++) {
                u8* oid= fs->cache.array[x].objectId.id;
                sc_debug(card->ctx, SC_LOG_DEBUG_NORMAL,
                        "FILE: %02X%02X%02X%02X\n",
                        oid[0],oid[1],oid[2],oid[3]);
                if(0 == memcmp(fs->currentPath, oid, 2)) {
                        buf[0] = oid[2];
                        buf[1] = oid[3];
                        if(buf[0] == 0x00 && buf[1] == 0x00) continue; /* No directories/null names outside of root */
                        buf += 2;
                        count+=2;
                }
        }
        return count;
}
```

# OOB Write in tcos\_select\_file()

In function `tcos_select_file)` in file src/libopensc/card-tcos.c a filename is extracted from an APDU response and written into the internal `file->name` variable.

```
                case 0x84:
                        memcpy(file->name, d, len);
                        file->namelen = len;
                        break;
```

No check is performed whether the string retrieved from the card fits into the buffer, which could trigger an OOB write.

# OOB Write in piv\_validate\_general\_authentication()

In case `piv_validate_general_authentication()`in src/libopensc/card-piv.c is called with a `datalen` parameter greater than 4096, an out of bound write occurs. Currently no caller seems to do this.

# OOB Write in gemsafe\_get\_cert\_len()

The function `gemsafe_get_cert_len()` in file src/libopensc/pkcs15-gemsafeV1.c might write beyond the `gemsafe_prkeys` and `gemsafe_cert` arrays in case more than 12 containers are stored on the card.

```
        ind = 2; /* skip length */
        while (ibuf[ind] == 0x01) {
                if (ibuf[ind+1] == 0xFE) {
                        gemsafe_prkeys[i].ref = ibuf[ind+4];
                        sc_log(card->ctx, "Key container %d is allocated and uses key_ref %d",
                                        i+1, gemsafe_prkeys[i].ref);
                        ind += 9;
                }
                else {
                        gemsafe_prkeys[i].label = NULL;
                        gemsafe_cert[i].label = NULL;
                        sc_log(card->ctx, "Key container %d is unallocated", i+1);
                        ind += 8;
                }
                i++;
        }
```

# OOB Write in util\_acl\_to\_str()

In function `util_acl_to_str()` in file src/tools/util.c no checks are performed whether the string put together fits into `line`, which could be abused to trigger limited out of bounds writes.

# OOB Write in read\_public\_key() and read\_private\_key()

In function `read_public_key()` in file src/tools/cryptoflex-tool.c the `bufsize` variable is overwritten with `file->size` retrieved from the smartcard. This could be bigger than 2048, allowing for a stack based buffer overflow in the `sc_read_binary()` call.

```
        u8 buf[2048], *p = buf;
        size_t bufsize, keysize;

        r = select_app_df();
        if (r)
                return 1;
        sc_format_path("I1012", &path);
        r = sc_select_file(card, &path, &file);
        if (r) {
                fprintf(stderr, "Unable to select public key file: %s\n", sc_strerror(r));
                return 2;
        }
        bufsize = file->size;
        sc_file_free(file);
        r = sc_read_binary(card, 0, buf, bufsize, 0);
```

The same issue can be found in `read_private_key()`

```
        bufsize = file->size;
        sc_file_free(file);
        r = sc_read_binary(card, 0, buf, bufsize, 0);
```

# OOB Write in decrypt\_response()

In function `decrypt_response()` in file src/libopensc/card-epass2003.c an out of bounds overwrite can occur. No check is performed if the `plaintext` buffer fits into the `out` buffer before copying, leading to a memory overwrite.

```
        memcpy(out, plaintext, in_len - 2);
        *out_len = in_len - 2;
        return 0;
```

# OOB Write in cac\_get\_serial\_nr\_from\_CUID()

In function `cac_get_serial_nr_from_CUID()` in file src/libopensc/card-cac.c a serial number is copied into `serial->value`. The length argument of the `memcpy()` is the length of the source, not the destination, which can lead to an out of bounds memory write.

```
        if (priv->cac_id_len) {
                serial->len = MIN(priv->cac_id_len, SC_MAX_SERIALNR);
                memcpy(serial->value, priv->cac_id, priv->cac_id_len);
                SC_FUNC_RETURN(card->ctx, SC_LOG_DEBUG_NORMAL, SC_SUCCESS);
        }

# Off by One Write in sc\_pkcs15emu\_esteid\_init()

In function `sc_pkcs15emu_esteid_init()` in file src/libopensc/pkcs15-esteid.c an off by one write with a `\x00` occurs in case the `sc_read_record()` functions returns `sizeof(buf)` read bytes.

```
        /* read the serial (document number) */
        r = sc_read_record (card, SC_ESTEID_PD_DOCUMENT_NR, buff, sizeof(buff), SC_RECORD_BY_REC_NR);
        SC_TEST_RET(card->ctx, SC_LOG_DEBUG_NORMAL, r, "read document number failed");
        buff[r] = '\0';
```

# Double Free in sc\_file\_set\_sec\_attr()

In function `sc_file_set_sec_attr()` in file src/libopensc/sc.c a double free occurs in case `sec_attr_len` is equal to 0, since the call to `realloc()` will free `file->sec_attr` and return NULL. The variable is then freed again in the error handling path.

```
        tmp = (u8 *) realloc(file->sec_attr, sec_attr_len);
        if (!tmp) {
                if (file->sec_attr)
                        free(file->sec_attr);
                file->sec_attr     = NULL;
                file->sec_attr_len = 0;
                return SC_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY;
        }
```

# Double Free in read\_file()

In function `read_file()` in file src/tools/egk-tool.c a double free can be triggered in case two calls to `sc_select_file()` return a `file->size` of zero. The first call to `realloc()` frees the memory, the second frees it again.

```
        len = file ? file->size : 4096;
        p = realloc(*data, len);
        if (!p) {
                goto err;
        }
```

# Double free in sc\_pkcs15emu\_sc\_hsm\_init()

In function `sc_pkcs15emu_sc_hsm_init()` in file src/libopensc/pkcs15-sc-hsm.c a double free can occur, since this function can be called twice. The call to `realloc()` with a size of 0 would free `priv->EF_C_DevAut` with a second call freeing the already freed memory.

```
                /* save EF_C_DevAut for further use */
                ptr = realloc(priv->EF_C_DevAut, len);
                if (ptr) {
                        memcpy(ptr, efbin, len);
                        priv->EF_C_DevAut = ptr;
                        priv->EF_C_DevAut_len = len;
                }

                ptr = efbin;
```

# Unbound Recursion in iasecc\_select\_mf()/iasecc\_select\_file()

Function `iasecc_select_file()` in file src/libopensc/card-iasecc.c calls `iasecc_select_mf()` in the same file, which calls `iasecc_select_file()` again. This can lead to an infinite recursion exhausting the stack.
