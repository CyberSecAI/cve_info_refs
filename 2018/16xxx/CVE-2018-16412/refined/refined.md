Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2018-16412 and CVE-2018-16413:

**CVE-2018-16412**

*   **Root cause:** Heap-based buffer over-read in the `ParseImageResourceBlocks` function in `coders/psd.c`.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer over-read, suggesting an issue where the code reads beyond the allocated memory buffer on the heap.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could lead to a denial of service (DoS) due to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution, which is suggested by one of the sources.
*  **Attack vectors:** This can be triggered when ImageMagick processes a specially crafted PSD image file, where the attacker has to provide a malicious image.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious image file to a system that uses ImageMagick.

**CVE-2018-16413**

*   **Root cause:** Heap-based buffer over-read in the `PushShortPixel` function, called from the `ParseImageResourceBlocks` function in `coders/psd.c`
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in a heap-based buffer over-read within the `PushShortPixel` function, triggered by the parsing of a PSD file's resource blocks.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could lead to a denial of service (DoS) due to a crash, possibly some memory corruption if exploited.
*   **Attack vectors:** This can be triggered when ImageMagick processes a specially crafted PSD image file. The attacker has to provide a malicious image.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious image file to a system that uses ImageMagick.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Both CVEs are present in ImageMagick and are related to PSD file handling.
*   The vulnerabilities are triggered by malformed or specially crafted files.
*   User interaction is required because the user has to open the malicious file, which triggers the vulnerability.
*   Multiple sources note that a fix for these issues has been released.
* Some sources also report a regression in dcm coder which is also part of the same ImageMagick security update.

The information from the provided documents provides a good explanation of the root cause, impact, and how these vulnerabilities are triggered.
