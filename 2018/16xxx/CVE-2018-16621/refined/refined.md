Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** While the provided text does not directly mention CVE-2018-16621, it discusses a bypass of the mitigations implemented for it. The bypass itself is assigned **CVE-2020-10204**.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a bypass of the fix for CVE-2018-16621 in Nexus Repository Manager. The original fix involved stripping out EL delimiters `${}` from user-controlled input using a regular expression. However, vulnerabilities in Hibernate-Validation and Java EL allow the EL expression engine to process expressions that do not use standard `${}` delimiters. This means the `stripJavaEL` method fails to sanitize certain forms of EL injection, re-enabling the original vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate input sanitization: The `stripJavaEL` method only filters the standard EL delimiters (`${}`), failing to account for alternative forms of EL expressions.
- Vulnerabilities in Hibernate-Validation and Java EL: These libraries incorrectly process EL expressions not wrapped by `${}`, leading to injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): A high-privileged user can execute arbitrary code on the server by injecting malicious EL expressions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- User-controlled data submitted to the following endpoints are vulnerable:
  - `TaskXO.groovy [cronExpression]` via `CronExpressionValidator`
  - `UserXO.groovy [roles]`, `RoleXO.groovy [roles]`, and `UserRoleMappingsXO.groovy [roles]` via `RolesExistValidator`
  - `RoleXO.groovy` via `PrivilegesExistValidator`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a high-privileged user who can access and modify the vulnerable endpoints.
- They need the ability to craft and submit malicious EL expressions that bypass the `stripJavaEL` sanitization.

**Additional Information:**
- The identified endpoints and the specific fields within those objects that are vulnerable to the EL injection are listed in the content.
- The vulnerability was reported to Sonatype on 02/03/2020, and they acknowledged it the same day.
- The report was credited to Alvaro Munoz (@pwntester) of the GHSL team.
