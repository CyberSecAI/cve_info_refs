{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The endpoint `/cgi-bin/luci/;stok=<stok>/api/xqsmarthome/request_mitv` accepts a JSON-formatted URL parameter called payload. The application backend does not sufficiently validate or sanitize the supplied data, specifically the `url` field, which leads to command injection vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Command Injection",
    "Insufficient input validation",
    "Insufficient input sanitization"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Authenticated users can run arbitrary system commands on the router with root privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint `/cgi-bin/luci/;stok=<stok>/api/xqsmarthome/request_mitv` with a malicious `payload` parameter containing a command injection in the `url` JSON field.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the router."
