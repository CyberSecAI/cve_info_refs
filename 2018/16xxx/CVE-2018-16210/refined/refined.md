{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The WAGO 750-881 Ethernet Controller devices have a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the SNMP configuration via the webserv/cplcfg/snmp.ssi page.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web interface, potentially leading to actions performed in the context of a user's session, such as stealing cookies, redirecting to malicious sites, or performing administrative actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the web interface at the `/webserv/cplcfg/snmp.ssi` endpoint by injecting malicious javascript code into the `SNMP_DESC`, `SNMP_LOC_SNMP_CONT`  form fields.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable web interface of the WAGO device. The attacker must have network access to the device."
