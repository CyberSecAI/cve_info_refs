Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation in the `filesmanager` component of Monstra CMS. The `path` parameter, which is intended to specify a file path, is not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject directory traversal sequences.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a directory traversal flaw. By using sequences like `../` and `.` within the `path` parameter, an attacker can navigate outside the intended directories.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The software fails to properly validate and sanitize the `path` parameter before using it to access files, which is the fundamental cause of the traversal vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** By traversing the directory structure, an attacker could gain access to sensitive files and directories that are not meant to be publicly accessible, potentially revealing configuration files, source code, or other critical information.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Depending on the files they access, an attacker might be able to identify other vulnerabilities, such as the possibility to modify configuration files, gain further control over the system or even escalate privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the `admin/index.php` script, specifically targeting the `filesmanager` component and supplying a crafted `path` parameter with directory traversal sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Monstra CMS instance to send the crafted HTTP request.
- **Knowledge of Target:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable endpoint (`admin/index.php?id=filesmanager`) and the vulnerable `path` parameter.
- **No Authentication:** The provided information does not specify the need for user authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable parameter is `path` within `admin/index.php?id=filesmanager`.
- The attacker uses `uploads/.......//./.......//./.......//./.......//./.......//./.......//./` sequence in the path to traverse the directory structure.
- The provided images show that the attacker was able to list the files on the server.
