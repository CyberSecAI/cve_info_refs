{
  "CVE-2018-16133": {
    "related_content": true,
    "summary": "Cybrotech CyBroHttpServer 1.0.3 is vulnerable to directory traversal, allowing attackers to read sensitive information.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when handling file requests, allowing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to bypass access restrictions.",
       "vulnerabilities": [
        "Directory Traversal"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server's file system, potentially exposing sensitive information such as configuration files, source code, or other confidential data.",
      "attack_vectors": "By sending a crafted HTTP GET request with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../Windows/win.ini`) in the requested URI, an attacker can access files outside of the web server's root directory.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is needed."
    }
  }
