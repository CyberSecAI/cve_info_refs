Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2018-16220:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Vulnerability 1 (Admin password change without authentication):** Lack of authentication checks on the web interface when changing the admin password.
*   **Vulnerability 2 (Command injection):** Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input to diagnostic functions within the web interface, allowing command injection.
*   **Vulnerability 3 (Cross-site Scripting - XSS):** Inadequate sanitization of user-supplied input in various fields on the web interface, enabling the injection of JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The web interface allows changing the administrator password without requiring the current password.
*   **Command Injection:** The web interface's diagnostic tools improperly handle user-supplied inputs, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Input fields in the web interface do not properly sanitize user inputs, leading to reflected XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can achieve remote root shell access by combining vulnerability 1 (password reset) and vulnerability 2 (command injection) enabling full control of the device.
*   **Arbitrary System Command Execution:** An authenticated user can inject and execute arbitrary commands due to the command injection vulnerability in the diagnostic functions.
*   **JavaScript Injection:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the web interface through XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Device Control:** Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows an attacker to completely control the device.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The webserver runs as root, therefore injected commands execute with root privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be on the same network as the targeted device.
*   **Web Interface:** All vulnerabilities are exploited through the device's web interface.
*   **HTTP requests:** Vulnerabilities are triggered by sending crafted HTTP requests (POST and GET)
*   **DHCP Poisoning:** XSS can be triggered by injecting a malicious domain via a rogue DHCP server.
*   **Address book or device configuration file manipulation:** XSS can be triggered by loading manipulated configuration files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be on the same local network as the vulnerable device.
*   **HTTP request manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to construct and send specific HTTP requests.
*   **Basic Understanding of HTTP and web requests:** Understanding how HTTP POST and GET requests work is needed.
*   **Initial Access:** In the case of the command injection the attacker needs to be able to log in with the current admin password or to have reset it using vulnerability 1.

**Additional Details (beyond CVE description):**

*   **Exploit Chain:** The document describes an exploit chain using vulnerability 1 and 2 to get a remote root shell.
*   **Specific vulnerable parameters:** The document outlines the vulnerable parameters to trigger the vulnerabilities
*   **Proof of Concept:** The document includes example `curl` commands to demonstrate how to trigger each vulnerability.
*   **Specific vulnerable areas:** The document outlines the vulnerable areas of the application, such as the admin password change, diagnostic functions, and input fields
*   **Workaround suggestion:** The document suggests limiting network access to the web interface with firewall rules, and mentions that blocking telnet is insufficient, as it is possible to establish a reverse shell.
*   **Fix Suggestion:** The document mentions that input sanitization should be handled on the server side, not the client side. It also suggests to run the web server under a restricted user instead of root.
