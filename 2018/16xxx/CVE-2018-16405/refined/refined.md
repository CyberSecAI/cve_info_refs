The provided content relates to CVE-2018-16405.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. The application directly uses the value from `window.location.hash` to set the `window.location`, without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the direct use of `window.location.hash` content in the `window.location` assignment. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the URL's hash portion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
By crafting a malicious URL containing JavaScript in the hash, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser when the user visits the vulnerable page. This can result in session hijacking, data theft, or any other action the attacker can perform with JavaScript within the context of the web application.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a crafted URL that contains JavaScript code within its hash component.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to construct and distribute a crafted URL to the victim. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
The vulnerability exists on the following pages:
1. /authentication/login/
2. /authentication/password/reset/done/
3. /authentication/password/reset/
