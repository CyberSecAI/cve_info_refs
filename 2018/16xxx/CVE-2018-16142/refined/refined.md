{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The program doesn't filter the `_back` parameter in the `ok_f()` function within `framework/www/login_control.php`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a logged-in user's session, potentially leading to cookie theft or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `_back` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to entice a logged-in user to click on the crafted malicious link. Alternatively, the attacker could force the redirect to the login page, and after login the XSS would trigger."
