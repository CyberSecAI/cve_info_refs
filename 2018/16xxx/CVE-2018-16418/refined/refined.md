{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to a lack of bounds checking when concatenating strings in the `util_acl_to_str` function in `tools/util.c` of the OpenSC library.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers with the ability to supply crafted smart cards can exploit the buffer overflow, leading to a denial of service (application crash) and potentially other unspecified impacts.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Physical access to the system with the ability to supply a crafted smart card."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the capability to supply a crafted smart card to the vulnerable system.",
    "details": "The `util_acl_to_str` function in `tools/util.c` does not perform checks to ensure the concatenated string fits within the destination buffer (`line`). This allows an attacker to trigger a buffer overflow by providing a smart card that results in an overly long string when processed by this function."
