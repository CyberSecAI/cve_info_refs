Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-16737:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from `tinc-vpn.org` and `starwindsoftware.com` explicitly mentions CVE-2018-16737, confirming its relevance.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the authentication protocol of tinc versions 1.0.29 and earlier. This protocol lacks proper mitigation against oracle attacks.
*  The StarWind advisory specifically states: "tinc before 1.0.30 has a broken authentication protocol, without even a partial mitigation."

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Broken Authentication Protocol:** The core issue is a flawed authentication mechanism that can be exploited.
*   **Oracle Attack:** The vulnerable protocol allows for an oracle attack. This means an attacker can interact with the system in a way that reveals information about internal states through a "go/no go" response.
*   **Lack of Mitigation:** The advisory emphasizes the complete absence of mitigation in the affected tinc versions.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **One-way Communication:** An attacker can establish one-way communication with a vulnerable tinc node.
*   **Fake Control Messages:** The attacker can send fake control messages.
*   **Packet Injection:** The attacker can inject packets into the VPN.
*   The `tinc-vpn.org` content states that the attacker could "send fake control messages and inject packets into the VPN."

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Attack:** The attack can be carried out remotely over a network.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the vulnerable tinc node over the network.
*   **No special access:** The attacker does not require any authentication prior to exploiting the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Timing attack:** The vulnerability has some relation to a timing attack, described in the wikipedia document, that can be used for discovery.
*   **Affected Products:** The StarWind advisory lists the affected products as StarWind VSAN for vSphere builds 12533 and 12658, and also mentions that tinc 1.1pre14 is affected when configured to allow connections from legacy 1.0.x protocol nodes.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in StarWind VSAN for vSphere build 12859, and tinc 1.1pre15 and later.
*   **Time to exploit:**  According to `tinc-vpn.org` "The attack takes only a few seconds to complete."

**Summary of Extracted Information:**

CVE-2018-16737 is a vulnerability in the tinc VPN software, specifically versions 1.0.29 and earlier. The vulnerability lies in a broken authentication protocol that is susceptible to an oracle attack. This allows remote attackers to establish one-way communication, send fake control messages and inject packets into the VPN. StarWind VSAN for vSphere products were affected, with a fix being available in build 12859. Tinc 1.1pre14 and earlier are affected when configured to allow connections from legacy 1.0.x protocol nodes.
