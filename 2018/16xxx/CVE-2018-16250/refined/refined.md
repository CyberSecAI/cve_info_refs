Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization/validation when handling user-provided data in the "first name" and "last name" fields within the user profile settings of WityCMS version 0.6.2. This allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code into these fields.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a persistent XSS because the malicious payload is stored in the database and executed each time the affected user's profile page is accessed or when the input boxes are clicked.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user inputs for the "first name" and "last name" fields before storing them in the database.
- **Lack of Output Encoding:**  The application renders the stored input values without properly encoding them, allowing the injected JavaScript to execute in the user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browser of any user who views or interacts with the affected user profiles.
- **Cookie Theft:** The provided payload demonstrates stealing cookies (`alert(document.cookie)`), which could be used to hijack user sessions.
- **Malicious redirects:** An attacker could redirect users to malicious websites.
- **Defacement:** An attacker could alter the appearance of the website for other users.
- **Data manipulation:** An attacker could potentially manipulate data within the application if they gain sufficient access.
- **Full account compromise:** By stealing session cookies an attacker could gain full access to the affected users account.

**Attack vectors:**
- **User profile modification:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code by modifying their own "first name" and "last name" user profile settings.
- **Stored XSS:** Once injected, the malicious code persists in the database and is triggered when the profile is displayed.
- **Targeting other users:** Any user who accesses the profile containing the injected code is potentially vulnerable to the payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated user:** An attacker must be a registered user of the WityCMS application with the ability to modify their user profile information.
- **Basic Web Development knowledge:** An attacker would need a basic understanding of how to inject malicious JavaScript and XSS vulnerabilities.

**Additional notes:**

- The vulnerability is located within the "utilisateur" menu, specifically at the input points for user information (first name and last name).
- The `apps/user/admin/view.php` file is involved in handling the user data, as the payload is submitted to this location.
- The issue is reproducible by entering the payload `" onclick="alert(document.cookie)"` into the first name or last name fields and observing that when you click on the input fields a javascript alert is triggered.
