- Root cause of vulnerability: Regular users can modify the `repository_storage` value of a project via the API.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper access control, where non-admin users can modify a setting that should be restricted to administrators.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can potentially disrupt project operations or gain unauthorized access to stored repositories by changing the `repository_storage` setting.
- Attack vectors: Exploitation is done through the API by sending a PUT request to update a project and specifying the `repository_storage` parameter with an unauthorized value.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be a regular user with project update access permissions and access to the GitLab API. They also require a private token.
