Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-16523 and CVE-2018-16524:

**Vulnerability:** TCP Options Handling Issues

**Root Cause:** The `prvCheckOptions` function in the FreeRTOS TCP/IP stack does not properly validate the boundaries of TCP options within a received TCP packet. It iterates through the options based on the provided length, but it doesn't ensure that both the start and end of each option remain within the packet's valid boundaries.

**Weaknesses:**
   - **Out-of-bounds read:** The code reads data beyond the bounds of the packet buffer when processing TCP options. This is due to lack of validation that the TCP options remain within the allocated buffer.
   - **Division by zero:** The `TCP_OPT_MSS` handler has a vulnerability where, if an attacker supplies an MSS value of 0, a division by zero occurs when calculating `RxWindowLength`, causing a denial of service.

**Impact:**
   - **Information Leak:** Attackers can potentially read sensitive information from device memory by exploiting the out-of-bounds read vulnerability. They can cause the device to leak data from memory locations outside the intended packet buffer by crafting specific TCP packets with particular options and lengths.
   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** The division by zero vulnerability within the `TCP_OPT_MSS` handler leads to a crash, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
   - A remote attacker can send crafted TCP packets to the target device. These packets must contain specific TCP options, potentially with manipulated lengths to trigger the out-of-bounds read, and an MSS value of zero to trigger the DoS condition.
   - The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - Ability to send network packets to the target device.
   - Knowledge of how to craft TCP packets with specific options and lengths to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
   - The `pucLast` pointer in the `prvCheckOptions` function is not validated to ensure it is within the received packet's boundaries.
   - The while loop condition only checks if the current option's start is within the valid range, not its end.
   - The TCP options handlers can access data out of bounds.

The content provides detailed information about the code flow and the specific conditions that trigger these vulnerabilities. It also explains the potential impacts like memory leaks and denial of service.
