Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists in Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 SP3 (and potentially earlier versions), specifically within the `/owa/auth/logon.aspx` login page. The `username` parameter is vulnerable to SSRF.

**Weaknesses:**
- The application processes the `username` parameter without proper sanitization or validation.
- It allows the attacker to influence the server to make requests to arbitrary domains.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can force the vulnerable server to make DNS queries to an attacker-controlled domain. This is explicitly stated in the Proof of Concept.
- More generally, the attacker can force the vulnerable server to send requests to any remote server they choose. The content does not go into specific potential impacts of arbitrary HTTP requests.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `/owa/auth/logon.aspx` login page.
- Specifically, the `username` parameter is used to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Exchange server.
- They do not need valid credentials.
- The attacker needs to be able to receive DNS or other traffic to the target server (e.g. `xxx.com` in the example), to observe the SSRF requests.
- Basic knowledge of HTTP requests and the vulnerable parameter is required.

**Proof of Concept (PoC):**
1.  Send a login request to `/owa/auth/logon.aspx`.
2.  Set the `username` parameter to the format: `ssrf.xxx.com\pentest`, where `xxx.com` is the attacker's controlled domain.
3.  The password parameter can be anything.
4.  The vulnerable server will send out DNS queries to `xxx.com`. The attacker can capture these DNS requests to confirm exploitation.

**Timeline:**
*   **19/06/2018:** Vulnerability discovered.
*   **22/06/2018:** Vendor (Microsoft) contacted.
