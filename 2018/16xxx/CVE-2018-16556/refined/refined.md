- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  Improper input validation when processing specially crafted packets sent to port 102/tcp.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of input data within the SIMATIC S7-400 CPU family when processing network packets. Specifically, the weakness is classified as CWE-20: Improper Input Validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can cause the affected devices to enter a "defect mode", leading to a denial of service condition. The system's core functionality is disrupted, compromising its availability. A manual reboot is required to restore normal operation.
- **Attack vectors:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted packets via Ethernet, PROFIBUS, or Multi Point Interfaces (MPI) to port 102/tcp.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted network packets to the affected devices through port 102/tcp via Ethernet, PROFIBUS or MPI interfaces. No user interaction or privileges are necessary for the exploit to be successful.
