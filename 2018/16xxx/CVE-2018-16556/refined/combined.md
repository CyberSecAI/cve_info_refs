SSA-113131: Denial of Service Vulnerabilities in SIMATIC S7-400
CPUs

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 8.2

2018-11-13
2023-05-09
V1.5

SUMMARY

Two vulnerabilities have been identiﬁed in the SIMATIC S7-400 CPU family that could allow an attacker to
cause a denial of service condition. In order to exploit the vulnerabilities, an attacker must have access to
the affected devices on port 102/tcp via Ethernet, PROFIBUS or Multi Point Interfaces (MPI).

Siemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest
versions. Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet
available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• CVE-2018-16557: Conﬁgure protection level 3 (read/write protection)
• Restrict network access to affected devices; restrict network access to port 102/tcp for Ethernet

interfaces

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC S7-400 controllers have been designed for discrete and continuous control in industrial environ-
ments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-16556

Specially crafted packets sent to port 102/tcp via Ethernet interface, via PROFIBUS, or via Multi Point
Interfaces (MPI) could cause the affected devices to go into defect mode. Manual reboot is required to
resume normal operation.

Successful exploitation requires an attacker to be able to send specially crafted packets to port 102/tcp
via Ethernet interface, via PROFIBUS or Multi Point Interfaces (MPI). No user interaction and no user
privileges are required to exploit the security vulnerability. The vulnerability could allow causing a
denial of service condition of the core functionality of the CPU, compromising the availability of the
system.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-16557

Sending of specially crafted packets to port 102/tcp via Ethernet interface via PROFIBUS or Multi
Point Interfaces (MPI) could cause a denial of service condition on affected devices. Flashing with a
ﬁrmware image may be required to recover the CPU.

Successful exploitation requires an attacker to have network access to port 102/tcp via Ethernet
interface or to be able to send messages via PROFIBUS or Multi Point Interfaces (MPI) to the device.
No user interaction is required. If no access protection is conﬁgured, no privileges are required to
exploit the security vulnerability. The vulnerability could allow causing a denial of service condition of
the core functionality of the CPU, compromising the availability of the system.
