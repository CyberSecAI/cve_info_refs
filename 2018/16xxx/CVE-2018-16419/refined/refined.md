  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `read_public_key` function of `cryptoflex-tool.c` in OpenSC, which occurs when handling responses from Cryptoflex cards. The `bufsize` variable is overwritten with a value from the card, allowing a larger size than the allocated buffer leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer overflow",
            "Insufficient bounds checking"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability could lead to a denial-of-service (application crash) or potentially other unspecified impact. An attacker could supply a crafted smartcard to trigger the vulnerability.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious smart card sending a malformed response to APDU commands."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to supply a crafted smart card to exploit the vulnerability."
