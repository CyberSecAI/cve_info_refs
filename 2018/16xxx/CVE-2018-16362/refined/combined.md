## Description

[![@dregad](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/449891?v=4&size=48)](/dregad)[dregad](https://github.com/dregad)opened [on Sep 1, 2018](https://github.com/mantisbt-plugins/source-integration/issues/286#issue-356221887)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Description

[![@dregad](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/449891?v=4&size=48)](/dregad)[dregad](https://github.com/dregad)opened [on Sep 1, 2018](https://github.com/mantisbt-plugins/source-integration/issues/285#issue-356192875)

Following merge of [#283](https://github.com/mantisbt-plugins/source-integration/pull/283), the revised French labels language were added (commit [a560a33](https://github.com/mantisbt-plugins/source-integration/commit/a560a339a73a47339acd7c6c8534f73bc5299b42)), but the old ones were not removed.

Thanks to [@okainov](https://github.com/okainov) who [pointed this out](https://github.com/mantisbt-plugins/source-integration/pull/283#discussion_r214085881).
