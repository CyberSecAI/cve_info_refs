Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of the `tag` parameter in the `mc-admin/post.php` file. The application directly uses the user-supplied `tag` parameter in the response HTML without encoding, leading to XSS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input (`tag` parameter) before rendering it in the HTML response.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the webpage. This can lead to:
*   Session hijacking
*   Stealing user cookies
*   Redirecting users to malicious sites
*   Performing actions on behalf of the user
*   Defacing the website
*   Other malicious activities

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `tag` parameter in the URL when the `state` parameter is set to either `delete`, `draft`, or `publish`. By crafting a URL containing malicious JavaScript code in the tag parameter, an attacker can inject the script into the page when it is rendered.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and have a victim user access the crafted link. The attacker does not require any special privileges on the system. They can be a remote attacker.
