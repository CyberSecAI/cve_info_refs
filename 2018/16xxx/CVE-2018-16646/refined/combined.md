# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

Package        : poppler
Version        : 0.26.5-2+deb8u5
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-18267 CVE-2018-10768 CVE-2018-13988 CVE-2018-16646
Debian Bug     : 898357 909802

Various security issues were discovered in the poppler PDF rendering
shared library.

CVE-2017-18267

    The FoFiType1C::cvtGlyph function in fofi/FoFiType1C.cc in Poppler
    through 0.64.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (infinite recursion) via a crafted PDF file, as demonstrated by
    pdftops.

    The applied fix in FoFiType1C::cvtGlyph prevents infinite recursion
    on such malformed documents.

CVE-2018-10768

    A NULL pointer dereference in the AnnotPath::getCoordsLength function
    in Annot.h in Poppler 0.24.5 had been discovered. A crafted input
    will lead to a remote denial of service attack. Later versions of
    Poppler such as 0.41.0 are not affected.

    The applied patch fixes the crash on AnnotInk::draw for malformed
    documents.

CVE-2018-13988

    Poppler through 0.62 contains an out of bounds read vulnerability due
    to an incorrect memory access that is not mapped in its memory space,
    as demonstrated by pdfunite. This can result in memory corruption and
    denial of service. This may be exploitable when a victim opens a
    specially crafted PDF file.

    The applied patch fixes crashes when Object has negative number.
    (Specs say, number has to be > 0 and gen >= 0).

    For Poppler in Debian jessie, the original upstream patch has been
    backported to Poppler's old Object API.

CVE-2018-16646

    In Poppler 0.68.0, the Parser::getObj() function in Parser.cc may
    cause infinite recursion via a crafted file. A remote attacker can
    leverage this for a DoS attack.

    A range of upstream patches has been applied to Poppler's XRef.cc in
    Debian jessie to consolidate a fix for this issue.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
0.26.5-2+deb8u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your poppler packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Package        : poppler
Version        : 0.26.5-2+deb8u6
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-16646

A regression issue has been resolved in the poppler PDF rendering
shared library introduced with version 0.26.5-2+deb8u5.

CVE-2018-16646

    In Poppler 0.68.0, the Parser::getObj() function in Parser.cc may
    cause infinite recursion via a crafted file. A remote attacker can
    leverage this for a DoS attack.

    The previous solution in Debian LTS fixed the above issue in XRef.cc,
    the patches had been obtained from a merge request (#67) on upstream's
    Git development platform. Unfortunately, this merge request was declined
    by upstream and another merge request (#91) got applied instead. The
    fix now directly occurs in the Parser.cc file.

    This version of poppler now ships the changeset that got favorized by
    the poppler upstream developers (MR #91) and drops the patches from
    MR #67.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
0.26.5-2+deb8u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your poppler packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

Package        : poppler
Version        : 0.26.5-2+deb8u7
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-16646
Debian Bug     :

A second regression issue has been resolved in the poppler PDF rendering
shared library this time introduced with version 0.26.5-2+deb8u6 (see
DLA 1562-2).

CVE-2018-16646

    In Poppler 0.68.0, the Parser::getObj() function in Parser.cc may
    cause infinite recursion via a crafted file. A remote attacker can
    leverage this for a DoS attack.

    The poppler upstream developers added two more regression fixes on top
    of the original fix (upstream merge request #91). These two patches
    have now been added to the poppler package in Debian jessie LTS.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
0.26.5-2+deb8u7.

We recommend that you upgrade your poppler packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1541358#c0)  Mikel Olasagasti    2018-02-02 11:27:45 UTC  ``` 1. Proposed title of this feature request Adobe PDF file autofit label feature for Evince  3. What is the nature and description of the request? We request that when Evince reads a PDF file that includes internal labels [1] it has to respect the printing labels as Adobe indicates [2], it sets up "temporally" the printer config to follow the label setup like Acrobat Reader does and prints the document properly. Once the program is closed and opened again or a different file is opened, Evince keeps its original printing configuration.  4. Why does the customer need this? (List the business requirements here) Customer needs Evince to print the PDF as it's configured internally in the file, without the user modifying the printer setup every time they need to print a different document [3] (we are speaking about how to avoid teaching more than 3000 people how to modify printing setup before printing and rollout the config after the document was printed depending of the type of document).  5. How would the customer like to achieve this? (List the functional requirements here) Evince needs to set up the printing configuration (page not autoscaled if the internal label of the document says so) if the pdf file indicates so. And that setup has to be temporal, just for printing that document, if I close Evince and open it again, the original set up has to come up. Right now Evince keeps saved the printing configuration if the user modifies it anytime.  6. For each functional requirement listed in question 5, specify how Red Hat and the customer can test to confirm the requirement is successfully implemented. We had provided documents prepared with the internal label to test if the application prints it properly. We can help doing the test in customer installations printing different documents with early Evince releases.  7. Is there already an existing RFE upstream or in Red Hat Bugzilla? I don't think so.  8. Does the customer have any specific timeline dependencies? We are coming from case #01943425 opened on Oct 02 2017, we would like to have this feature ASAP.  10. List any affected packages or components. evince-3.22.1-7.el7.x86_64.rpm  evince-libs-3.22.1-7.el7.x86_64.rpm  evince-nautilus-3.22.1-7.el7.x86_64.rpm gtk3-devel-docs-3.22.10-5.0.1.el7.x86_64.rpm gtk3-3.22.10-5.0.1.el7.x86_64.rpm gtk3-tests-3.22.10-5.0.1.el7.x86_64.rpm gtk3-immodule-xim-3.22.10-5.0.1.el7.x86_64.rpm gtk-update-icon-cache-3.22.10-5.0.1.el7.x86_64.rpm gtk3-devel-3.22.10-5.0.1.el7.x86_64.rpm gtk3-immodules-3.22.10-5.0.1.el7.x86_64.rpm gtk3-debuginfo-3.22.10-5.0.1.el7.x86_64.rpm  11.

The > stored value is listed in "gio info the-pdf-file.pdf"  This is wrong, the value of "Page Scaling" is stored globally for all documents in "~/.config/evince/print-settings" and not per document. So the "default" value should be the value which was used last for printing. The value "Shrink to Printable Area" is default only when you print from Evince for the first time.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1541358#c19)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-06 12:03:05 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1639595#c0)  Steffen Froemer    2018-10-16 07:34:45 UTC  ``` Description of problem: To provide fontnames to okular for example, it's required to have this supported by poppler.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): poppler-qt-0.26.5-20.el7  How reproducible: always  Steps to Reproduce: 1.  2. 3.  Actual results: Fontname is not provided, so it can't be shown on higher level  Expected results: poppler should provide access to fontname  Additional info:  ex. from okular: Helvetica Bold | Type 1 | /usr/share/fonts/default/Type1/n019004l.pfb  Expected results: Helvetica Bold | Type 1 | /usr/share/fonts/default/Type1/n019004l.pfb | NimbusSanL-Bold   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1639595#c3)  Jan Grulich    2018-10-16 07:36:44 UTC  ``` Should be doable for RHEL 7.7. This can be easily added to Qt bindings.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1639595#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-06 12:03:05 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.
