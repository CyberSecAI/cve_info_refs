Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-16749:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing NULL check when processing PNG images. Specifically, the `ReadOneJNGImage` function within the `coders/png.c` file does not properly verify if `color_image` is NULL before attempting to use it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is a missing NULL pointer check. When processing a crafted PNG image, the `color_image` variable could be NULL. The code then proceeds to call the function `WriteBlob` on this null `color_image` pointer, causing a crash due to dereferencing the null pointer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS). By providing a specially crafted PNG image, an attacker can trigger an application crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is a crafted PNG image file. The attacker needs to supply a malicious PNG file that, when processed by ImageMagick, will trigger the missing NULL check and the crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious image file to an application that uses ImageMagick for image processing. The attacker does not need any special privileges or access. The attacker's position is that of an external user providing untrusted input.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided patch checks for `(color_image != (Image *) NULL)` before using the `color_image` pointer.
- The vulnerability was found using a modified version of the kAFL fuzzer
- Ubuntu security notice USN-3785-1 also mentions that this vulnerability is a denial of service due to improper null checks during the processing of PNG images.
