  "CVE-2018-16846": {
    "description": "It was found that authenticated ceph RGW users can cause a denial of service against OMAPs holding bucket indices.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper bounds enforcement on operations performed by authenticated Ceph RGW users against OMAPs which store bucket indices.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of input validation",
      "Improper resource management"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit can result in denial of service by exhausting resources related to bucket indices.",
    "attack_vector": "Network",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be an authenticated Ceph RGW user with network access to the Ceph cluster.",
    "additional_details": [
      "The vulnerability exists in Ceph versions before 13.2.4.",
      "The issue is related to the 'max-keys' parameter for ListBucket operations in RGW.",
      "The fix involves enforcing bounds on 'max-keys', 'max-uploads', and 'max-parts' in RGW.",
      "CVSS v3 scores range from 6.5 (NVD) to 6.5 (SUSE) (high impact on Availability)",
       "SUSE information indicates a single low privileged user can cause a high impact to availabilty using a network based attack"
