Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input during the installation process of Hoosk. Specifically, the `SiteUrl` field allows for the injection of arbitrary PHP code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Code Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious PHP code directly into a configuration setting.
- **Lack of Output Encoding:** The injected code is then executed when the `config.php` file is accessed, indicating that the application doesn't properly encode or sanitize data when rendering.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This gives them significant control over the application and potentially the entire server, allowing them to perform various malicious activities, such as:
    - Data theft or modification
    - System compromise
    - Denial of service
- In the provided example, `phpinfo()` is used to demonstrate the injection, which exposes sensitive server information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the installation process.
- Specifically, the attacker needs to provide malicious PHP code within the `SiteUrl` configuration parameter during Hoosk's initial setup.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to initiate the Hoosk installation process. This means they would either need to be a user installing the system themselves, or find a way to manipulate an ongoing installation.

**Additional details:**
- The report includes screenshots of the injection being successfully performed.
- The vulnerable version is identified as V1.7.0.
