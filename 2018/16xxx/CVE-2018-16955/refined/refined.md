{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The redirection function after successful authentication varies its method depending on the URL scheme of the `in_hi_redirect` parameter. When the scheme is `https://`, the URL is reflected verbatim into a `<META>` tag.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The application reflects the `in_hi_redirect` parameter directly into a `<META>` tag within the HTML response when using `https://` scheme without proper sanitization."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious HTML and JavaScript code into the `in_hi_redirect` parameter. This code will be executed in the user's browser immediately before the redirection occurs. This can lead to arbitrary code execution within the user's browser session.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By crafting a malicious URL with the `in_hi_redirect` parameter set to include a `https://` URL followed by HTML/JavaScript code."
    ],
   "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need prior authentication. The user has to click a link with the malicious redirect or be redirected after a successful login."
