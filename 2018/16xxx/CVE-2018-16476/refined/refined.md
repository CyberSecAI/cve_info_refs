{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises from how Active Job deserializes user input using GlobalID. Specifically, when user input is directly passed to a job's `perform_later` method, Active Job attempts to deserialize it using GlobalID, which, if exploited, can allow an attacker to access information they should not have access to.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Broken Access Control",
    "Insecure Deserialization"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could gain access to information that they should not have access to. This could potentially include sensitive data or memory addresses belonging to the application, leading to further exploitation or information leakage.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through user-controlled input that is passed to the Active Job `perform_later` method. An attacker crafts this input in a way that triggers the vulnerable deserialization process using GlobalID.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to influence the input data passed to a `perform_later` call of an `ActiveJob` class. No other specific capabilities or positions are mentioned."
