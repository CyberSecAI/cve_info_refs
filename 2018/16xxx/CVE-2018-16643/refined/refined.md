Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2018-16643:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing error check after calling the `fputc` function in several image processing functions within ImageMagick. Specifically, the code does not check the return value of `fputc` to ensure that the character was written successfully to the temporary file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing error check after `fputc` in `ReadDCMImage`, `ReadPWPImage`, `ReadCALSImage`, and `ReadPICTImage` functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A failure to write to the temporary file due to `fputc` returning an error could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS). The specific consequences could range from a program crash to other unspecified effects.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By supplying a crafted image file (DCM, PWP, CALS, or PICT) that triggers the vulnerable code paths, an attacker can cause the `fputc` function to fail and crash the application or cause other unexpected behaviors.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply a malicious image file to an application using the vulnerable version of ImageMagick.
- No special access is needed, as long as the application parses the malicious image file using the affected image format decoders.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involves adding a check to verify the return value of `fputc` and handle failures to write to the temporary file accordingly.
- The github commit [6b6bff0](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/6b6bff054d569a77973f2140c0e86366e6168a6c) and issue [#1199](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/1199) on the ImageMagick repository directly relate to this vulnerability and provides more details. The related commit addresses the missing check in all of the mentioned coders.
- The Debian LTS advisory DLA-1530-1 and Ubuntu Security Notice USN-3785-1 both acknowledge and patch this vulnerability.
