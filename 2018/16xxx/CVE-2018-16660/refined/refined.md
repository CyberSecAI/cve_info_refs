  "CVE-2018-16660": {
    "related": true,
    "information": [
      {
        "type": "exploit-db",
        "content": {
          "Root cause": "The Python CGIs in the PWS component of Imperva SecureSphere v13 did not properly sanitize user-supplied command parameters, leading to command injection.",
          "Weaknesses": [
            "Command Injection",
            "Improper Input Sanitization"
          ],
          "Impact": "Remote command execution with root privileges",
          "Attack vectors": [
            "Unauthenticated remote code execution (Pre-FTL mode)",
            "Authenticated remote code execution (Gateway mode)"
          ],
            "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted POST request to the `/pws/impcli` endpoint with a malicious command embedded within the `installer-address` parameter.  \n\n1. **Unauthenticated RCE (Pre-FTL mode)**: No authentication is needed when the SecureSphere VM is provisioned without running the `ftl` utility.\n2. **Authenticated RCE (Gateway mode)**: When the SecureSphere VM is configured as a gateway using the `ftl` utility, authentication with a valid agent registration credential for the user `imperva` is required.",
          "Additional Details": "The vulnerability can be exploited through two different scenarios depending on the configuration of the SecureSphere VM. When the SecureSphere VM is provisioned without running the 'ftl' utility, the vulnerable endpoint could be reached without authentication. When SecureSphere VM is configured as gateway mode via 'ftl' utility, the vulnerable endpoint could be reached with valid agent registration credential for user 'imperva'. The provided exploit code uses a base64-encoded command injected into the `installer-address` parameter to achieve code execution."
