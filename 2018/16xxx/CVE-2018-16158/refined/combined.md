# Eaton Xpert Meter SSH Private Key Exposure

## 1. Description

Eaton Power Xpert Meters are used across industries for energy management,

monitoring circuit loading, and identifying power quality problems.

Meters running firmware 12.x.x.x or below version 13.3.x.x and below ship with

a public/private key pair on Power Xpert Meter hardware that allows

passwordless authentication to any other affected Power Xpert Meter.

The vendor recommends updating to Version 13.4.0.10 or above. As the key is

easily retrievable, an attacker can use it to gain unauthorized remote

access as uid0

Using the private key distributed with the meters has been tested across multiple Power Xpert Meters to successfully authenticate as any user account created on the devices due to profile configurations.

ssh -m hmac-sha1 -c aes128-cbc -o KexAlgorithms=diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 -o HostKeyAlgorithms=ssh-rsa -i ./id\_rsa admin@hostname

Once logged into the device, there are a myriad of issues ranging from hashes being stored in /etc/passwd file permissions, exploitable services, weak crypto algorithms etc.

## 3. Solution:

A new version of this firmware already exists for meters with firmware versions 13.x and above. Eaton recommends all customers using the products above to install the newest firmware. Please download the latest firmware (Version 13.4.0.10) from the product portal.

In the future, as new firmware is made available for the Power Xpert Meter 4000/6000/8000, Eaton recommends that customers upgrade to the latest available release of firmware.

Power Xpert Meters 4000/6000/8000 with firmware version 12 and below were manufactured before September 2010 and are considered an end-of-life hardware platform. These older meters should be replaced with new Power Xpert Meters 4000/6000/8000.

## 4. Timeline:

\* 07-16-2018: Discovered and validated

\* 07-17-2018: Metasploit module generated for simple scanning and testing

\* 07-18-2018: Vendor Notified via CybersecurityCoE@eaton.com at 1:06PM Eastern time

\* 07-19-2018: Vendor initial response recognizing the submission 8:08AM Eastern time

\* 07-20-2018: Submitted information to Cert.org

\* 07-20-2018: Cert/CC declined involvement as long as Eaton was responding.

\* 07-25-2018: Vendor responds with "If you upgrade to the latest version, you should not see them anymore."

\* 07-25-2018: Question sent to Vendor - "As the issue has already been resolved is there any request for a wait period prior to publishing public vulnerability checks to allow other organizations to scan for this issue?"

\* 07-25-2018: Vendor response - "Give us a few days. We are, in parallel, working on a communication for our customers too. As soon as we publish it, you could go ahead and release the information also. I will come back to you very soon."

\* 08-08-2018: Update request sent to vendor - "Has an acceptable release date been set?

Is it known which products and firmware versions are impacted to allow for accurate remediation information to be provided?"

\* 08-13-2018: Vendor response - "We are preparing an advisory. This is very old firmware (2010) and hence the delay. I should be able to come back to you in 10 days once the advisory is formalized. You should then be able to release the information. I hope this is OK."

\* 08-13-2018: Confirmation sent to vendor that the wait time has been accepted.

\* 08-28-2018: "We have now put up an advisory from our end: http://www.eaton.com/content/dam/eaton/company/news-insights/cybersecurity/security-bulletins/PXM-Advisory.pdf . You can go ahead and publish the vulnerabilities. Firmware version 13.x and above are upgradable. Unfortunately, version 12.x and below are end-of-life and can not be upgraded."

\* 08-29-2018: Submitted to MITRE for a CVE 9:23pm, CVE-2018-16158 assigned within 3 hours.

Advisory on Power Xpert Meter 4000/6000/8000

Medium

Power Xpert Meter 4000/6000/8000, firmware versions 13.3 and below

Eaton has identified potential vulnerabilities
in older versions of Power Xpert Meter
firmware (Version 13.3 and below). These
meters are used across industries for energy
management, monitoring circuit loading,
and identifying power quality problems.

Cybersecurity standards and best practices

Eaton recommends that users of the
affected products follow the
recommendations outlined in Eaton’s
Cybersecurity Considerations for Electrical
Distribution Systems whitepaper at the link
here.

Recommended course of action

Support

For additional information or a list of
vulnerabilities that have been reported on
our products and how to address them,
please visit our Cybersecurity website
www.eaton.com/cybersecurity or you can
contact us at
CybersecurityCOE@eaton.com.

A new version of this firmware already
exists for meters with firmware versions
13.x and above. Eaton recommends all
customers using the products above to
install the new firmware. Please download
the latest firmware (Version 13.4.0.10) from
our portal.

In the future, as new firmware is made
available for the Power Xpert Meter
4000/6000/8000, Eaton recommends that
customers upgrade to the latest available
release of firmware.

Power Xpert Meters 4000/6000/8000 with
firmware version 12 and below were
manufactured before September 2010 and
are considered an end-of-life hardware
platform. These older meters should be
replaced with new Power Xpert Meters
4000/6000/8000.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
