    "source": "blog.zimperium.com_f3bbaef8_20250125_160224.html",
    "details": "The function prvProcessICMPPacket doesnâ€™t validate that the received frame is large enough to be an ICMP packet, and can access fields from this packet out of bounds.\n\nThe attacker can leak information by observing the response to a truncated ICMP echo request.",
    "Root cause": "Lack of input validation on the received ICMP packet size within `prvProcessICMPPacket`.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper bounds check",
        "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact": "Information leak.",
    "Attack vector": "Sending a crafted ICMP packet with a truncated size.",
    "Required capabilities": "Attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the vulnerable device."
