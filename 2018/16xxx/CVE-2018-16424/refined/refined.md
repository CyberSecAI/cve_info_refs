{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient bounds checking and improper handling of data received from smart cards, leading to various types of memory corruption issues.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds write (heap and stack)",
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Double free",
      "Off-by-one write",
      "Unbounded recursion"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (application crash) and potentially other unspecified impacts such as arbitrary code execution.",
     "attack_vectors": "Malicious smart cards sending crafted responses to APDU commands.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply crafted smart cards to the vulnerable system."
  },
    "additional_details": {
    "OOB_write_muscle_list_files": "In function `muscle_list_files()`, an out-of-bounds write might occur because `bufLen` is not checked before writing file OIDs into the buffer.",
    "OOB_write_tcos_select_file": "In function `tcos_select_file()`, a filename extracted from an APDU response is written into the `file->name` variable without checking if the retrieved string fits into the buffer, leading to a potential out-of-bounds write.",
    "OOB_write_piv_validate_general_authentication": "In function `piv_validate_general_authentication()`, if `datalen` is greater than 4096, an out-of-bounds write occurs, although no current caller does this.",
    "OOB_write_gemsafe_get_cert_len": "The function `gemsafe_get_cert_len()` might write beyond the `gemsafe_prkeys` and `gemsafe_cert` arrays if more than 12 containers are stored on the card.",
    "OOB_write_util_acl_to_str": "In function `util_acl_to_str()`, no checks are performed to ensure the constructed string fits into the `line` buffer, leading to a potential out-of-bounds write.",
    "OOB_write_read_public_key_private_key": "In functions `read_public_key()` and `read_private_key()`, the `bufsize` variable is overwritten with `file->size` retrieved from the smartcard, which could be larger than the allocated buffer of 2048 bytes, resulting in a stack-based buffer overflow when calling `sc_read_binary()`.",
    "OOB_write_decrypt_response": "In function `decrypt_response()`, an out-of-bounds overwrite can occur if the `plaintext` buffer does not fit into the `out` buffer before copying.",
    "OOB_write_cac_get_serial_nr_from_CUID": "In function `cac_get_serial_nr_from_CUID()`, the serial number is copied into `serial->value` using the length of the source instead of the destination, leading to a potential out-of-bounds write.",
        "off_by_one_sc_pkcs15emu_esteid_init": "In function `sc_pkcs15emu_esteid_init()`, an off-by-one write with a `\\x00` occurs if `sc_read_record()` returns `sizeof(buf)` bytes.",
    "double_free_sc_file_set_sec_attr": "In function `sc_file_set_sec_attr()`, a double free occurs when `sec_attr_len` is 0, as `realloc()` will free `file->sec_attr`, and the error handling path will attempt to free it again.",
   "double_free_read_file": "In function `read_file()`, a double free can be triggered if two calls to `sc_select_file()` return a `file->size` of zero, as the memory is freed twice.",
    "double_free_sc_pkcs15emu_sc_hsm_init": "In function `sc_pkcs15emu_sc_hsm_init()`, a double free can occur because the function can be called twice, with the second call freeing already freed memory.",
    "unbound_recursion_iasecc_select_mf_file": "The functions `iasecc_select_file()` and `iasecc_select_mf()` call each other recursively, which can lead to an infinite recursion and stack exhaustion."
