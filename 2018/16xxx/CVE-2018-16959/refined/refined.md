The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in Oracle WebCenter Interaction 10.3.3, including CVE-2018-16959.

**CVE-2018-16959**

*   **Root Cause:** Insecure default configuration of the "User Profile" community within Oracle WebCenter Interaction.
*   **Weakness:** The "Everyone" group is granted read access to user profile information by default, exposing usernames.
*  **Impact:** Unauthenticated users can enumerate valid usernames, which can then be used in brute-force or password-spraying attacks to gain unauthorized access to the portal. This is exacerbated when Active Directory is used as an authentication source.
*   **Attack Vector:** Attacker can access the user profile community using numerical identifiers and incrementing them, such as `/portal/server.pt/user/user/[ID]`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**  No special capabilities or privileges are required. An attacker can be unauthenticated and perform this attack over the network if the Oracle WebCenter Interaction instance is accessible.
