[monstra\_3.0.4\_IDOR.pdf](https://github.com/monstra-cms/monstra/files/2355702/monstra_3.0.4_IDOR.pdf)

Vulnerable URL: '<http://localhost/monstra/monstra-dev/admin/index.php?id=users&action=edit&user_id=2>'

Hello sir,

I have found a Insecure Direct Object Reference vulnerability in Monstra 3.0.4 in the vulnerable URL page. Here I was able to change the password of an administrator user while being authenticated a user with "Editor" role by changing the 'user\_id' parameter to that of the target user. I have prepared and attached a doc with details of the vulnerability and steps to reproduce.
