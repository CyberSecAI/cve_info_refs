Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described under CVE-2018-16146:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper sanitization of the 'value' parameter within the notification testing functionality of the Opsview Web Management console.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: The lack of proper input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the 'value' parameter, which are then executed by the system.
- The vulnerability is located within the notification testing functionality which is accessible by authenticated administrators.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Command Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the 'nagios' user.
- Full system compromise via chained exploitation: By combining this vulnerability with a reflected XSS vulnerability, an attacker could trick an admin into clicking a crafted link, and then exploit the command injection to achieve a reverse shell.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/rest/config/notificationmethod/testnotification` endpoint with a crafted JSON payload. The 'value' parameter within the "test_variables" array is used to inject commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authentication: The attacker needs to be an authenticated administrator within the Opsview Web Management Console to access the notification testing functionality.
- Network Access: The attacker needs to have network access to the Opsview instance in order to send the malicious HTTP request.
- Chained exploit requires the ability to get an admin user to visit a crafted URL containing malicious javascript.
