Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-16348 (based on the file name, though not explicitly mentioned in the content).

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization within the "site name" parameter of the `admin_video.php` file in SeaCMS v6.61. The application fails to properly neutralize or encode user-supplied input, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Specifically, this is a stored XSS vulnerability because the malicious script is saved in the database and executed when the affected page is viewed.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not sanitize user-supplied input before storing it and rendering it back to the user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they access the affected page.
- **Session Hijacking:** By executing Javascript, the attacker could steal cookies, which can lead to session hijacking.
- **Information Theft:** Sensitive information, like user data or cookies, can be stolen.
- **Malicious Redirects:** An attacker can redirect users to malicious sites.
- **Website Defacement:** The appearance or behavior of the website can be altered.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack involves sending a crafted POST request to `admin_video.php?action=save&acttype=add`.
- **Malicious Payload:** The malicious JavaScript code is embedded within the `v_content` parameter, disguised within code tags, and using String.fromCharCode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrative access:** The attacker needs to have access to the administrative panel of the SeaCMS system to submit the crafted POST request.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit uses an `ontoggle` event within the `<details>` tag to execute the javascript when the details tag is opened
- The provided POST request shows how the attacker injects malicious JavaScript code within the  `v_content` parameter.
- The JavaScript code `eval(String.fromCharCode(97)+String.fromCharCode(108)+String.fromCharCode(101)+String.fromCharCode(114)+String.fromCharCode(116)+String.fromCharCode(40)+String.fromCharCode(100)+String.fromCharCode(111)+String.fromCharCode(99)+String.fromCharCode(117)+String.fromCharCode(109)+String.fromCharCode(101)+String.fromCharCode(110)+String.fromCharCode(116)+String.fromCharCode(46)+String.fromCharCode(99)+String.fromCharCode(111)+String.fromCharCode(111)+String.fromCharCode(107)+String.fromCharCode(105)+String.fromCharCode(101)+String.fromCharCode(41))` decodes to `alert(document.cookie)`.
