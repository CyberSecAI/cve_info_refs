Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities found in Monstra CMS V3.0.4, as described in the GitHub issue:

**Vulnerability 1: Sensitive Information Leakage**

*   **Root Cause:** The `exception.php` file in the error handling mechanism displays sensitive system information when an error occurs.
*   **Weakness:** Insecure error handling leading to information disclosure.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive server information, including:
    *   Full system PATH environment variable
    *   System root directory
    *   Command interpreter path
    *   Path extensions
    *   Server software and version
    *   Server IP address and port
    *   Document root
    *   Server admin email
    *   Script filename
*   **Attack Vector:** Direct HTTP request to the vulnerable `exception.php` file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to send a request to the server where Monstra CMS is installed.

**Vulnerability 2: HTTP Header Injection**

*   **Root Cause:** The `cryptographp.php` script does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `cfg` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject new lines and additional HTTP headers.
*   **Weakness:** Improper input validation and sanitization.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can inject malicious headers, potentially leading to:
    *   Session manipulation by setting cookies
    *   Cache poisoning
    *   Cross-site scripting (XSS) if the injected header influences content
*   **Attack Vector:** HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `cryptographp.php` file with a crafted `cfg` parameter containing newline characters (`%0D%0A`) and malicious header information.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to send a request to the server where Monstra CMS is installed.

**Vulnerability 3: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** The registration form does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `password` field, leading to reflected XSS.
*  **Weakness:** Insufficient input sanitization/output encoding.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Malware distribution
    *   Defacement
*   **Attack Vector:** HTTP POST request to the registration page with a crafted `password` field containing a JavaScript payload within HTML tags.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the registration page of the Monstra CMS instance.
