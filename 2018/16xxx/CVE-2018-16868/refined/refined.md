  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2018-16868",
    "description": "A Bleichenbacher type side-channel based padding oracle attack was found in the way gnutls handles verification of RSA decrypted PKCS#1 v1.5 data. An attacker who is able to run process on the same physical core as the victim process, could use this to extract plaintext or in some cases downgrade any TLS connections to a vulnerable server.",
    "affected_components": [
      "gnutls",
        "libgnutls"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a Bleichenbacher-like side-channel leakage in the PKCS#1 v1.5 verification and padding oracle verification within GnuTLS.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Side-channel leakage",
       "Padding oracle vulnerability",
      "Timing and memory access patterns",
       "Microarchitectural side channels"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can extract plaintext, including the pre-master secret, or potentially downgrade TLS connections on vulnerable servers.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack is performed through microarchitectural side channels, specifically cache-like attacks (CATs).",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to run a process on the same physical core as the victim process to exploit the cache side channels and have the ability to send chosen ciphertexts to the server.  Also, multiple TLS servers sharing the same certificate make the attack faster by parallelization."
