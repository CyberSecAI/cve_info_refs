Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2018-16335:

**Root Cause:** Heap-buffer-overflow in the `tiff2pdf` tool, which is part of the libtiff library. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs within the `ChopUpSingleUncompressedStrip` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Heap-based buffer overflow.
*   The overflow happens during the processing of TIFF image files when converting them to PDF using `tiff2pdf`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The crash reports suggest that the overflow leads to a segmentation fault, causing the `tiff2pdf` tool to crash.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, heap-based buffer overflows can potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution if carefully crafted. The Debian Security Advisory mentions "execution of arbitrary code if malformed image files are processed."

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious TIFF File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted, malicious TIFF image file using the `tiff2pdf` tool.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to supply crafted input:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious TIFF file to the `tiff2pdf` tool. This could be done through various means, including:
    *   Tricking a user into processing the file.
    *   Providing the file through a web server or service that uses `tiff2pdf`.

**Additional Details:**
*   The bug report mentions AddressSanitizer (ASAN) output, which clearly shows a heap-buffer-overflow during a write operation of size 8 at a specific address.
*   The vulnerability was reported against libtiff version 4.0.9 on a 32-bit Ubuntu system.
*   The fix for CVE-2017-11613, and commits 3719385a3fac5cfb20b487619a5f08abbf967cf8 and 7a092f8af2568d61993a8cc2e7a35a998d7d37be are mentioned as potential fixes.
*   The Debian security advisory DSA-4349-1 lists this CVE as part of a larger set of security fixes for libtiff, and states that this issue has been fixed in version 4.0.8-2+deb9u4 for the "stretch" distribution.

**Summary:**
CVE-2018-16335 is a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability in the `tiff2pdf` tool within the libtiff library. It can be triggered by processing a specially crafted TIFF image file and could lead to a denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution.
