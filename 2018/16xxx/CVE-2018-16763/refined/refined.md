CVE-2018-16763:
The provided content describes an exploit for CVE-2018-16763 in FUEL CMS version 1.4.1. The vulnerability is a code evaluation vulnerability that allows for remote code execution.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to insecure use of user-supplied input within the `filter` parameter in `/fuel/pages/select/`. The application directly evaluates the user-provided input, allowing for arbitrary PHP code execution.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Code evaluation: The application evaluates user-supplied input as PHP code without proper sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
  - Remote Code Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, leading to full compromise of the application and server.
- **Attack vectors**:
  - HTTP GET request to `/fuel/pages/select/` with a malicious payload in the `filter` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
  - No authentication is required, as the vulnerability is pre-authentication.
