- **Root cause of vulnerability**: When renaming a namespace in GitLab with Geo enabled, if hashed storage is not enabled, project files of subgroups are not moved properly on the secondary Geo instance.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect handling of file paths during namespace renaming in a Geo setup without hashed storage. This leads to orphaned files.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  The repository, wiki, and uploads will be inaccessible or "missing" on the secondary Geo instance. This results in data inconsistency between primary and secondary Geo instances.
- **Attack vectors**: Renaming a namespace containing subgroups in a GitLab instance with Geo enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker with the ability to rename namespaces in a GitLab instance with Geo enabled. Hashed storage must be disabled for the vulnerability to be triggered.
