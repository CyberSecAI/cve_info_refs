Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-16529:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the password reset mechanism of Forcepoint Secure Messaging (specifically Forcepoint Email Security version 8.5.x). Although the system disables the password reset form after a link's expiration or previous use, this client-side disabling is not properly enforced on the server-side.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Client-side validation bypass:** The primary weakness is that the password reset link expiration and usage validation are only enforced by disabling form elements on the client-side (within the page's DOM).
*   **Lack of server-side validation:** The server fails to properly validate that the password reset link is still valid before allowing the password reset to proceed.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized password reset:** An attacker who obtains a password reset link, even if it is expired or has already been used, can manipulate the client-side DOM to re-enable the password reset form. Subsequently, they can reset the user's password and gain access to their account.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Password reset link interception/reuse:** The attacker needs to obtain a password reset link intended for a specific user, either by intercepting the email containing the link or by simply obtaining a used or expired link.
*   **Client-side manipulation:** The attacker must be able to modify the webpage's DOM (typically through browser developer tools or similar means) to re-enable the disabled password reset form elements.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs access to the password reset link (expired or valid).
*   The attacker must be able to modify the HTML DOM in the victim's browser to re-enable the password reset input field and button.
*   The attacker does not require any access to the server infrastructure or direct access to the target's system besides obtaining the reset link.

**Additional notes:**
* The vulnerability was present in version 8.5.x of Forcepoint Email Security
* The issue was fixed with hotfix 002 for versions 8.5.0 and 8.5.3
