  "CVE-2018-16601": {
    "description": "The function prvProcessIPPacket removes the IP options field of an Rx packet if it is present. The size of the IP header is not validated at any point. If an attacker supplies an IP header length field (uxHeaderLength) thatâ€™s larger than the whole packet (pxNetworkBuffer->xDataLength) minus ipSIZE_OF_IPv4_HEADER (20), the computation of xMoveLen will cause an integer underflow. This will cause memmove to move a huge chunk of data, covering the entire 32 bit memory area.",
    "root_cause": "Lack of proper validation of IP header length when processing IP options.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer underflow",
      "Incorrect memory manipulation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a DoS. In some cases, an attacker can achieve remote code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "Sending a crafted IP packet with an invalid IP header length that triggers an integer underflow.",
      "required_capabilities": "Attacker must be able to send network packets to the vulnerable device."
