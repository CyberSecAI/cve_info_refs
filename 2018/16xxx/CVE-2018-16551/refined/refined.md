- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input when setting the job title, leading to the storage of a malicious script in the database.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browser of any user who views the affected page. This could be used for session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker injects the malicious script into the job title field when editing a job post, which is stored in the database. The script is then executed when the job listing is displayed on another page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to edit job titles. They must be a user with sufficient privileges to access the editing page.
