```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A heap-buffer-overflow occurs during the parsing of a WASM file, specifically within the `IR::FunctionValidationContext::catch_all(IR::NoImm)` function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability due to improper bounds checking during WASM file parsing.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability leads to a crash due to memory corruption, as detected by AddressSanitizer. An attacker may potentially use this to execute arbitrary code, but this is not detailed in the report.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a maliciously crafted WASM file that triggers the heap-buffer-overflow during parsing by the vulnerable `wavm` application.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted WASM file to the `wavm` application to trigger the vulnerability. This could occur through a variety of means, for example, by tricking the user to open a malicious WASM file, or if the WASM file is being fetched through a web service and an attacker compromises that web service."
