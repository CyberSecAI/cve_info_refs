Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `body` parameter within the Nucleus CMS application. Specifically, HTML code is not encoded or escaped when processing the input from the `itemedit` action, which is later displayed in the output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **HTML Injection:** The application allows users to inject arbitrary HTML code through the `body` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Cookie Disclosure:** An attacker could inject malicious HTML code (e.g., JavaScript) that steals session cookies, allowing them to impersonate victims.
*   **Page Content Modification:** The attacker can modify the content of the vulnerable web page seen by the victims, potentially for phishing or other malicious purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Input via URL Parameter:** The attacker injects HTML code into the `body` parameter of the URL used for editing items (`index.php?action=itemedit&itemid=8`). This crafted payload is stored by the application.
*   **Display via Item View URL:** The injected code is then executed when the corresponding item is viewed (`/?itemid=8`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Nucleus CMS with permissions to edit items.

**Summary of PoC:**
1. Login to Nucleus CMS.
2. Navigate to the item edit page (e.g., `index.php?action=itemedit&itemid=8`).
3. Inject malicious HTML into the 'body' parameter.
4. Navigate to the item view page (e.g., `/?itemid=8`) to see the injected HTML is executed.
