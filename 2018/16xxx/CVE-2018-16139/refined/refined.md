- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application reflects user-supplied input in the URL parameters `start` and `search` without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the webpage. This could lead to:
    - Stealing authentication tokens/cookies
    - Injecting keyloggers
    - Exploiting browser vulnerabilities for Remote Code Execution (RCE)
    - Impersonating users, including administrators, to escalate privileges
    - Gaining access to other applications through single sign-on if the stolen authentication tokens are valid for other systems
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious URL with JavaScript code injected into the vulnerable parameters `start` or `search` and tricks a user into visiting the link or browsing the affected page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs and convince a user to access them, typically through social engineering or other means. No specific privileged access is required.
