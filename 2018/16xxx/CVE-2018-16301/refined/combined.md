One of the effects of commit [faf8fb7](https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/tcpdump/commit/faf8fb70af3a013e5d662b8283dec742fd6b1a77) was fixing a buffer overflow that
was discovered and reported by Include Security (case reference "F2").
Their work was sponsored by Mozilla under the Secure Open Source
program.  The vulnerability was assigned [CVE-2018-16301](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h8wh-rj39-x373 "CVE-2018-16301") on 2018-09-01
(MITRE request reference "scr562827"), but was not properly documented
afterwards.  Add a line to the change log section for 4.99.0, which at
the time of this writing is the first release to incorporate the fix.
