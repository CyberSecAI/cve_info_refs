  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-2018-16602": {
      "root_cause": "The `prvProcessDHCPReplies` function in FreeRTOS's TCP/IP stack does not properly validate the size of DHCP packets and their option fields.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient bounds checking when processing DHCP packets.",
        "Lack of validation on DHCP option lengths leading to out-of-bounds reads."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can leak information from the device's memory by observing out-of-bounds reads in DHCP option fields.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending crafted DHCP responses to a vulnerable device."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device and capable of sending DHCP packets."
