# Vulnerability Summary for the Week of September 3, 2018

 Released Sep 10, 2018

Document IDSB18-253

The CISA Vulnerability Bulletin provides a summary of new vulnerabilities that have been recorded in the past week. In some cases, the vulnerabilities in the bulletin may not yet have assigned CVSS scores.

Vulnerabilities are based on the [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/) (CVE) vulnerability naming standard and are organized according to severity, determined by the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm) (CVSS) standard. The division of high, medium, and low severities correspond to the following scores:

* **High**: vulnerabilities with a CVSS base score of 7.0–10.0
* **Medium**: vulnerabilities with a CVSS base score of 4.0–6.9
* **Low**: vulnerabilities with a CVSS base score of 0.0–3.9

Entries may include additional information provided by organizations and efforts sponsored by CISA. This information may include identifying information, values, definitions, and related links. Patch information is provided when available. Please note that some of the information in the bulletin is compiled from external, open-source reports and is not a direct result of CISA analysis.

**Vulnerability Severity:**
[High Vulnerabilities](#high_v)
[Medium Vulnerabilities](#medium_v)
[Low Vulnerabilities](#low_v)
[Not Yet Assigned](#snya_v_title)

---

The NCCIC Weekly Vulnerability Summary Bulletin is created using information from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search) (NVD). In some cases, the vulnerabilities in the Bulletin may not yet have assigned CVSS scores. Please visit NVD for updated vulnerability entries, which include CVSS scores once they are available.

| absolute\_software -- ctes\_windows\_agent | An issue was discovered in Absolute Software CTES Windows Agent through 1.0.0.1479. The security permissions on the %ProgramData%\CTES folder and sub-folders may allow write access to low-privileged user accounts. This allows unauthorized replacement of service program executable (EXE) or dynamically loadable library (DLL) files, causing elevated (SYSTEM) user access. Configuration control files or data files under this folder could also be similarly modified to affect service process behavior. | 2018-09-08 | not yet calculated | [CVE-2018-16715](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2018-16715)[CONFIRM](https://community.absolute.com/s/article/Absolute-Security-Bulletin-ASB1) |
| adobe -- experience\_manager | Adobe Experience Manager versions 6.4, 6.3, 6.2, 6.1, and 6.0 have a Cross-site Scripting vulnerability.

| curl -- curl | curl before version 7.61.1 is vulnerable to a buffer overrun in the NTLM authentication code. The internal function Curl\_ntlm\_core\_mk\_nt\_hash multiplies the length of the password by two (SUM) to figure out how large temporary storage area to allocate from the heap. The length value is then subsequently used to iterate over the password and generate output into the allocated storage buffer. On systems with a 32 bit size\_t, the math to calculate SUM triggers an integer overflow when the password length exceeds 2GB (2^31 bytes). This integer overflow usually causes a very small buffer to actually get allocated instead of the intended very huge one, making the use of that buffer end up in a heap buffer overflow.
