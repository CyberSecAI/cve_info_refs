  "CVE-2018-16850": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2018-16850",
      "Description": "It was discovered that PostgreSQL incorrectly handled certain trigger definitions when running pg_upgrade or pg_dump. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary SQL statements with superuser privileges."
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause": "PostgreSQL versions before 11.1 and 10.6 improperly handle trigger definitions with transition relations names, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities during pg_upgrade or pg_dump operations.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "SQL Injection"
      ],
      "Impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL statements with superuser privileges.",
      "Attack vector": "A remote attacker with `CREATE` privilege on a non-temporary schema, or `TRIGGER` privilege on some table, can create a malicious trigger definition. When `pg_upgrade` or `pg_dump` is used on the database, the crafted trigger results in arbitrary SQL statements being executed with superuser privileges during the restore process.",
        "Required capabilities": "The attacker requires `CREATE` privilege on some non-temporary schema or `TRIGGER` privilege on some table. By default in PostgreSQL, all users have `CREATE` permissions on the 'public' schema."
    }
