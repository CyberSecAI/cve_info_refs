The content is related to CVE-2018-16303.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The PDF-XChange Editor parses the "x:xmpmeta" XML structure within a PDF document, including processing any defined DOCTYPE and ENTITY declarations. This behavior allows for XML External Entity (XXE) injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software is vulnerable to XXE injection due to its improper handling of XML parsing, specifically when processing external entities defined within the PDF's metadata.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can craft a malicious PDF file that, when opened (or even previewed in Windows Explorer) by a user, could trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. This is achieved via a "Billion Laughs" attack using a recursive entity definition, causing the application to enter a loop that can take considerable time to complete, effectively hanging the application. The application may hang for a very long period of time, potentially indefinitely.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a specially crafted PDF file containing malicious XML in the "x:xmpmeta" field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious PDF file and entice the victim to open or preview it using the vulnerable software. No special network position is required.
