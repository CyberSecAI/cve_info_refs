{
  "CVE-2018-16886": {
    "Description": "Etcd, versions 3.2.0 through 3.2.25 and 3.3.0 through 3.3.10, are vulnerable to an improper authentication issue when role-based access control (RBAC) is used and client-cert-auth is enabled. If an etcd client server's TLS certificate contains a Common Name (CN) which matches a valid RBAC username, a remote attacker may authenticate as that user with any valid (trusted) client certificate in a REST API request to the gRPC-gateway.",
    "Root cause": "The gRPC-gateway was using the client certificate's Common Name (CN) for authentication when RBAC was enabled and client-cert-auth was in use, instead of verifying the user's credentials correctly. This allowed an attacker to impersonate a user if their client certificate had a CN that matched a valid RBAC username.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper Authentication",
       "Use of an insecure value for authentication"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker, with any valid (trusted) client certificate, can authenticate as another user if the certificate's CN matches a valid RBAC username, leading to unauthorized access and potential privilege escalation.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a REST API request to the gRPC-gateway of an etcd server. The attacker needs to be able to make network requests to the etcd gRPC-gateway.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have access to a trusted client certificate and be able to send requests to the etcd gRPC-gateway. They must also know a valid RBAC username that can be matched with a CN of a client certificate to impersonate a user."
