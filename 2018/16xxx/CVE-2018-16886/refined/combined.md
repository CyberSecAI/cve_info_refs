If an etcd client server's TLS certificate contains a Common Name (CN) which matches a valid RBAC username, a remote attacker may authenticate as that user with any valid (trusted) client certificate in a REST API request to the gRPC-gateway.  Introduced in commit: <https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/commit/0191509637546621d6f2e18e074e955ab8ef374d>  Upstream issue: <https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/10366>  Upstream patch: <https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/commit/bf9d0d8291dc71ecbfb2690612954e1a298154b2> <https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/commit/a9a9466fb8ba11ad7bb6a44d7446fbd072d59887> <https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/commit/99704e2a97e8710da942bdc737417fc9c9a2c03f> <https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/commit/83c051b701d33261eef91a719e4421c81b000ba4>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1651034#c3)  Sam Batschelet    2018-11-27 13:11:40 UTC  ``` From my review, this issue is not reproducible.

As far as scope this also affects all etcd 3.2.x and 3.3.x that is using --client-cert-auth.

FTR this issue does not require grpc-proxy.  If etcd is using RBAC and `--client-cert-auth` is enabled. Make sure that the client server certificate `--cert-file` does not include a common name. IF a common name is part of this certificate consider removing. If removal is not possible understand that a RBAC user with username = to CN can be exploited by any REST request to the gRPC-gateway. Essentially the username in the CA will always be used during authentication.   openssl x509 -noout -subject -in client.pem | grep -o 'CN.*'  example curl --key $key --cert $cert --cacert $ca -L <https://localhost:2379/v3beta/kv/put> \   -X POST -d '{"key": "Zm9v", "value": "YmFy"}'   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1651034#c24)  Jan Chaloupka    2019-01-11 15:41:05 UTC  ``` Sam,  checking the etcd release [1] I still don't see any new update.

I should know more today, I am sorry this process takes so long but we (etcd) currently are dependent on 2 specific maintainers to cut an etcd release. I am trying to get involved in this process to improve this turn around.   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1651034#c28)  Sam Batschelet    2019-01-11 22:06:06 UTC  ``` <https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases>  v3.3.11 and v3.3.26 are now live.   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=1651034#c30)  Paul Harvey    2019-01-14 00:27:59 UTC  ``` Re-worded flaw description according to common 23, thanks Sam.

To check the CN field of a certificate:   openssl x509 -noout -subject -in /path/to/client.crt | grep -o 'CN.*'  To check if there is a username matching the CN field in the TLS client certificate:   etcdctl user get <TLS client certificate CN>  For more information on TLS authentication features including how client-cert-auth is enabled, refer to the etcd transport security model documentation: <https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/security.md> For more information on Role-based access control including how it is enabled, refer to the etcd role-based access control documentation: <https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/authentication.md>   ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=1651034#c35)  Paul Harvey    2019-01-14 01:04:09 UTC  ``` <https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/1eee465a43720d713bb69f7b7f5e120135fdb1ac/CHANGELOG-3.3.md#security-authentication> <https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/1eee465a43720d713bb69f7b7f5e120135fdb1ac/CHANGELOG-3.2.md#security-authentication>   ```  [Comment 37](show_bug.cgi?id=1651034#c37)  Paul Harvey    2019-01-14 01:55:01 UTC  ``` Created etcd tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1665782](show_bug.cgi?id=1665782 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-16886 etcd: Improper Authentication in auth/store.go:AuthInfoFromTLS() via gRPC-gateway [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 38](show_bug.cgi?id=1651034#c38)  Paul Harvey    2019-01-14 03:36:40 UTC  ``` This isn't really an auth bypass; the mutual TLS authentication is still working, it's more that our REST endpoint is makeing an auth decision based on irrelevant data.

Previous change logs can be found at [CHANGELOG-3.1](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/CHANGELOG-3.1.md).

The [minimum recommended etcd versions to run in **production**](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/etcd-dev/nZQl17RjxHQ/FkC_rZ_4AwAJT) is 3.1.11+, 3.2.26+, and 3.3.11+.

---

## [v3.2.27](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.2.27) (2019-TBD)

---

## [v3.2.26](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.2.26) (2019-1-11)

See [code changes](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/compare/v3.2.25...v3.2.26) and [v3.2 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_3.md) for any breaking changes. **Again, before running upgrades from any previous release, please make sure to read change logs below and [v3.2 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_2.md).**

### gRPC Proxy

* Fix [memory leak in cache layer](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/10327).

### Security, Authentication

* Disable [CommonName authentication for gRPC-gateway](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/10366) gRPC-gateway proxy requests to etcd server use the etcd client server TLS certificate. If that certificate contains CommonName we do not want to use that for authentication as it could lead to permission escalation.

### Go

* Compile with [*Go 1.8.7*](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#go1.8).

---

## [v3.2.25](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.2.25) (2018-10-10)

See [code changes](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/compare/v3.2.24...v3.2.25) and [v3.2 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_2.md) for any breaking changes. **Again, before running upgrades from any previous release, please make sure to read change logs below and [v3.2 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_2.md).**

### Improved

* Improve ["became inactive" warning log](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/10024), which indicates message send to a peer failed.
* Improve [read index wait timeout warning log](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/10026), which indicates that local node might have slow network.
* Add [gRPC interceptor for debugging logs](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9990); enable `etcd --debug` flag to see per-request debug information.
* Add [consistency check in snapshot status](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/10109). If consistency check on snapshot file fails, `snapshot status` returns `"snapshot file integrity check failed..."` error.

### Metrics, Monitoring

See [List of metrics](https://etcd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operate.html#v3-2) for all metrics per release.

Note that any `etcd_debugging_*` metrics are experimental and subject to change.

* Improve [`etcd_network_peer_round_trip_time_seconds`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/10155) Prometheus metric to track leader heartbeats.
  + Previously, it only samples the TCP connection for snapshot messages.
* Display all registered [gRPC metrics at start](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/10032).
* Add [`etcd_snap_db_fsync_duration_seconds_count`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9997) Prometheus metric.

### client v3

* Fix logic on [release lock key if cancelled](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/10153) in `clientv3/concurrency` package.

### Go

* Compile with [*Go 1.8.7*](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#go1.8).

---

* Add [`etcd_server_heartbeat_send_failures_total`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9942) Prometheus metric.
* Add [`etcd_server_slow_apply_total`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9942) Prometheus metric.
* Add [`etcd_disk_backend_defrag_duration_seconds`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9942) Prometheus metric.
* Add [`etcd_mvcc_hash_duration_seconds`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9942) Prometheus metric.
* Add [`etcd_server_slow_read_indexes_total`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9897) Prometheus metric.
* Add [`etcd_server_quota_backend_bytes`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9820) Prometheus metric.
  + Use it with `etcd_mvcc_db_total_size_in_bytes` and `etcd_mvcc_db_total_size_in_use_in_bytes`.
  + `etcd_server_quota_backend_bytes 2.147483648e+09` means current quota size is 2 GB.
  + `etcd_mvcc_db_total_size_in_bytes 20480` means current physically allocated DB size is 20 KB.
  + `etcd_mvcc_db_total_size_in_use_in_bytes 16384` means future DB size if defragment operation is complete.
  + `etcd_mvcc_db_total_size_in_bytes - etcd_mvcc_db_total_size_in_use_in_bytes` is the number of bytes that can be saved on disk with defragment operation.
* Add [`etcd_mvcc_db_total_size_in_bytes`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9819) Prometheus metric.
  + In addition to [`etcd_debugging_mvcc_db_total_size_in_bytes`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9819).
* Add [`etcd_mvcc_db_total_size_in_use_in_bytes`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9256) Prometheus metric.
  + Use it with `etcd_mvcc_db_total_size_in_bytes` and `etcd_server_quota_backend_bytes`.
  + `etcd_server_quota_backend_bytes 2.147483648e+09` means current quota size is 2 GB.

### gRPC Proxy

* Add [flags for specifying TLS for connecting to proxy](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9894):
  + Add `grpc-proxy start --cert-file`, `grpc-proxy start --key-file` and `grpc-proxy start --trusted-ca-file` flags.
* Add [`grpc-proxy start --metrics-addr` flag for specifying a separate metrics listen address](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9894).

### client v3

* Fix [lease keepalive interval updates when response queue is full](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9952).
  + If `<-chan *clientv3LeaseKeepAliveResponse` from `clientv3.Lease.KeepAlive` was never consumed or channel is full, client was [sending keepalive request every 500ms](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/9911) instead of expected rate of every "TTL / 3" duration.

### Go

* Compile with [*Go 1.8.7*](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#go1.8).

---

## [v3.2.23](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.2.23) (2018-06-15)

See [code changes](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/compare/v3.2.22...v3.2.23) and [v3.2 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_2.md) for any breaking changes. **Again, before running upgrades from any previous release, please make sure to read change logs below and [v3.2 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_2.md).**

### Improved

* Improve [slow request apply warning log](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9288).
  + e.g. `read-only range request "key:\"/a\" range_end:\"/b\" " with result "range_response_count:3 size:96" took too long (97.966Âµs) to execute`.
  + Redact [request value field](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9822).
  + Provide [response size](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9826).
* Add [backoff on watch retries on transient errors](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9840).

### Metrics, Monitoring

See [List of metrics](https://etcd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operate.html#v3-2) for all metrics per release.

Note that any `etcd_debugging_*` metrics are experimental and subject to change.

* Add [`etcd_server_version`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8960) Prometheus metric.
  + To replace [Kubernetes `etcd-version-monitor`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/8948).

### Go

* Compile with [*Go 1.8.7*](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#go1.8).

---

## [v3.2.22](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.2.22) (2018-06-06)

See [code changes](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/compare/v3.2.21...v3.2.22) and [v3.2 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_2.md) for any breaking changes. **Again, before running upgrades from any previous release, please make sure to read change logs below and [v3.2 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_2.md).**

### Security, Authentication

* Support TLS cipher suite whitelisting.
  + To block [weak cipher suites](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/8320).
  + TLS handshake fails when client hello is requested with invalid cipher suites.
  + Add [`etcd --cipher-suites`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9801) flag.
  + If empty, Go auto-populates the list.

### Go

* Compile with [*Go 1.8.7*](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#go1.8).

---

## [v3.2.21](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.2.21) (2018-05-31)

See [code changes](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/compare/v3.2.20...v3.2.21) and [v3.2 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_2.md) for any breaking changes. **Again, before running upgrades from any previous release, please make sure to read change logs below and [v3.2 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_2.md).**

### etcd server

* Fix [auth storage panic when simple token provider is disabled](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8695).
* Fix [`mvcc` server panic from restore operation](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9775).
  + Let's assume that a watcher had been requested with a future revision X and sent to node A that became network-partitioned thereafter. Meanwhile, cluster makes progress. Then when the partition gets removed, the leader sends a snapshot to node A. Previously if the snapshot's latest revision is still lower than the watch revision X, **etcd server panicked** during snapshot restore operation.
  + Now, this server-side panic has been fixed.

### Go

* Compile with [*Go 1.8.7*](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#go1.8).

---

## [v3.2.20](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.2.20) (2018-05-09)

See [code changes](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/compare/v3.2.19...v3.2.20) and [v3.2 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_2.md) for any breaking changes. **Again, before running upgrades from any previous release, please make sure to read change logs below and [v3.2 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_2.md).**

### etcd server

* Purge old [`*.snap.db` snapshot files](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/7967).

## [v3.2.19](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.2.19) (2018-04-24)

See [code changes](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/compare/v3.2.18...v3.2.19) and [v3.2 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_2.md) for any breaking changes. **Again, before running upgrades from any previous release, please make sure to read change logs below and [v3.2 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_2.md).**

### Metrics, Monitoring

See [List of metrics](https://etcd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operate.html#v3-2) for all metrics per release.

Note that any `etcd_debugging_*` metrics are experimental and subject to change.

* Fix [`etcd_debugging_server_lease_expired_total`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9557) Prometheus metric.
* Fix [race conditions in v2 server stat collecting](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9562).
* Add [`etcd_server_is_leader`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9587) Prometheus metric.

### Security, Authentication

* Fix [TLS reload](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9570) when [certificate SAN field only includes IP addresses but no domain names](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/9541).
  + In Go, server calls `(*tls.Config).GetCertificate` for TLS reload if and only if server's `(*tls.Config).Certificates` field is not empty, or `(*tls.ClientHelloInfo).ServerName` is not empty with a valid SNI from the client. Previously, etcd always populates `(*tls.Config).Certificates` on the initial client TLS handshake, as non-empty. Thus, client was always expected to supply a matching SNI in order to pass the TLS verification and to trigger `(*tls.Config).GetCertificate` to reload TLS assets.
  + However, a certificate whose SAN field does [not include any domain names but only IP addresses](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/9541) would request `*tls.ClientHelloInfo` with an empty `ServerName` field, thus failing to trigger the TLS reload on initial TLS handshake; this becomes a problem when expired certificates need to be replaced online.
  + Now, `(*tls.Config).Certificates` is created empty on initial TLS client handshake, first to trigger `(*tls.Config).GetCertificate`, and then to populate rest of the certificates on every new TLS connection, even when client SNI is empty (e.g. cert only includes IPs).

### etcd server

* Add [`etcd --initial-election-tick-advance`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9591) flag to configure initial election tick fast-forward.
  + By default, `etcd --initial-election-tick-advance=true`, then local member fast-forwards election ticks to speed up "initial" leader election trigger.
  + This benefits the case of larger election ticks. For instance, cross datacenter deployment may require longer election timeout of 10-second. If true, local node does not need wait up to 10-second. Instead, forwards its election ticks to 8-second, and have only 2-second left before leader election.
  + Major assumptions are that: cluster has no active leader thus advancing ticks enables faster leader election. Or cluster already has an established leader, and rejoining follower is likely to receive heartbeats from the leader after tick advance and before election timeout.
  + However, when network from leader to rejoining follower is congested, and the follower does not receive leader heartbeat within left election ticks, disruptive election has to happen thus affecting cluster availabilities.
  + Now, this can be disabled by setting `--initial-election-tick-advance=false`.
  + Disabling this would slow down initial bootstrap process for cross datacenter deployments. Make tradeoffs by configuring `--initial-election-tick-advance` at the cost of slow initial bootstrap.
  + If single-node, it advances ticks regardless.
  + Address [disruptive rejoining follower node](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/9333).

## [v3.2.18](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.2.18) (2018-03-29)

See [code changes](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/compare/v3.2.17...v3.2.18) and [v3.2 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_2.md) for any breaking changes. **Again, before running upgrades from any previous release, please make sure to read change logs below and [v3.2 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_2.md).**

### Improved

* Adjust [election timeout on server restart](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9415) to reduce [disruptive rejoining servers](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/9333).
  + Previously, etcd fast-forwards election ticks on server start, with only one tick left for leader election. This is to speed up start phase, without having to wait until all election ticks elapse. Advancing election ticks is useful for cross datacenter deployments with larger election timeouts. However, it was affecting cluster availability if the last tick elapses before leader contacts the restarted node.
  + Now, when etcd restarts, it adjusts election ticks with more than one tick left, thus more time for leader to prevent disruptive restart.

### Metrics, Monitoring

See [List of metrics](https://etcd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operate.html#v3-2) for all metrics per release.

Note that any `etcd_debugging_*` metrics are experimental and subject to change.

* Add missing [`etcd_network_peer_sent_failures_total` count](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9437).

## [v3.2.17](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.2.17) (2018-03-08)

See [code changes](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/compare/v3.2.16...v3.2.17) and [v3.2 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_2.md) for any breaking changes. **Again, before running upgrades from any previous release, please make sure to read change logs below and [v3.2 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_2.md).**

### etcd server

* Fix [server panic on invalid Election Proclaim/Resign HTTP(S) requests](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9379).
  + Previously, wrong-formatted HTTP requests to Election API could trigger panic in etcd server.
  + e.g. `curl -L http://localhost:2379/v3/election/proclaim -X POST -d '{"value":""}'`, `curl -L http://localhost:2379/v3/election/resign -X POST -d '{"value":""}'`.
* Prevent [overflow by large `TTL` values for `Lease` `Grant`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9399).
  + `TTL` parameter to `Grant` request is unit of second.
  + Leases with too large `TTL` values exceeding `math.MaxInt64` [expire in unexpected ways](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/9374).
  + Server now returns `rpctypes.ErrLeaseTTLTooLarge` to client, when the requested `TTL` is larger than *9,000,000,000 seconds* (which is >285 years).
  + Again, etcd `Lease` is meant for short-periodic keepalives or sessions, in the range of seconds or minutes. Not for hours or days!
* Enable etcd server [`raft.Config.CheckQuorum` when starting with `ForceNewCluster`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9347).

### Proxy v2

* Fix [v2 proxy leaky HTTP requests](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9336).

### etcd server

* Fix [`mvcc` "unsynced" watcher restore operation](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9297).
  + "unsynced" watcher is watcher that needs to be in sync with events that have happened.
  + That is, "unsynced" watcher is the slow watcher that was requested on old revision.
  + "unsynced" watcher restore operation was not correctly populating its underlying watcher group.
  + Which possibly causes [missing events from "unsynced" watchers](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/9086).
  + A node gets network partitioned with a watcher on a future revision, and falls behind receiving a leader snapshot after partition gets removed. When applying this snapshot, etcd watch storage moves current synced watchers to unsynced since sync watchers might have become stale during network partition. And reset synced watcher group to restart watcher routines. Previously, there was a bug when moving from synced watcher group to unsynced, thus client would miss events when the watcher was requested to the network-partitioned node.

* [Server supports reverse-lookup on wildcard DNS `SAN`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8281). For instance, if peer cert contains only DNS names (no IP addresses) in Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field, server first reverse-lookups the remote IP address to get a list of names mapping to that address (e.g. `nslookup IPADDR`). Then accepts the connection if those names have a matching name with peer cert's DNS names (either by exact or wildcard match). If none is matched, server forward-lookups each DNS entry in peer cert (e.g. look up `example.default.svc` when the entry is `*.example.default.svc`), and accepts connection only when the host's resolved addresses have the matching IP address with the peer's remote IP address. For example, peer B's CSR (with `cfssl`) SAN field is `["*.example.default.svc", "*.example.default.svc.cluster.local"]` when peer B's remote IP address is `10.138.0.2`. When peer B tries to join the cluster, peer A reverse-lookup the IP `10.138.0.2` to get the list of host names. And either exact or wildcard match the host names with peer B's cert DNS names in Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field. If none of reverse/forward lookups worked, it returns an error `"tls: "10.138.0.2" does not match any of DNSNames ["*.example.default.svc","*.example.default.svc.cluster.local"]`.

---

## [v3.2.2](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.2.2) (2017-07-07)

See [code changes](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/compare/v3.2.1...v3.2.2) and [v3.2 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_2.md) for any breaking changes. **Again, before running upgrades from any previous release, please make sure to read change logs below and [v3.2 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_2.md).**

### Improved

* Rate-limit lease revoke on expiration.
* Extend leases on promote to avoid queueing effect on lease expiration.

### Security, Authentication

See [security doc](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/security.md) for more details.

* [Server accepts connections if IP matches, without checking DNS entries](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8223). For instance, if peer cert contains IP addresses and DNS names in Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field, and the remote IP address matches one of those IP addresses, server just accepts connection without further checking the DNS names. For example, peer B's CSR (with `cfssl`) SAN field is `["invalid.domain", "10.138.0.2"]` when peer B's remote IP address is `10.138.0.2` and `invalid.domain` is a invalid host. When peer B tries to join the cluster, peer A successfully authenticates B, since Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field has a valid matching IP address. See [issue#8206](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/8206) for more detail.

### etcd server

* Accept connection with matched IP SAN but no DNS match.
  + Don't check DNS entries in certs if there's a matching IP.

### gRPC gateway

* Use user-provided listen address to connect to gRPC gateway.
  + `net.Listener` rewrites IPv4 0.0.0.0 to IPv6 [::], breaking IPv6 disabled hosts.
  + Only v3.2.0, v3.2.1 are affected.

### Go

* Compile with [*Go 1.8.3*](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#go1.8).

---

## [v3.2.1](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.2.1) (2017-06-23)

See [code changes](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/compare/v3.2.0...v3.2.1) and [v3.2 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_2.md) for any breaking changes. **Again, before running upgrades from any previous release, please make sure to read change logs below and [v3.2 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_2.md).**

### etcd server

* Fix backend database in-memory index corruption issue on restore (only 3.2.0 is affected).

### gRPC gateway

* Fix Txn marshaling.

### Metrics, Monitoring

See [List of metrics](https://etcd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operate.html#v3-2) for all metrics per release.

Note that any `etcd_debugging_*` metrics are experimental and subject to change.

* Fix backend database size debugging metrics.

### Go

* Compile with [*Go 1.8.3*](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#go1.8).

---

## [v3.2.0](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.2.0) (2017-06-09)

See [code changes](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/compare/v3.1.0...v3.2.0) and [v3.2 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_2.md) for any breaking changes. **Again, before running upgrades from any previous release, please make sure to read change logs below and [v3.2 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_2.md).**

### Improved

* Improve backend read concurrency.

### Breaking Changes

* Increased [`--snapshot-count` default value from 10,000 to 100,000](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/7160).
  + Higher snapshot count means it holds Raft entries in memory for longer before discarding old entries.
  + It is a trade-off between less frequent snapshotting and [higher memory usage](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/60589#issuecomment-371977156).
  + User lower `--snapshot-count` value for lower memory usage.
  + User higher `--snapshot-count` value for better availabilities of slow followers (less frequent snapshots from leader).
* `clientv3.Lease.TimeToLive` returns `LeaseTimeToLiveResponse.TTL == -1` on lease not found.
* `clientv3.NewFromConfigFile` is moved to `clientv3/yaml.NewConfig`.
* `embed.Etcd.Peers` field is now `[]*peerListener`.
* Rejects domains names for `--listen-peer-urls` and `--listen-client-urls` (3.1 only prints out warnings), since [domain name is invalid for network interface binding](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/6336).

### Dependency

* Upgrade [`google.golang.org/grpc`](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/releases) from [**`v1.0.4`**](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/releases/tag/v1.0.4) to [**`v1.2.1`**](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/releases/tag/v1.2.1).
* Upgrade [`github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway`](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/releases) to [**`v1.2.0`**](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/releases/tag/v1.2.0).

### Metrics, Monitoring

See [List of metrics](https://etcd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operate.html#v3-2) for all metrics per release.

Note that any `etcd_debugging_*` metrics are experimental and subject to change.

* Add [`etcd_disk_backend_snapshot_duration_seconds`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/7892)
* Add `etcd_debugging_server_lease_expired_total` metrics.

### Security, Authentication

See [security doc](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/security.md) for more details.

* [TLS certificates get reloaded on every client connection](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/7829). This is useful when replacing expiry certs without stopping etcd servers; it can be done by overwriting old certs with new ones. Refreshing certs for every connection should not have too much overhead, but can be improved in the future, with caching layer. Example tests can be found [here](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/b041ce5d514a4b4aaeefbffb008f0c7570a18986/integration/v3_grpc_test.go#L1601-L1757).
* [Server denies incoming peer certs with wrong IP `SAN`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/7687). For instance, if peer cert contains any IP addresses in Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field, server authenticates a peer only when the remote IP address matches one of those IP addresses. This is to prevent unauthorized endpoints from joining the cluster. For example, peer B's CSR (with `cfssl`) SAN field is `["*.example.default.svc", "*.example.default.svc.cluster.local", "10.138.0.27"]` when peer B's actual IP address is `10.138.0.2`, not `10.138.0.27`. When peer B tries to join the cluster, peer A will reject B with the error `x509: certificate is valid for 10.138.0.27, not 10.138.0.2`, because B's remote IP address does not match the one in Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field.
* [Server resolves TLS `DNSNames` when checking `SAN`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/7767). For instance, if peer cert contains only DNS names (no IP addresses) in Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field, server authenticates a peer only when forward-lookups (`dig b.com`) on those DNS names have matching IP with the remote IP address. For example, peer B's CSR (with `cfssl`) SAN field is `["b.com"]` when peer B's remote IP address is `10.138.0.2`. When peer B tries to join the cluster, peer A looks up the incoming host `b.com` to get the list of IP addresses (e.g. `dig b.com`). And rejects B if the list does not contain the IP `10.138.0.2`, with the error `tls: 10.138.0.2 does not match any of DNSNames ["b.com"]`.
* Auth support JWT token.

### etcd server

* RPCs
  + Add Election, Lock service.
* Native client `etcdserver/api/v3client`
  + client "embedded" in the server.
* Logging, monitoring
  + Server warns large snapshot operations.
* Add `etcd --enable-v2` flag to enable v2 API server.
  + `etcd --enable-v2=true` by default.
* Add `etcd --auth-token` flag.
* v3.2 compactor runs [every hour](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/7875).
  + Compactor only supports periodic compaction.
  + Compactor continues to record latest revisions every 5-minute.
  + For every hour, it uses the last revision that was fetched before compaction period, from the revision records that were collected every 5-minute.
  + That is, for every hour, compactor discards historical data created before compaction period.
  + The retention window of compaction period moves to next hour.
  + For instance, when hourly writes are 100 and `--auto-compaction-retention=10`, v3.1 compacts revision 1000, 2000, and 3000 for every 10-hour, while v3.2 compacts revision 1000, 1100, and 1200 for every 1-hour.
  + If compaction succeeds or requested revision has already been compacted, it resets period timer and removes used compacted revision from historical revision records (e.g. start next revision collect and compaction from previously collected revisions).
  + If compaction fails, it retries in 5 minutes.
* Allow snapshot over 512MB.

### client v3

* STM prefetching.
* Add namespace feature.
* Add `ErrOldCluster` with server version checking.
* Translate `WithPrefix()` into `WithFromKey()` for empty key.

### etcdctl v3

* Add `check perf` command.
* Add `etcdctl --from-key` flag to role grant-permission command.
* `lock` command takes an optional command to execute.

### gRPC Proxy

* Proxy endpoint discovery.
* Namespaces.
* Coalesce lease requests.

### etcd gateway

* Support [DNS SRV priority](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/7882) for [smart proxy routing](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/4378).

### Other

* v3 client
  + concurrency package's elections updated to match RPC interfaces.
  + let client dial endpoints not in the balancer.
* Release
  + Annotate acbuild with supports-systemd-notify.
  + Add `nsswitch.conf` to Docker container image.
  + Add ppc64le, arm64(experimental) builds.

### Go

* Compile with [*Go 1.8.3*](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#go1.8).

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1651034#c0)  Sam Fowler    2018-11-19 01:27:46 UTC  ``` Etcd, versions 3.2.0 through 3.2.25 and 3.3.0 through 3.3.10, are vulnerable to an improper authentication issue when role-based access control (RBAC) is used and client-cert-auth is enabled. If an etcd client server's TLS certificate contains a Common Name (CN) which matches a valid RBAC username, a remote attacker may authenticate as that user with any valid (trusted) client certificate in a REST API request to the gRPC-gateway.  Introduced in commit: <https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/commit/0191509637546621d6f2e18e074e955ab8ef374d>  Upstream issue: <https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/10366>  Upstream patch: <https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/commit/bf9d0d8291dc71ecbfb2690612954e1a298154b2> <https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/commit/a9a9466fb8ba11ad7bb6a44d7446fbd072d59887> <https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/commit/99704e2a97e8710da942bdc737417fc9c9a2c03f> <https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/commit/83c051b701d33261eef91a719e4421c81b000ba4>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1651034#c3)  Sam Batschelet    2018-11-27 13:11:40 UTC  ``` From my review, this issue is not reproducible.

Is the patch ready to be merged and just waiting for finishing upstream review.

As far as scope this also affects all etcd 3.2.x and 3.3.x that is using --client-cert-auth.

FTR this issue does not require grpc-proxy.  If etcd is using RBAC and `--client-cert-auth` is enabled. Make sure that the client server certificate `--cert-file` does not include a common name. IF a common name is part of this certificate consider removing. If removal is not possible understand that a RBAC user with username = to CN can be exploited by any REST request to the gRPC-gateway. Essentially the username in the CA will always be used during authentication.   openssl x509 -noout -subject -in client.pem | grep -o 'CN.*'  example curl --key $key --cert $cert --cacert $ca -L <https://localhost:2379/v3beta/kv/put> \   -X POST -d '{"key": "Zm9v", "value": "YmFy"}'   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1651034#c24)  Jan Chaloupka    2019-01-11 15:41:05 UTC  ``` Sam,  checking the etcd release [1] I still don't see any new update.

I should know more today, I am sorry this process takes so long but we (etcd) currently are dependent on 2 specific maintainers to cut an etcd release. I am trying to get involved in this process to improve this turn around.   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1651034#c28)  Sam Batschelet    2019-01-11 22:06:06 UTC  ``` <https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases>  v3.3.11 and v3.3.26 are now live.   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=1651034#c30)  Paul Harvey    2019-01-14 00:27:59 UTC  ``` Re-worded flaw description according to common 23, thanks Sam.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other usersâ€™ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a programâ€™s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hatâ€™s CVE database.

When a technologyâ€”enabled and most likely used by defaultâ€”completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-trackingÂ  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.Â  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.Â  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.Â  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.Â  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.Â  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

---

## [v3.3.12](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.3.12) (2019-TBD)

---

## [v3.3.11](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.3.11) (2019-1-11)

See [code changes](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/compare/v3.3.10...v3.3.11) and [v3.3 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_3.md) for any breaking changes. **Again, before running upgrades from any previous release, please make sure to read change logs below and [v3.3 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_3.md).**

### gRPC Proxy

* Fix [memory leak in cache layer](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/10327).

### Security, Authentication

* Disable [CommonName authentication for gRPC-gateway](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/10366) gRPC-gateway proxy requests to etcd server use the etcd client server TLS certificate. If that certificate contains CommonName we do not want to use that for authentication as it could lead to permission escalation.

### Go

* Compile with [*Go 1.10.7*](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#go1.10).

---

## [v3.3.10](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.3.10) (2018-10-10)

See [code changes](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/compare/v3.3.9...v3.3.10) and [v3.3 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_3.md) for any breaking changes. **Again, before running upgrades from any previous release, please make sure to read change logs below and [v3.3 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_3.md).**

### Improved

* Improve ["became inactive" warning log](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/10024), which indicates message send to a peer failed.
* Improve [read index wait timeout warning log](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/10026), which indicates that local node might have slow network.
* Add [gRPC interceptor for debugging logs](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9990); enable `etcd --debug` flag to see per-request debug information.
* Add [consistency check in snapshot status](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/10109). If consistency check on snapshot file fails, `snapshot status` returns `"snapshot file integrity check failed..."` error.

### Metrics, Monitoring

See [List of metrics](https://etcd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operate.html#v3-3) for all metrics per release.

Note that any `etcd_debugging_*` metrics are experimental and subject to change.

### client v3

* Fix [lease keepalive interval updates when response queue is full](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9952).
  + If `<-chan *clientv3LeaseKeepAliveResponse` from `clientv3.Lease.KeepAlive` was never consumed or channel is full, client was [sending keepalive request every 500ms](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/9911) instead of expected rate of every "TTL / 3" duration.

### etcd server

* Allow [empty auth token](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9369).
  + Previously, when auth token is an empty string, it returns [`failed to initialize the etcd server: auth: invalid auth options` error](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/9349).
* Fix [auth storage panic on server lease revoke routine with JWT token](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/9695).
* Fix [`mvcc` server panic from restore operation](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9775).
  + Let's assume that a watcher had been requested with a future revision X and sent to node A that became network-partitioned thereafter. Meanwhile, cluster makes progress. Then when the partition gets removed, the leader sends a snapshot to node A. Previously if the snapshot's latest revision is still lower than the watch revision X, **etcd server panicked** during snapshot restore operation.
  + Now, this server-side panic has been fixed.

### Metrics, Monitoring

See [List of metrics](https://etcd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operate.html#v3-3) for all metrics per release.

Note that any `etcd_debugging_*` metrics are experimental and subject to change.

* Add [`etcd_server_is_leader`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9587) Prometheus metric.
* Fix [`etcd_debugging_server_lease_expired_total`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9557) Prometheus metric.
* Fix [race conditions in v2 server stat collecting](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9562).

### Security, Authentication

* Fix [TLS reload](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9570) when [certificate SAN field only includes IP addresses but no domain names](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/9541).
  + In Go, server calls `(*tls.Config).GetCertificate` for TLS reload if and only if server's `(*tls.Config).Certificates` field is not empty, or `(*tls.ClientHelloInfo).ServerName` is not empty with a valid SNI from the client. Previously, etcd always populates `(*tls.Config).Certificates` on the initial client TLS handshake, as non-empty. Thus, client was always expected to supply a matching SNI in order to pass the TLS verification and to trigger `(*tls.Config).GetCertificate` to reload TLS assets.
  + However, a certificate whose SAN field does [not include any domain names but only IP addresses](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/9541) would request `*tls.ClientHelloInfo` with an empty `ServerName` field, thus failing to trigger the TLS reload on initial TLS handshake; this becomes a problem when expired certificates need to be replaced online.
  + Now, `(*tls.Config).Certificates` is created empty on initial TLS client handshake, first to trigger `(*tls.Config).GetCertificate`, and then to populate rest of the certificates on every new TLS connection, even when client SNI is empty (e.g. cert only includes IPs).

### etcd server

* Add [`etcd --initial-election-tick-advance`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9591) flag to configure initial election tick fast-forward.
  + By default, `etcd --initial-election-tick-advance=true`, then local member fast-forwards election ticks to speed up "initial" leader election trigger.
  + This benefits the case of larger election ticks. For instance, cross datacenter deployment may require longer election timeout of 10-second. If true, local node does not need wait up to 10-second. Instead, forwards its election ticks to 8-second, and have only 2-second left before leader election.
  + Major assumptions are that: cluster has no active leader thus advancing ticks enables faster leader election. Or cluster already has an established leader, and rejoining follower is likely to receive heartbeats from the leader after tick advance and before election timeout.
  + However, when network from leader to rejoining follower is congested, and the follower does not receive leader heartbeat within left election ticks, disruptive election has to happen thus affecting cluster availabilities.
  + Now, this can be disabled by setting `--initial-election-tick-advance=false`.
  + Disabling this would slow down initial bootstrap process for cross datacenter deployments. Make tradeoffs by configuring `etcd --initial-election-tick-advance` at the cost of slow initial bootstrap.
  + If single-node, it advances ticks regardless.
  + Address [disruptive rejoining follower node](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/9333).

### Package `embed`

* Add [`embed.Config.InitialElectionTickAdvance`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9591) to enable/disable initial election tick fast-forward.
  + `embed.NewConfig()` would return `*embed.Config` with `InitialElectionTickAdvance` as true by default.

### Go

* Compile with [*Go 1.9.5*](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#go1.9).

---

## [v3.3.3](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.3.3) (2018-03-29)

See [code changes](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/compare/v3.3.2...v3.3.3) and [v3.3 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_3.md) for any breaking changes. **Again, before running upgrades from any previous release, please make sure to read change logs below and [v3.3 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_3.md).**

### Improved

* Adjust [election timeout on server restart](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9415) to reduce [disruptive rejoining servers](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/9333).
  + Previously, etcd fast-forwards election ticks on server start, with only one tick left for leader election. This is to speed up start phase, without having to wait until all election ticks elapse. Advancing election ticks is useful for cross datacenter deployments with larger election timeouts. However, it was affecting cluster availability if the last tick elapses before leader contacts the restarted node.
  + Now, when etcd restarts, it adjusts election ticks with more than one tick left, thus more time for leader to prevent disruptive restart.
* Adjust [periodic compaction retention window](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9485).
  + e.g. `etcd --auto-compaction-mode=revision --auto-compaction-retention=1000` automatically `Compact` on `"latest revision" - 1000` every 5-minute (when latest revision is 30000, compact on revision 29000).
  + e.g. Previously, `etcd --auto-compaction-mode=periodic --auto-compaction-retention=72h` automatically `Compact` with 72-hour retention windown for every 7.2-hour. **Now, `Compact` happens, for every 1-hour but still with 72-hour retention window.**
  + e.g. Previously, `etcd --auto-compaction-mode=periodic --auto-compaction-retention=30m` automatically `Compact` with 30-minute retention windown for every 3-minute. **Now, `Compact` happens, for every 30-minute but still with 30-minute retention window.**
  + Periodic compactor keeps recording latest revisions for every compaction period when given period is less than 1-hour, or for every 1-hour when given compaction period is greater than 1-hour (e.g. 1-hour when `etcd --auto-compaction-mode=periodic --auto-compaction-retention=24h`).
  + For every compaction period or 1-hour, compactor uses the last revision that was fetched before compaction period, to discard historical data.
  + The retention window of compaction period moves for every given compaction period or hour.
  + For instance, when hourly writes are 100 and `etcd --auto-compaction-mode=periodic --auto-compaction-retention=24h`, `v3.2.x`, `v3.3.0`, `v3.3.1`, and `v3.3.2` compact revision 2400, 2640, and 2880 for every 2.4-hour, while `v3.3.3` *or later* compacts revision 2400, 2500, 2600 for every 1-hour.
  + Futhermore, when `etcd --auto-compaction-mode=periodic --auto-compaction-retention=30m` and writes per minute are about 1000, `v3.3.0`, `v3.3.1`, and `v3.3.2` compact revision 30000, 33000, and 36000, for every 3-minute, while `v3.3.3` *or later* compacts revision 30000, 60000, and 90000, for every 30-minute.

### Metrics, Monitoring

See [List of metrics](https://etcd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operate.html#v3-3) for all metrics per release.

Note that any `etcd_debugging_*` metrics are experimental and subject to change.

* Add missing [`etcd_network_peer_sent_failures_total` count](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9437).

### Go

* Compile with [*Go 1.9.5*](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#go1.9).

## [v3.3.2](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.3.2) (2018-03-08)

See [code changes](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/compare/v3.3.1...v3.3.2) and [v3.3 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_3.md) for any breaking changes. **Again, before running upgrades from any previous release, please make sure to read change logs below and [v3.3 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_3.md).**

### etcd server

* Fix [server panic on invalid Election Proclaim/Resign HTTP(S) requests](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9379).
  + Previously, wrong-formatted HTTP requests to Election API could trigger panic in etcd server.
  + e.g. `curl -L http://localhost:2379/v3/election/proclaim -X POST -d '{"value":""}'`, `curl -L http://localhost:2379/v3/election/resign -X POST -d '{"value":""}'`.
* Fix [revision-based compaction retention parsing](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9339).
  + Previously, `etcd --auto-compaction-mode revision --auto-compaction-retention 1` was [translated to revision retention 3600000000000](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/9337).
  + Now, `etcd --auto-compaction-mode revision --auto-compaction-retention 1` is correctly parsed as revision retention 1.
* Prevent [overflow by large `TTL` values for `Lease` `Grant`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9399).
  + `TTL` parameter to `Grant` request is unit of second.
  + Leases with too large `TTL` values exceeding `math.MaxInt64` [expire in unexpected ways](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/9374).
  + Server now returns `rpctypes.ErrLeaseTTLTooLarge` to client, when the requested `TTL` is larger than *9,000,000,000 seconds* (which is >285 years).
  + Again, etcd `Lease` is meant for short-periodic keepalives or sessions, in the range of seconds or minutes. Not for hours or days!
* Enable etcd server [`raft.Config.CheckQuorum` when starting with `ForceNewCluster`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9347).

### Proxy v2

* Fix [v2 proxy leaky HTTP requests](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9336).

### Go

* Compile with [*Go 1.9.4*](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#go1.9).

---

## [v3.3.1](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/tag/v3.3.1) (2018-02-12)

See [code changes](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/compare/v3.3.0...v3.3.1) and [v3.3 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_3.md) for any breaking changes. **Again, before running upgrades from any previous release, please make sure to read change logs below and [v3.3 upgrade guide](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/upgrades/upgrade_3_3.md).**

### Improved

* Add [warnings on requests taking too long](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9288).
  + e.g. `etcdserver: read-only range request "key:\"\\000\" range_end:\"\\000\" " took too long [3.389041388s] to execute`

### etcd server

* Fix [`mvcc` "unsynced" watcher restore operation](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9281).
  + "unsynced" watcher is watcher that needs to be in sync with events that have happened.
  + That is, "unsynced" watcher is the slow watcher that was requested on old revision.
  + "unsynced" watcher restore operation was not correctly populating its underlying watcher group.
  + Which possibly causes [missing events from "unsynced" watchers](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/9086).
  + A node gets network partitioned with a watcher on a future revision, and falls behind receiving a leader snapshot after partition gets removed. When applying this snapshot, etcd watch storage moves current synced watchers to unsynced since sync watchers might have become stale during network partition. And reset synced watcher group to restart watcher routines. Previously, there was a bug when moving from synced watcher group to unsynced, thus client would miss events when the watcher was requested to the network-partitioned node.

### Go

### Improved

* Use [`coreos/bbolt`](https://github.com/coreos/bbolt/releases) to replace [`boltdb/bolt`](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt#project-status).
  + Fix [etcd database size grows until `mvcc: database space exceeded`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/8009).
* [Support database size larger than 8GiB](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/7525) (8GiB is now a suggested maximum size for normal environments)
* [Reduce memory allocation](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8428) on [Range operations](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8475).
* [Rate limit](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8099) and [randomize](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8101) lease revoke on restart or leader elections.
  + Prevent [spikes in Raft proposal rate](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/8096).
* Support `clientv3` balancer failover under [network faults/partitions](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/8711).
* Better warning on [mismatched `etcd --initial-cluster`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8083) flag.
  + etcd compares `etcd --initial-advertise-peer-urls` against corresponding `etcd --initial-cluster` URLs with forward-lookup.
  + If resolved IP addresses of `etcd --initial-advertise-peer-urls` and `etcd --initial-cluster` do not match (e.g. [due to DNS error](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9210)), etcd will exit with errors.
    - v3.2 error: `etcd --initial-cluster must include s1=https://s1.test:2380 given --initial-advertise-peer-urls=https://s1.test:2380`.
    - v3.3 error: `failed to resolve https://s1.test:2380 to match --initial-cluster=s1=https://s1.test:2380 (failed to resolve "https://s1.test:2380" (error ...))`.

### Breaking Changes

* Require [`google.golang.org/grpc`](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/releases) [**`v1.7.4`**](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/releases/tag/v1.7.4) or [**`v1.7.5`**](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/releases/tag/v1.7.5).
  + Deprecate [`metadata.Incoming/OutgoingContext`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/7896).
  + Deprecate `grpclog.Logger`, upgrade to [`grpclog.LoggerV2`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8533).
  + Deprecate [`grpc.ErrClientConnTimeout`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8505) errors in `clientv3`.
  + Use [`MaxRecvMsgSize` and `MaxSendMsgSize`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8437) to limit message size, in etcd server.
* Translate [gRPC status error in v3 client `Snapshot` API](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9038).
* v3 `etcdctl` [`lease timetolive LEASE_ID`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/9028) on expired lease now prints [`"lease LEASE_ID already expired"`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9047).
  + <=3.2 prints `"lease LEASE_ID granted with TTL(0s), remaining(-1s)"`.
* Replace [gRPC gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway) endpoint `/v3alpha` with [`/v3beta`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8880).
  + To deprecate [`/v3alpha`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/8125) in v3.4.
  + In v3.3, `curl -L http://localhost:2379/v3alpha/kv/put -X POST -d '{"key": "Zm9v", "value": "YmFy"}'` still works as a fallback to `curl -L http://localhost:2379/v3beta/kv/put -X POST -d '{"key": "Zm9v", "value": "YmFy"}'`, but `curl -L http://localhost:2379/v3alpha/kv/put -X POST -d '{"key": "Zm9v", "value": "YmFy"}'` won't work in v3.4. Use `curl -L http://localhost:2379/v3beta/kv/put -X POST -d '{"key": "Zm9v", "value": "YmFy"}'` instead.
* Change `etcd --auto-compaction-retention` flag to [accept string values](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8563) with [finer granularity](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/8503).
  + Now that `etcd --auto-compaction-retention` accepts string values, etcd configuration YAML file `auto-compaction-retention` field must be changed to `string` type.
  + Previously, `--config-file etcd.config.yaml` can have `auto-compaction-retention: 24` field, now must be `auto-compaction-retention: "24"` or `auto-compaction-retention: "24h"`.
  + If configured as `etcd --auto-compaction-mode periodic --auto-compaction-retention "24h"`, the time duration value for `etcd --auto-compaction-retention` flag must be valid for [`time.ParseDuration`](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration) function in Go.

Note that any `etcd_debugging_*` metrics are experimental and subject to change.

* Add [`etcd --listen-metrics-urls`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8242) flag for additional `/metrics` and `/health` endpoints.
  + Useful for [bypassing critical APIs when monitoring etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/8060).
* Add [`etcd_server_version`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8960) Prometheus metric.
  + To replace [Kubernetes `etcd-version-monitor`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/8948).

  + Also change to [`prometheus.NewGaugeFunc`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8150).

### Security, Authentication

See [security doc](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/security.md) for more details.

* Add [CRL based connection rejection](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8124) to manage [revoked certs](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/4034).
* Document [TLS authentication changes](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8895).
  + [Server accepts connections if IP matches, without checking DNS entries](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8223). For instance, if peer cert contains IP addresses and DNS names in Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field, and the remote IP address matches one of those IP addresses, server just accepts connection without further checking the DNS names.
  + [Server supports reverse-lookup on wildcard DNS `SAN`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8281). For instance, if peer cert contains only DNS names (no IP addresses) in Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field, server first reverse-lookups the remote IP address to get a list of names mapping to that address (e.g. `nslookup IPADDR`). Then accepts the connection if those names have a matching name with peer cert's DNS names (either by exact or wildcard match). If none is matched, server forward-lookups each DNS entry in peer cert (e.g. look up `example.default.svc` when the entry is `*.example.default.svc`), and accepts connection only when the host's resolved addresses have the matching IP address with the peer's remote IP address.
* Add [`etcd --peer-cert-allowed-cn`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8616) flag.
  + To support [CommonName(CN) based auth](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/8262) for inter peer connection.
* [Swap priority](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8594) of cert CommonName(CN) and username + password.
  + To address ["username and password specified in the request should take priority over CN in the cert"](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/8584).
* Protect [lease revoke with auth](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8031).
* Provide user's role on [auth permission error](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8164).
* Fix [auth store panic with disabled token](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8695).

### etcd server

* Add [`etcd --experimental-initial-corrupt-check`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8554) flag to [check cluster database hashes before serving client/peer traffic](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/8313).
  + `etcd --experimental-initial-corrupt-check=false` by default.
  + v3.4 will enable `--initial-corrupt-check=true` by default.
* Add [`etcd --experimental-corrupt-check-time`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8420) flag to [raise corrupt alarm monitoring](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/7125).
  + `etcd --experimental-corrupt-check-time=0s` disabled by default.
* Add [`etcd --experimental-enable-v2v3`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8407) flag to [emulate v2 API with v3](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/6925).
  + `etcd --experimental-enable-v2v3=false` by default.
* Add [`etcd --max-txn-ops`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/7976) flag to [configure maximum number operations in transaction](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/7826).
* Add [`etcd --max-request-bytes`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/7968) flag to [configure maximum client request size](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/7923).
  + If not configured, it defaults to 1.5 MiB.
* Add [`etcd --client-crl-file`, `--peer-crl-file`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8124) flags for [Certificate revocation list](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/4034).
* Add [`etcd --peer-cert-allowed-cn`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8616) flag to support [CN-based auth for inter-peer connection](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/8262).
* Add [`etcd --listen-metrics-urls`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8242) flag for additional `/metrics` and `/health` endpoints.
  + Support [additional (non) TLS `/metrics` endpoints for a TLS-enabled cluster](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8282).
  + e.g. `etcd --listen-metrics-urls=https://localhost:2378,http://localhost:9379` to serve `/metrics` and `/health` on secure port 2378 and insecure port 9379.
  + Useful for [bypassing critical APIs when monitoring etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/8060).
* Add [`etcd --auto-compaction-mode`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8123) flag to [support revision-based compaction](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/8098).
* Change `etcd --auto-compaction-retention` flag to [accept string values](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8563) with [finer granularity](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/8503).
  + Now that `etcd --auto-compaction-retention` accepts string values, etcd configuration YAML file `auto-compaction-retention` field must be changed to `string` type.
  + Previously, `etcd --config-file etcd.config.yaml` can have `auto-compaction-retention: 24` field, now must be `auto-compaction-retention: "24"` or `auto-compaction-retention: "24h"`.
  + If configured as `--auto-compaction-mode periodic --auto-compaction-retention "24h"`, the time duration value for `etcd --auto-compaction-retention` flag must be valid for [`time.ParseDuration`](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration) function in Go.
  + e.g. `etcd --auto-compaction-mode=revision --auto-compaction-retention=1000` automatically `Compact` on `"latest revision" - 1000` every 5-minute (when latest revision is 30000, compact on revision 29000).
  + e.g. `etcd --auto-compaction-mode=periodic --auto-compaction-retention=72h` automatically `Compact` with 72-hour retention windown, for every 7.2-hour.
  + e.g. `etcd --auto-compaction-mode=periodic --auto-compaction-retention=30m` automatically `Compact` with 30-minute retention windown, for every 3-minute.
  + Periodic compactor continues to record latest revisions for every 1/10 of given compaction period (e.g. 1-hour when `etcd --auto-compaction-mode=periodic --auto-compaction-retention=10h`).
  + For every 1/10 of given compaction period, compactor uses the last revision that was fetched before compaction period, to discard historical data.
  + The retention window of compaction period moves for every 1/10 of given compaction period.
  + For instance, when hourly writes are 100 and `--auto-compaction-retention=10`, v3.1 compacts revision 1000, 2000, and 3000 for every 10-hour, while v3.2.x, v3.3.0, v3.3.1, and v3.3.2 compact revision 1000, 1100, and 1200 for every 1-hour. Futhermore, when writes per minute are 1000, v3.3.0, v3.3.1, and v3.3.2 with `--auto-compaction-mode=periodic --auto-compaction-retention=30m` compact revision 30000, 33000, and 36000, for every 3-minute with more finer granularity.
  + Whether compaction succeeds or not, this process repeats for every 1/10 of given compaction period. If compaction succeeds, it just removes compacted revision from historical revision records.
* Add [`etcd --grpc-keepalive-min-time`, `etcd --grpc-keepalive-interval`, `etcd --grpc-keepalive-timeout`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8535) flags to configure server-side keepalive policies.
* Serve [`/health` endpoint as unhealthy](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8272) when [alarm (e.g. `NOSPACE`) is raised or there's no leader](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/8207).
  + Define [`etcdhttp.Health`](https://godoc.org/github.com/coreos/etcd/etcdserver/api/etcdhttp#Health) struct with JSON encoder.
  + Note that `"health"` field is [`string` type, not `bool`](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9143).
    - e.g. `{"health":"false"}`, `{"health":"true"}`
  + [Remove `"errors"` field](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/9162) since `v3.3.0-rc.3` (did exist only in `v3.3.0-rc.0`, `v3.3.0-rc.1`, `v3.3.0-rc.2`).
* Move [logging setup to embed package](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8810)
  + Disable gRPC server info-level logs by default (can be enabled with `etcd --debug` flag).
* Use [monotonic time in Go 1.9](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8507) for `lease` package.
* Warn on [empty hosts in advertise URLs](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8384).
  + Address [advertise client URLs accepts empty hosts](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/8379).
  + etcd v3.4 will exit on this error.
    - e.g. `etcd --advertise-client-urls=http://:2379`.
* Warn on [shadowed environment variables](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/8385).
  + Address [error on shadowed environment variables](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/8380).
  + etcd v3.4 will exit on this error.

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 29 Beta Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [GLIBC228](/wiki/Changes/GLIBC228 "Changes/GLIBC228")
* [BINUTILS230](/wiki/Changes/BINUTILS230 "Changes/BINUTILS230")
* [i686\_Is\_For\_x86-64](/wiki/Changes/i686_Is_For_x86-64 "Changes/i686 Is For x86-64")
* [BINUTILS231](/wiki/Changes/BINUTILS231 "Changes/BINUTILS231")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Wednesday, July 11th. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

**NOTE:** As  [BINUTILS231](/wiki/Changes/BINUTILS231 "Changes/BINUTILS231")  requires more time to test and fix issues,
we are postponing the mass rebuild and we will re-evaluate the status on Friday, July 13th.

**NOTE:** Issues with  [BINUTILS231](/wiki/Changes/BINUTILS231 "Changes/BINUTILS231")  got fixed with binutils-2.30.90-3.fc29
build, so we are starting mass rebuilds early on Thursday, July 12th.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f29
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f29. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f29 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f29
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

* [Packages that failed to build](https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org/mass-rebuild/f29-failures.html)
* [Packages that need to be rebuilt](https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org/mass-rebuild/f29-need-rebuild.html)

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a rpm build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild.

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

Currently there is no plan to logically order the rebuilds based on deps. The ordering will be alphanumerical based on package name. There are no planned ABI/soname changes that would require logical build ordering. Further, all the builds will be kept in a special tag (f29-rebuild) until the whole run is done, and then they will be tagged into f29 in one shot to minimize the shuffle of buildroot contents during the rebuilds.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.
