Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-16384:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) parses and handles specially crafted SQL statements.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection bypass in the ModSecurity CRS ruleset.
- The vulnerability allows a specific syntax (`{`a`b}`) to bypass the WAF, where `a` represents a function name (e.g., "if"), and `b` the SQL statement to be executed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can bypass the ModSecurity WAF and inject malicious SQL queries into the backend database.
- Successful exploitation can lead to data exfiltration, modification, or other unauthorized actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP requests containing malicious SQL syntax within parameters, specifically using the `{`a`b}` format, where a is a function, such as "if", and b the SQL statement.
-  The vulnerability can be exploited through web application interfaces that are vulnerable to SQL injection and protected by ModSecurity CRS.
- In the example provided, the attack was executed via the `id` parameter in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to a web application protected by ModSecurity CRS.
- The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax and the `{`a`b}` bypass technique.
- The attacker needs to be able to identify SQL injection points in the target application.

**Additional Details:**

- The issue was discovered in OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set through version 3.1.0-rc3.
- The provided example shows how to extract the database name using the vulnerable syntax and error messages.
- A patch is included in the Debian LTS update DLA-3293-1 for modsecurity-crs.
