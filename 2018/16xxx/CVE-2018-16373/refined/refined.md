- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The file manager plugin in Frog CMS 0.9.5 allows arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient checks when creating new files via the `save()` function. Specifically, the application directly creates a file based on user-provided filename and content without proper validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unrestricted file upload.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can upload arbitrary files, potentially including malicious scripts (e.g., PHP files), leading to remote code execution on the server.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a crafted POST request to `/admin/?/plugin/file_manager/save` with a new filename and content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have access to the admin panel of the Frog CMS instance.
