Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the storage and display of external service passwords in cleartext within the Squash TM administration panel. When defining an external service (like a Jenkins server), the password for that service's account is stored and displayed in the HTML source code of the service's configuration page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Cleartext Storage:** Passwords for external services are not hashed or encrypted.
-   **Cleartext Display:** The password is displayed directly in the HTML source of the web page, accessible to anyone who views the page's source.
-   **Lack of Need to Display:** The password information is not needed and should not be present in the UI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker who gains access to the Squash TM administration panel can view the cleartext passwords of configured external services.
-   **Lateral Movement:** With the obtained credentials for these external services, attackers can move laterally within the network to other systems (e.g., Jenkins servers). This is a critical issue, as access to systems like Jenkins could grant attackers significant control over CI/CD pipelines and possibly production deployments.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Web Interface:** The attack is carried out through the Squash TM web interface.
-   **Access to Admin Panel:** Attackers need access to the administration panel of Squash TM to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Authentication:** An attacker must have administrator-level access to the Squash TM web application. This could be achieved by using the default credentials of admin:admin.
-   **Network Access:** Access to the network where the Squash TM instance is hosted is required to reach the web interface.

**Additional Details:**

-   The vulnerability is present in the section where external automation servers are defined in Squash TM.
-   The reporter mentions that if the password is provided, it should be hashed.
-   The default credentials for Squash TM are admin:admin, which can make this vulnerability easier to exploit if not changed.
- The CVSS score provided is: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N
