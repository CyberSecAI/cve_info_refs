{
  "CVE-2018-16152": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The algorithmIdentifier parser in the ASN.1 code within the gmp plugin of strongSwan does not enforce a NULL value for the optional parameter which is not used with any PKCS#1 algorithm.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insufficient input validation in the gmp plugin's ASN.1 parsing code, specifically not enforcing a NULL value for the optional parameters field in the algorithmIdentifier structure during PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification. This allows arbitrary data in this field.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could forge signatures using low-exponent RSA keys, potentially bypassing authorization or impersonating a user when only an RSA signature is used for IKEv2 authentication.",
      "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can send a crafted signature, taking advantage of the lenient ASN.1 parser. This is specifically applicable when low-exponent RSA keys are in use.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable strongSwan instance and knowledge or ability to guess the length of the public key, as well as the capability to forge signatures based on specific flaws. The attacker does not need to know the actual public key but needs to use a key of the same length."
