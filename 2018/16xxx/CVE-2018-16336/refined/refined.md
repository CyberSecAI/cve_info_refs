Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2018-16336:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of certain files within the Exiv2 library, specifically during the parsing of PNG text chunks (`tEXt` and `zTXt`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow/over-read:** The primary issue is a heap-based buffer overflow, triggered during the parsing of `tEXt` and `zTXt` chunks in PNG images. This occurs in the `Exiv2::Internal::PngChunk::parseTXTChunk()` function and also within the `std::count` function which leads to a read out-of-bounds.
- Specifically, `poc1-heapoverflow` triggers a heap-buffer-overflow in `Exiv2::Internal::PngChunk::parseTXTChunk()` at `src/pngchunk_int.cpp:140`, where the code attempts to read beyond the allocated memory.
- `poc2-heapoverflow` triggers a heap-buffer-overflow in `bool __gnu_cxx::__ops::_Iter_equals_val<char const>::operator()<unsigned char*>(unsigned char*)` at `/usr/include/c++/5/bits/predefined_ops.h:194` and then in `Exiv2::Internal::PngChunk::parseTXTChunk()` at `src/pngchunk_int.cpp:167`, due to incorrect handling of the compressed text data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service. This is achieved by crafting a malicious PNG image that, when processed by Exiv2, triggers a heap-based buffer overflow or out-of-bounds read causing the application to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously crafted PNG images:** The attack vector is a specially crafted PNG image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious PNG file to an application that uses the vulnerable Exiv2 library.
- No specific privilege is mentioned, so it is likely that the vulnerability can be triggered with no user privileges.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided github issue #400 on Exiv2's repository provides the most detail, including source code locations and example crash logs.
- The issue was discovered using a memory-based AFL fuzzer (mem-AFL).
- The vulnerability was present in Exiv2 master branch and v0.26.
- The Debian Security Advisory (DLA 1551-1) lists CVE-2018-16336 as a heap-based buffer over-read/overflow.
- Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-3852-1) also confirms the vulnerability and lists the affected packages.
