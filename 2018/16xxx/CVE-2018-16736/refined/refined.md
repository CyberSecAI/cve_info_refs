Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-16736:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of user input in the `_whatfilter` and `_messages` parameters within the rcfilters plugin for Roundcube.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the user's filter settings. This code can then be executed within the context of the user's browser session, potentially leading to:
    - Account compromise
    - Data theft
    - Session hijacking
    - Other malicious actions

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious POST request to the `/rc/?_task=settings&_action=plugin.filters-save` endpoint, injecting JavaScript code into the `_whatfilter` and `_messages` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP requests, and the target user needs to view their filter settings. The attacker could potentially craft the malicious POST request through social engineering methods.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit is demonstrated using a POST request with the vulnerable parameters.
- The vulnerability is considered a "self-XSS" because a user must perform the malicious action on their own account in order for the code to be executed. This could be achieved by a malicious user or by a malicious actor tricking a user into pasting code into the affected fields.
- The vulnerability affects version 2.1.6 of the `rcfilters` plugin for Roundcube.
- The vulnerability was tested on Roundcube version 1.0.5.
