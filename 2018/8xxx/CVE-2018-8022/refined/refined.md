The provided content is related to a pull request in the Apache Traffic Server project, specifically addressing an issue related to TLS and `ink_release_assert`. While it does not explicitly mention CVE-2018-8022, the discussion and code changes seem to be related to the general area of TLS handling, which might be related to the CVE.

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause appears to be an overly aggressive assertion (`ink_release_assert`) in the TLS handshake handling code. This assertion was triggered when unexpected TLS handshake behavior occurred, potentially due to a misbehaving client. The assertion would terminate the connection instead of gracefully handling the situation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Assertion Failure:** The primary weakness is the use of `ink_release_assert` which leads to a hard termination of the connection when triggered. This doesn't allow for graceful handling of unexpected behavior from a client.
*   **Potential for Denial of Service:** While not explicitly stated, a client intentionally triggering the assertion could cause a denial-of-service for the server if it repeatedly triggers the assert by sending crafted TLS data.
*   **Lack of Robust Error Handling:** The original code lacked robust error handling for specific TLS handshake issues, relying solely on the assertion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The direct impact of the original assertion was connection termination.
*   An attacker may be able to trigger this assert repeatedly, causing a denial-of-service for clients that try to connect to the server.
*   The impact is limited to denial of service. The vulnerability doesn't seem to allow for data breaches or other attack vectors.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   A client sending malformed TLS handshake data could trigger the assertion.
*   An attacker could use a modified client to specifically send the data that will trigger the assert in `SSLNetVConnection::read_handshake_data`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to establish a TLS connection with the server.
*   The attacker would need knowledge of the specific conditions that would trigger the problematic assertion (or use trial and error).

**Additional details from the content**

*   The pull request replaces the `ink_release_assert` with a conditional check and sets up the read bio to read the remaining data.
*   There is discussion about whether to fail the connection instead, but the chosen approach is to try to gracefully handle the situation by resetting the rbio.
*   Code was refactored to avoid copy/paste of rbio code.
*   The fix was initially targeted for the 8.0.0 release, then backported to 7.1.0.

The content describes the resolution of a vulnerability that could lead to connection termination due to a TLS handshake assert, and although the provided content does not specifically mention CVE-2018-8022, it does describe a weakness that can be exploited to cause a denial of service, which may be related to CVE-2018-8022.
