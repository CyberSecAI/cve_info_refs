Is this block same logic in other 2 places (line 447 and line 1078) in this class?

If so, it'd be great if we can avoid copy & past.

| Thought on this some more this morning. Perhaps all we should do is replace the ink\_release\_assert with a ink\_assert and fail the connection in this case. I think if the assert is triggered, the client is behaving badly. Of course we can try to stumble on (this code addition). Perhaps that is ok too. But at a minimum the ink\_release\_assert should be removed/replaced. |

This forces a blind tunnel to wait for the socket to be come read ready?

That is correct. When the epoll shows data ready to read it will set the trigger.
