Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-8038

**Description:** Apache CXF Fediz is vulnerable to DTD-based XML attacks.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that Document Type Declarations (DTDs) were not fully disabled when parsing responses from the Identity Provider (IdP). Although a previous fix (CVE-2015-5175) addressed DoS attacks via DTDs, it did not completely disable them. This incomplete fix left Fediz plugins and the Fediz IdP susceptible to DTD-based XML attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Incomplete DTD Disablement:**  The core weakness is the incomplete disabling of DTD processing in the XML parsing logic. This allows attackers to inject malicious DTDs.
*   **DTD Based XML Attacks:** The vulnerability can be exploited through the use of malicious DTDs which can lead to various attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **XML External Entity (XXE) Attacks:** The primary risk associated with this vulnerability is the potential for XXE attacks. This can lead to:
    *   **Information Disclosure:**  Attackers could potentially read local files or access internal resources by including a reference to an external entity within the XML.
    *   **Denial of Service:**  Although the original DoS attack vector was addressed in CVE-2015-5175,  it's possible that a crafted DTD could still cause resource exhaustion.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Manipulated IdP Responses:** An attacker could inject a malicious DTD within the response from the Identity Provider (IdP).
*   **WS-Federation Request Parameters:** Some of the parameters in WS-Federation requests are also vulnerable to DTD-based XML attacks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker would need to be able to manipulate the XML responses from the Identity Provider (IdP) or influence the WS-Federation request parameters.
*   The attacker needs to have a position where they can insert malicious XML payloads that will be processed by the vulnerable Fediz instance.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The fix for this vulnerability is in version 1.4.4 of Apache CXF Fediz.
*   The provided content includes a commit (b6ed9865d0614332fa419fe4b6d0fe81bc2e660d) that shows the code changes addressing the vulnerability, specifically disabling DTDs using `DBF.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);`.
*  A test case `testEntityExpansionWReq2` was added to verify the fix, sending a crafted XML payload that would have previously exploited the vulnerability.
