Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-8739:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the privileged helper tool of VPN Unlimited for MacOS. This tool implements an XPC interface which allows arbitrary applications to execute system commands with root privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure XPC Interface:** The privileged helper tool exposes an XPC interface that lacks proper authorization or input sanitization, enabling any application to interact with it.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The ability to execute system commands as root, granted through this XPC interface, allows for privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can achieve complete control of the affected system by executing arbitrary commands with root privileges. This allows them to read, write, modify, or delete any files, install malware, or perform any other action that a root user can.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Exploitation:** Any local application or process running on the vulnerable system can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the target system (e.g., a malicious application or a compromised user account).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects VPN Unlimited for MacOS versions prior to 4.2.0.
- The vulnerability was reported by Benjamin Watson of VerSprite Security.
