## You Asked, We Answered

Is Gravatar really free?

Yes, Gravatar profiles are completely free for individual users. We're committed to providing a valuable and open service for the web.

Can I use a custom domain?

Absolutely! You can personalize your Gravatar profile with your own domain. You can register a domain on our sister service, WordPress.com, and map it to your Gravatar profile.

How does Gravatar compare with other link-in-bio services?

Gravatar is an open alternative to profile page services like LinkTree. Integrated across millions of websites, Gravatar avatars and profiles ensure a consistent presence online. You have full control with no data lock-in and can use your own custom domain. Update your profile once, and it updates everywhere.

Can I have multiple Gravatars?

Yes! You can create different Gravatars and profiles for various aspects of your life — work, personal, hobbies, or anonymous profiles. Just create additional accounts using a different email address.

Who owns Gravatar?

Gravatar is a service by Automattic, the company behind WordPress.com, Tumblr, Pocket Casts, Day One, Beeper, WooCommerce, and other popular web services. We are passionate about open-source and making the web a more accessible place.
