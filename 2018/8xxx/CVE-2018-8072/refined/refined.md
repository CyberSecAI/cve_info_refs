      "attack_vectors": [
        "The attack vector is unknown due to the lack of vulnerability specifics. It can be assumed it involves the usage of the specific software/system targeted by the vulnerability. The proof of concept file suggests that the vulnerability could be exploited with crafted input."
      ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "The necessary attacker capabilities are not specifically detailed, but the existence of a proof-of-concept file implies that the vulnerability is exploitable with the required knowledge and possibly, a network connection if the target is a service."
