Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing edge case in how Windows handles token trust SIDs when setting a primary token using `NtSetInformationProcess` (specifically within `PspAssignPrimaryToken`).  Normally, a token's trust SID should be reset when a new token is set on a process, to ensure that a process cannot gain elevated privileges by using a token from a more privileged process. However, this reset doesn't occur when setting a token with NtSetInformationProcess.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Token Trust SID Bypass:** The core issue is the failure to reset the trust SID of a duplicated token when it's set as the primary token of a process through `NtSetInformationProcess`. This allows a less privileged process to retain the trust SID of a more privileged process.
- **Missing Access Check:** The system fails to properly enforce the trust label access check, allowing a process with an improperly high trust SID to bypass security measures that would normally restrict access based on the process's protection level.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, a low-privileged user can gain the ability to act with the privileges associated with a higher protection level process. This includes bypassing access checks intended to prevent tampering of system resources or access to other processes.
- **Tampering with Protected Objects:** The provided example demonstrates the ability to set a trust label on a new event object, which a normal user should not be able to do. This means a user can potentially manipulate protected resources that are normally only accessible by highly privileged system components.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local:** The attack requires local access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Normal User Access:** An attacker needs the ability to run a process on the system as a normal, non-administrative user.
- **Ability to Create and Manipulate Processes:** The attacker needs to be able to create processes (including suspended processes), duplicate tokens, and set tokens using `NtSetInformationProcess`.
- **Knowledge of Protected Process:** The attacker needs to know a process that runs at a higher protection level than the attacker's process and be able to obtain a handle to that process's token.

**Steps to Exploit:**

1.  **Create a Protected Process:** The attacker creates a protected process (e.g., `werfaultsecure.exe`) that has a higher trust SID.
2.  **Duplicate Token:** The attacker opens the process token of the protected process and duplicates it to a new token.
3.  **Create Suspended Process:** The attacker creates a new process in a suspended state.
4.  **Set Primary Token:** The attacker sets the duplicated token (with the higher trust SID) as the primary token of the suspended process using `NtSetInformationProcess`.
5.  **Resume Process:** The attacker resumes the process, which now has the elevated trust SID.
6.  **Bypass Access Checks:** The attacker can now perform actions that require the higher protection level, such as manipulating a protected object.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided text also mentions a related issue with impersonation tokens but states that it does not have an obvious use case.
- The included Proof of Concept (PoC) code demonstrates the described exploit.
- The vulnerability affects Windows 10 1709 and also the current build of RS4 (at the time of writing).
