{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Zookeeper did not enforce authentication/authorization when a server attempts to join a Zookeeper quorum.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Lack of authentication/authorization for server-to-server communication within a Zookeeper quorum.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthorized server could potentially join the quorum, leading to unauthorized access to configuration information and potentially disrupting the Zookeeper service.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious or compromised server attempting to join a Zookeeper quorum.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need to be able to initiate a connection to the Zookeeper ensemble as if it were a legitimate server joining the quorum."
