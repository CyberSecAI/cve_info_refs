{
  "CVE-2018-8056": [
    {
      "Root cause": "The 'channel_name' and 'platform' parameters are not sanitized or filtered before being used in SQL queries.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection"
      ],
      "Impact": "Full information disclosure is possible via SQL injection.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "HTTP POST request to /index.php?/manage/channel/addchannel",
         "HTTP GET request to /export.php"
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
        "Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application."
      ],
       "Details": "The vulnerability allows for error-based and AND/OR time-based blind SQL injection. The provided payloads demonstrate how an attacker could inject malicious SQL code through the 'channel_name' parameter to extract data or cause a time delay."
    },
    {
        "Root cause": "The application leaks physical path information in error messages.",
        "Weaknesses": [
          "Path disclosure"
        ],
        "Impact": "Exposure of the server's internal directory structure. This information can assist an attacker in further attacks.",
        "Attack vectors": [
            "HTTP GET request to /export.php",
            "HTTP POST request to /index.php?/manage/channel/addchannel with specific parameters"
          ],
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
          "Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application."
        ],
        "Details": "The application leaks the server's full file path via error messages displayed when the parameters 'type', 'svg', and 'filename' are not provided to '/export.php' and via error message when SQL injection occurs in '/index.php?/manage/channel/addchannel'"
      }
