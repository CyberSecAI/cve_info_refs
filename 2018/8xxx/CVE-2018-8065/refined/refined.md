Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-8065:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition caused by a buffer overflow within the HTTP header parsing code of the Flexense HTTP Server. Specifically, it involves filling up a queue structure, leading to a user space write access violation in the `syncbrs.exe` process's memory region.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer Overflow: The core issue is a buffer overflow that occurs when the HTTP server attempts to handle a large number of requests, causing a write outside of the intended memory bounds.
- Lack of Input Validation: The server does not properly validate the number of requests or the size of the HTTP headers, leading to the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Successful exploitation results in the crash of the `syncbrs.exe` process, causing the Sync Breeze Enterprise HTTP server to become unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack via HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker sends a large number of HTTP requests to the target server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target system running the vulnerable Flexense HTTP Server (e.g. Sync Breeze Enterprise).
- No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Flexense HTTP Server versions <= 10.6.24, impacting products like Sync Breeze Enterprise, DiskBoss, and others that utilize the vulnerable server component.
- The number of requests required to crash the server varies between 200-1000 depending on the OS version and system memory.
- The vulnerability is triggered by a user-space write access violation on the `syncbrs.exe` memory region.
- A Metasploit module (`auxiliary/dos/http/flexense_http_server_dos`) was created to exploit this vulnerability.
- A python exploit was also created which triggers this vulnerability.
