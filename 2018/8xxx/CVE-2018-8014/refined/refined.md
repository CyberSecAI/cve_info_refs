Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information relevant to CVE-2018-8014:

**1. Summary of CVE-2018-8014:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Insecure default settings in the CORS filter in Apache Tomcat. The `supportsCredentials` property, which controls whether credentials (such as cookies) can be sent with cross-origin requests, was enabled for all origins by default.
*   **Root cause:** The default configuration of the CORS filter in Apache Tomcat was too permissive.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Defaults:** The primary weakness is the insecure default of the Tomcat CORS filter, which activates `supportsCredentials` for every domain.
*   **CORS Bypass**: The insecure default settings would enable 'supportsCredentials' for all origins, contrary to expected behaviour.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of Credentials:**  The primary impact of this vulnerability is the potential exposure of credentials (e.g. cookies) since browsers allow the sharing of credentials with any origin, potentially leading to further exploitation.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks:** While not directly a result of the Tomcat vulnerability, the default behavior can be leveraged by Cross-site scripting(XSS) attacks which may be further exploited if a malicious website sends a CORS request with a crafted payload.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** Attackers can exploit this remotely by sending malicious requests from any origin that could be used to perform actions on the vulnerable system.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No specific position** is required, however,  an attacker may require:
    *  The target application must be configured to use Tomcat's CORS filter with default settings.
    *  The attacker must be able to send a CORS request to the vulnerable system.

**Additional Information from the Content:**

*   **Red Hat's perspective:**
    *   Red Hat considers this a Moderate severity issue.
    *   Red Hat acknowledges that library usage affects CVSS scoring, and they adjust library scores based on Red Hat's usage and common usage.
    *   Red Hat uses a four-point severity scale, alongside CVSS scores.
*   **Debian's perspective:**
    *   Debian has addressed this vulnerability in several advisories, highlighting its impact on their systems.
    *   Debian's advisory also mentions that, it's expected that users of the CORS filter will have configured it appropriately for their environment rather than using it in the default configuration and most users will not be impacted.
*   **Upstream fix:**
    *   The vulnerability was fixed upstream in Apache Tomcat.

*   **Mitigations:**
     *  Users are expected to configure the CORS filter rather than use it in the default configuration.
     * Disabling the `supportsCredentials` option on the CORS filter.
     * Red Hat suggests that users use a CVSS base score from Red Hat instead of third-party scores.
*   **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects tomcat versions including tomcat7 and tomcat8. This also includes products using tomcat, like Red Hat JBoss Web Server, and packages using tomcat such as, but not limited to the following:
       * Red Hat JBoss Web Server
       * Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3 for RHEL 7
       * Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3 for RHEL 6
       * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8
       * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
       * Red Hat Fuse 7.2
       * Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes
       * Red Hat OpenShift
