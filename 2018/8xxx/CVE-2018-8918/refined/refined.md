- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the `info.cgi` file of Synology Router Manager (SRM).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue, specifically a reflected XSS, due to improper handling of user-supplied input.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can inject arbitrary web script or HTML. This can lead to various impacts including but not limited to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through the `host` parameter in `info.cgi`. Attackers can craft malicious URLs containing JavaScript payloads that are then reflected back to the user, executing the script in the user's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers need the ability to craft URLs. The attacker needs a user to click the malicious link for the payload to execute. This requires user interaction. The attacker needs low privileges (PR:L).
