# Zip Slip Vulnerability

Zip Slip is a widespread arbitrary file overwrite critical vulnerability, which typically results in remote command execution. It was discovered and responsibly disclosed by the Snyk Security team ahead of a public disclosure on 5th June 2018, and affects thousands of projects, including ones from HP, Amazon, Apache, Pivotal and  [many more (CVEs and full list here).](https://github.com/snyk/zip-slip-vulnerability)  Of course, this type of vulnerability has existed before, but recently it has manifested itself in a much larger number of projects and libraries.

![Zip Slip](https://res.cloudinary.com/snyk/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,c_thumb,h_225,w_225/v1527156415/research/zipslip.png)

The vulnerability has been found in multiple ecosystems, including JavaScript, Ruby, .NET and Go, but is especially prevalent in Java, where there is no central library offering high level processing of archive (e.g. zip) files. The lack of such a library led to vulnerable code snippets being hand crafted and shared among developer communities such as  [StackOverflow.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/981578/how-to-unzip-files-recursively-in-java)

The vulnerability is exploited using a specially crafted archive that holds directory traversal filenames (e.g. ../../evil.sh). The Zip Slip vulnerability can affect numerous archive formats, including tar, jar, war, cpio, apk, rar and 7z. If you’d like the information on this page in a downloadable technical white paper, click the button below.

 [Download Technical White Paper](https://res.cloudinary.com/snyk/image/upload/v1528192501/zip-slip-vulnerability/technical-whitepaper.pdf)

Zip Slip is a form of directory traversal that can be exploited by extracting files from an archive. The premise of the directory traversal vulnerability is that an attacker can gain access to parts of the file system outside of the target folder in which they should reside. The attacker can then overwrite executable files and either invoke them remotely or wait for the system or user to call them, thus achieving remote command execution on the victim’s machine. The vulnerability can also cause damage by overwriting configuration files or other sensitive resources, and can be exploited on both client (user) machines and servers.

##### Exploitable Application Flow

The two parts required to exploit this vulnerability is a malicious archive and extraction code that does not perform validation checking. Let’s look through each of these in turn. First of all, the contents of the zip file needs to have one or more files that break out of the target directory when extracted. In the example below, we can see the contents of a zip file. It has two files, a good.sh file which would be extracted into the target directory and an evil.sh file which is trying to traverse up the directory tree to hit the root and then add a file into the tmp directory. When you attempt to cd .. in the root directory, you still find yourself in the root directory, so a malicious path could contain many levels of ../ to stand a better chance of reaching the root directory, before trying to traverse to sensitive files.

```
  5 Tue Jun 5 11:04:29 BST 2018 good.sh 20 Tue Jun 5 11:04:42 BST 2018 ../../../../../../../../tmp/evil.sh
```

The contents of this zip file have to be hand crafted. Archive creation tools don’t typically allow users to add files with these paths, despite the zip specification allowing it. However, with the right tools, it’s easy to create files with these paths.

 The second thing you’ll need to exploit this vulnerability is to extract the archive, either using your own code or a library. The vulnerability exists when the extraction code omits validation on the file paths in the archive. An example of a vulnerable code snippet (example shown in Java) can be seen below.

```
  1   Enumeration<ZipEntry>entries = zip.getEntries();
  2   while (entries.hasMoreElements()) {
  3       ZipEntry e = entries.nextElement();
  4       File f = new File(destinationDir, e.getName());
  5       InputStream input = zip.getInputStream(e);
  6       IOUtils.copy(input, write(f));
  7   }
```

You can see on line 4, e.getName() is concatenated with the target directory, dir, without being validated. At this point, when our zip archive gets to our evil.sh, it will append the full path (including every ../) of the zip entry to the target directory resulting in evil.sh being written outside of the target directory.

 To see Zip Slip in action,  [watch us exploit the vulnerable java-goof application](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1MT5lr4p9o)  , a sample application used to show many known vulnerabilities.

##### Are you Vulnerable?

You are vulnerable if you are either using a library which contains the Zip Slip vulnerability or your project directly contains vulnerable code, which extracts files from an archive without the necessary directory traversal validation. Snyk is maintaining a [GitHub repository listing all](https://github.com/snyk/zip-slip-vulnerability) projects that have been found vulnerable to Zip Slip and have been responsibly disclosed to, including fix dates and versions. The repository is open to contributions from the wider community to ensure it holds the most up to date status.s.

##### What action should you take?

Here are some steps you can take to check if your project’s dependencies of code contain the Zip Slip vulnerability:

##### 1. Search through your projects for vulnerable code.

JavaGroovyJavaScript.NETGoRuby & Python
##### 2. Add Zip Slip Security Testing to your application build pipeline

If you’d prefer not to search through your direct and transitive dependencies (of which you likely have hundreds) to determine if you’re using a vulnerable library, you can choose a dependency vulnerability scanning tool, like Snyk. It’s a good practice to add security testing into your development lifecycle stages, such as during development, CI, deployment and production. You can test your own projects (all the ecosystems mentioned above are supported) to determine if they are vulnerable to Zip Slip.

##### Other vulnerable projects

Vulnerable projects include projects in various ecosystems that either use the libraries mentioned above or directly include vulnerable code. Of the many thousands of projects that have contained similar vulnerable code samples or accessed vulnerable libraries, the most significant include: Oracle, Amazon, Spring/Pivotal, Linkedin, Twitter, Alibaba, Jenkinsci, Eclipse, OWASP, SonarQube, OpenTable, Arduino, ElasticSearch, Selenium, JetBrains and Google.

##### Thank you!

The Snyk security team would like for thank all the vendors, project owners and the community members that helped raise awareness, find and fix vulnerabilities in projects across many ecosystems.

### Do your applications use this vulnerable package?

In a few clicks we can analyze your entire application and see what components are vulnerable in your application, and suggest you quick fixes.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1593018#c0)  Laura Pardo    2018-06-19 21:04:45 UTC  ``` A vulnerability has been found in the way developers have implemented the archive extraction of files. An arbitrary file write vulnerability, that can be achieved using a specially crafted zip archive (affects other archives as well, bzip2, tar,xz, war, cpio, 7z), that holds path traversal filenames. So when the filename gets concatenated to the target extraction directory, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. Of course if an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily. This affects multiple libraries that lacks of a high level APIs that provide the archive extraction functionality.   References: <https://snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability>  Patch: <https://github.com/apache/hadoop/commit/745f203e577bacb35b042206db94615141fa5e6f#diff-19cfa944d1bb9ce1daa46aa4223f3642>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1593018#c1)  Laura Pardo    2018-06-19 21:06:20 UTC  ``` Created hadoop tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1593020](show_bug.cgi?id=1593020 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-8009 hadoop: arbitrary file write vulnerability / arbitrary code execution using a specially crafted zip file [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1593018#c2)  Siddharth Sharma    2018-06-20 06:17:19 UTC  ``` This flaw affects FileUtil.java in apache hadoop. It does not affect rhs-hadoop package shipped in Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.

For JBoss Fuse 6.3 and 7 standalone, while they ship vulnerable artifact via camel-hbase, camel-hdfs2 (fuse 6.3) and camel-hdfs2 (fuse 7), there's no invocation on the flawed code that could lead to an unzip operation. So fuse 6.3, 7 standalone are not affected. However FIS 2.0 and Fuse 7 on OpenShift ship vulnerable artifact via maven BOM, so setting fuse as affected for this reason.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1593018#c7)  Andrea Cosentino    2018-10-24 06:19:14 UTC  ``` What is the Hadoop version containing the fix?   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1593018#c8)  Akira Ajisaka    2018-10-30 05:59:50 UTC  ``` Now the CVE list for Apache Hadoop is out. <https://hadoop.apache.org/cve_list.html>  Please check the list for the versions containing the fix.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1593018#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-11-14 21:17:58 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Fuse 7.5.0  Via RHSA-2019:3892 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3892](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A3892)   ``` |  |

# Hadoop CVE List

This page lists security fixes that the Hadoop PMC felt warranted a CVE. If you think something is missing from this list or if you think the set of impacted or fixed versions is incomplete then please [ask on the Security list](/mailing_lists.html#Security).

CVEs are presented in most-recent-first order of announcement.

## [CVE-2023-26031](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-26031) Privilege escalation in Apache Haoop Yarn container-executor binary on Linux systems

Relative library resolution in linux container-executor binary in Apache Hadoop 3.3.1-3.3.4 on Linux allows local user to gain root privileges. If the YARN cluster is accepting work from remote (authenticated) users, this MAY permit remote users to gain root privileges.

Hadoop 3.3.0 updated the [YARN Secure Containers](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/SecureContainer.html) to add a feature for executing user-submitted applications in isolated linux containers.

The native binary HADOOP\_HOME/bin/container-executor is used to launch these containers; it must be owned by root and have the suid bit set in order for the YARN processes to run the containers as the specific users submitting the jobs.

The patch [YARN-10495](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-10495) “make the rpath of container-executor configurable” modified the library loading path for loading .so files from `$ORIGIN/` to `$ORIGIN/:../lib/native/`. This is the a path through which libcrypto.so is located. Thus it is is possible for a user with reduced privileges to install a malicious libcrypto library into a path to which they have write access, invoke the container-executor command, and have their modified library executed as root.
If the YARN cluster is accepting work from remote (authenticated) users, and these users’ submitted job are executed in the physical host, rather than a container, then the CVE permits remote users to gain root privileges.

The fix for the vulnerability is to revert the change, which is done in [YARN-11441](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-11441), “Revert YARN-10495”. This patch is in hadoop-3.3.5.

To determine whether a version of container-executor is vulnerable, use the readelf command. If the RUNPATH or RPATH value contains the relative path `./lib/native/` then it is at risk

```
$ readelf -d container-executor|grep 'RUNPATH\|RPATH'
0x000000000000001d (RUNPATH)            Library runpath: [$ORIGIN/:../lib/native/]

```

If it does not, then it is safe:

```
$ readelf -d container-executor|grep 'RUNPATH\|RPATH'
0x000000000000001d (RUNPATH)            Library runpath: [$ORIGIN/]

```

For an at-risk version of container-executor to enable privilege escalation, the owner must be root and the suid bit must be set

```
$ ls -laF /opt/hadoop/bin/container-executor
---Sr-s---. 1 root hadoop 802968 May 9 20:21 /opt/hadoop/bin/container-executor

```

A safe installation lacks the suid bit; ideally is also not owned by root.

```
$ ls -laF /opt/hadoop/bin/container-executor
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 yarn hadoop 802968 May 9 20:21 /opt/hadoop/bin/container-executor

```

This configuration does not support Yarn Secure Containers, but all other hadoop services, including YARN job execution outside secure containers continue to work.

## [CVE-2022-25168](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-25168) Command injection in org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileUtil.unTarUsingTar

Apache Hadoop’s FileUtil.unTar(File, File) API does not escape the
input file name before being passed to the shell. An attacker can
inject arbitrary commands.

This is only used in Hadoop 3.3
InMemoryAliasMap.completeBootstrapTransfer, which is only ever run by
a local user.

It has been used in Hadoop 2.x for yarn localization, which does
enable remote code execution.

It is used in Apache Spark, from the SQL command ADD ARCHIVE. As the
ADD ARCHIVE command adds new binaries to the classpath, being able to
execute shell scripts does not confer new permissions to the caller.

SPARK-38305. “Check existence of file before untarring/zipping”, which
is included in 3.3.0, 3.1.4, 3.2.2, prevents shell commands being
executed, regardless of which version of the hadoop libraries are in
use.

## [CVE-2022-26612](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-26612) Arbitrary file write during untar on Windows

In Apache Hadoop, The `unTar` function uses `unTarUsingJava` function on Windows and the built-in tar utility on Unix and other OSes. As a result, a TAR entry may create a symlink under the expected extraction directory which points to an external directory. A subsequent TAR entry may extract an arbitrary file into the external directory using the symlink name. This however would be caught by the same `targetDirPath` check on Unix because of the `getCanonicalPath` call. However on Windows, `getCanonicalPath` doesn’t resolve symbolic links, which bypasses the check. `unpackEntries` during TAR extraction follows symbolic links which allows writing outside expected base directory on Windows.

Users of the affected versions should apply either of the following mitigations:

* Do not run any of the YARN daemons as a user possessing the permissions to create symlinks on Windows.
* Do not use symlinks in the tar file.

* **Versions affected**: Versions below 3.2.3, 3.3.2
* **Fixed versions**: 3.2.3, 3.3.3, 3.4 onwards
* **Impact**: file write to arbitrary path in Windows
* **Reporter**: A member of GitHub Security Lab, [Jaroslav LobaÄevski](https://github.com/JarLob)

## [CVE-2020-9492](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9492) Apache Hadoop Potential privilege escalation

WebHDFS client might send SPNEGO authorization header to remote URL
without proper verification. A crafty user can trigger services to
send server credentials to a webhdfs path for capturing the service
principal.

Users of the affected versions should apply either of the following mitigations:

* Set different http signature secrets and use dedicated hosts for each privileged impersonation service (such as HiveServer2).
* Upgrade to 3.3.0, 3.2.2, 3.1.4, 2.10.1, or newer with TLS encryption enabled and configure dfs.http.policy to HTTPS\_ONLY.

## [CVE-2018-11768](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11768) Apache Hadoop HDFS FSImage Corruption

There is a mismatch in the size of the fields used to store user/group
information between memory and disk representation. This causes the user/group
information to be corrupted across storing in fsimage and reading back from
fsimage.

This vulnerability fix contains a fsimage layout change, so once the image is
saved in the new layout format you cannot go back to a version that doesnât
support the newer layout. This means that once 2.7.x users upgraded to the
fixed version, they cannot downgrade to 2.7.x because there is no fixed version
in 2.7.x. We suggest downgrade to 2.8.5 or upper version that contains the
vulnerability fix.

* **Versions affected**: 3.1.0 to 3.1.1, 3.0.0-alpha1 to 3.0.3, 2.9.0 to 2.9.1, 2.0.0-alpha to 2.8.4

## [CVE-2018-1296](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1296) Apache Hadoop HDFS Permissive listXAttr Authorization

HDFS exposes extended attribute key/value pairs during listXAttrs,
verifying only path-level search access to the directory rather than
path-level read permission to the referent. This affects features that
store sensitive data in extended attributes, such as HDFS encryption
secrets.

## [CVE-2017-15718](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-15718) Apache Hadoop YARN NodeManager vulnerability

In Apache Hadoop 2.7.3 and 2.7.4, the security fix for CVE-2016-3086 is incomplete.
The YARN NodeManager can leak the password for credential store provider
used by the NodeManager to YARN Applications.

If you use the CredentialProvider feature to encrypt passwords used in
NodeManager configs, it may be possible for any Container launched
by that NodeManager to gain access to the encryption password.
The other passwords themselves are not directly exposed.

## [CVE-2017-3166](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-3166) Apache Hadoop Privilege escalation vulnerability

In a cluster where the YARN user has been granted access to all HDFS
encryption keys, if a file in an encryption zone with access permissions
that make it world readable is localized via YARN’s localization mechanism,
e.g. via the MapReduce distributed cache, that file will be stored
in a world-readable location and shared freely with any application
that requests to localize that file, no matter who the application owner
is or whether that user should be allowed to access files from the
target encryption zone.

* **Versions affected**: 3.0.0-alpha1 - 3.0.0-alpha3 , 2.7.0 to 2.7.3, 2.6.1-2.6.5

# Thirdparty vulnerabilities

The following section describes thirdparty vulnerabilities that may be of interest to Hadoop users. Please contact the respective project owners for details.

## [CVE-2021-44228](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44228) Log4Shell Vulnerability

It is understood that the log4shell vulnerability CVE-2021-44228 impacts log4j2. Hadoop, as of 3.3.x depends on log4j 1.x, which is **NOT** susceptible to the attack. Once we migrate over to log4j2, we will adopt a version that is not susceptible to the attack, too. Therefore, no ASF version of Hadoop has ever been vulnerable. Third party products and applications based on Hadoop *may* be vulnerable, please consult the vendor or the project owner.

* **Versions affected**: N/A

## [CVE-2021-4104](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-4104) Log4Shell Vulnerability

JMSAppender in Log4j 1.2, used by all versions of Apache Hadoop, is vulnerable to the Log4Shell attack in a similar fashion to CVE-2021-44228. However, the JMSAppender is not the default configuration shipped in Hadoop. When JMSAppender is not enabled, Hadoop is not vulnerable to the attack.

To mitigate the risk, you can remove JMSAppender from the log4j-1.2.17.jar artifact yourself following the instructions in this [link](http://slf4j.org/log4shell.html).
