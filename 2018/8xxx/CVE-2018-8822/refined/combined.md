Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-5715

    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
    processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
    controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes
    running on the system.

    This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 2 (branch
    target injection) and is mitigated for the x86 architecture (amd64
    and i386) by using the "retpoline" compiler feature which allows
    indirect branches to be isolated from speculative execution.

CVE-2017-5753

    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
    processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
    controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes
    running on the system.

    This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 1
    (bounds-check bypass) and is mitigated by identifying vulnerable
    code sections (array bounds checking followed by array access) and
    replacing the array access with the speculation-safe
    array_index_nospec() function.

    More use sites will be added over time.

CVE-2017-17975

    Tuba Yavuz reported a use-after-free flaw in the USBTV007
    audio-video grabber driver. A local user could use this for denial
    of service by triggering failure of audio registration.

CVE-2017-18193

    Yunlei He reported that the f2fs implementation does not properly
    handle extent trees, allowing a local user to cause a denial of
    service via an application with multiple threads.

CVE-2017-18216

    Alex Chen reported that the OCFS2 filesystem failed to hold a
    necessary lock during nodemanager sysfs file operations,
    potentially leading to a null pointer dereference.  A local user
    could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-18218

    Jun He reported a user-after-free flaw in the Hisilicon HNS ethernet
    driver. A local user could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-18222

    It was reported that the Hisilicon Network Subsystem (HNS) driver
    implementation does not properly handle ethtool private flags. A
    local user could use this for denial of service or possibly have
    other impact.

CVE-2017-18224

    Alex Chen reported that the OCFS2 filesystem omits the use of a
    semaphore and consequently has a race condition for access to the
    extent tree during read operations in DIRECT mode. A local user
    could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-18241

    Yunlei He reported that the f2fs implementation does not properly
    initialise its state if the "noflush_merge" mount option is used.
    A local user with access to a filesystem mounted with this option
    could use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2017-18257

    It was reported that the f2fs implementation is prone to an infinite
    loop caused by an integer overflow in the __get_data_block()
    function. A local user can use this for denial of service via
    crafted use of the open and fallocate system calls with an
    FS_IOC_FIEMAP ioctl.

CVE-2018-1065

    The syzkaller tool found a NULL pointer dereference flaw in the
    netfilter subsystem when handling certain malformed iptables
    rulesets. A local user with the CAP_NET_RAW or CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability (in any user namespace) could use this to cause a denial
    of service. Debian disables unprivileged user namespaces by default.

CVE-2018-1066

    Dan Aloni reported to Red Hat that the CIFS client implementation
    would dereference a null pointer if the server sent an invalid
    response during NTLMSSP setup negotiation.  This could be used
    by a malicious server for denial of service.

CVE-2018-1068

    The syzkaller tool found that the 32-bit compatibility layer of
    ebtables did not sufficiently validate offset values. On a 64-bit
    kernel, a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user
    namespace) could use this to overwrite kernel memory, possibly
    leading to privilege escalation. Debian disables unprivileged user
    namespaces by default.

CVE-2018-1092

    Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image would
    trigger a null dereference when mounted.  A local user able
    to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this for denial of
    service.

CVE-2018-1093

    Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image could trigger
    an out-of-bounds read in the ext4_valid_block_bitmap() function. A
    local user able to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this for
    denial of service.

CVE-2018-1108

    Jann Horn reported that crng_ready() does not properly handle the
    crng_init variable states and the RNG could be treated as
    cryptographically safe too early after system boot.

CVE-2018-5803

    Alexey Kodanev reported that the SCTP protocol did not range-check
    the length of chunks to be created.  A local or remote user could
    use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2018-7480

    Hou Tao discovered a double-free flaw in the blkcg_init_queue()
    function in block/blk-cgroup.c. A local user could use this to cause
    a denial of service or have other impact.

CVE-2018-7566

    Fan LongFei reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound)
    sequencer core, between write and ioctl operations.  This could
    lead to an out-of-bounds access or use-after-free.  A local user
    with access to a sequencer device could use this for denial of
    service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-7740

    Nic Losby reported that the hugetlbfs filesystem's mmap operation
    did not properly range-check the file offset.  A local user with
    access to files on a hugetlbfs filesystem could use this to cause
    a denial of service.

CVE-2018-7757

    Jason Yan reported a memory leak in the SAS (Serial-Attached
    SCSI) subsystem.  A local user on a system with SAS devices
    could use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2018-7995

    Seunghun Han reported a race condition in the x86 MCE
    (Machine Check Exception) driver.  This is unlikely to have
    any security impact.

CVE-2018-8087

    A memory leak flaw was found in the hwsim_new_radio_nl() function in
    the simulated radio testing tool driver for mac80211, allowing a
    local user to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2018-8781

    Eyal Itkin reported that the udl (DisplayLink) driver's mmap
    operation did not properly range-check the file offset.  A local
    user with access to a udl framebuffer device could exploit this to
    overwrite kernel memory, leading to privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-8822

    Dr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported that the ncpfs client
    implementation did not validate reply lengths from the server.  An
    ncpfs server could use this to cause a denial of service or
    remote code execution in the client.

CVE-2018-10323

    Wen Xu reported a NULL pointer dereference flaw in the
    xfs_bmapi_write() function triggered when mounting and operating a
    crafted xfs filesystem image. A local user able to mount arbitrary
    filesystems could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-1000199

    Andy Lutomirski discovered that the ptrace subsystem did not
    sufficiently validate hardware breakpoint settings.  Local users
    can use this to cause a denial of service, or possibly for
    privilege escalation, on x86 (amd64 and i386) and possibly other
    architectures.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.88-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

updates for the Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu

16.04 LTS for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

Jann Horn and Ken Johnson discovered that microprocessors utilizing

speculative execution of a memory read may allow unauthorized memory

reads via a sidechannel attack. This flaw is known as Spectre

Variant 4. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information, including kernel memory. ([CVE-2018-3639](/security/CVE-2018-3639))

Tuba Yavuz discovered that a double-free error existed in the USBTV007

driver of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2017-17975](/security/CVE-2017-17975))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the F2FS implementation

in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-18193](/security/CVE-2017-18193))

It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the Hisilicon HNS

Ethernet Device driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this

Please note that fully mitigating CVE-2018-3639 (Spectre Variant 4)

may require corresponding processor microcode/firmware updates or,

in virtual environments, hypervisor updates. On i386 and amd64

architectures, the SSBD feature is required to enable the kernel

mitigations. BIOS vendors will be making updates available for Intel

processors that implement SSBD and Ubuntu is working with Intel to

provide future microcode updates. Ubuntu users with a processor from

a different vendor should contact the vendor to identify necessary

firmware updates. Ubuntu provided corresponding QEMU updates for users

of self-hosted virtual environments in USN 3651-1. Ubuntu users in

cloud environments should contact the cloud provider to confirm that

the hypervisor has been updated to expose the new CPU features to

virtual machines.

# USN-3653-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

22 May 2018

Several security issues were addressed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Jann Horn and Ken Johnson discovered that microprocessors utilizing

speculative execution of a memory read may allow unauthorized memory

reads via a sidechannel attack. This flaw is known as Spectre

Variant 4. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information, including kernel memory. ([CVE-2018-3639](/security/CVE-2018-3639))

It was discovered that the netlink subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

properly restrict observations of netlink messages to the appropriate net

namespace. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information

(kernel netlink traffic). ([CVE-2017-17449](/security/CVE-2017-17449))

Tuba Yavuz discovered that a double-free error existed in the USBTV007

driver of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2017-17975](/security/CVE-2017-17975))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Device Mapper

component of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-18203](/security/CVE-2017-18203))

It was discovered that an infinite loop could occur in the madvise(2)

implementation in the Linux kernel in certain circumstances. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system hang).

([CVE-2017-18208](/security/CVE-2017-18208))

Silvio Cesare discovered a buffer overwrite existed in the NCPFS

implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker controlling a

malicious NCPFS server could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-8822](/security/CVE-2018-8822))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 17.10

* [linux-image-4.13.0-43-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.13.0-43.48](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.13.0-43.48)
* [linux-image-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.13.0.43.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.13.0-43.48)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-43-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.13.0-43.48](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.13.0-43.48)
* [linux-image-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.13.0.43.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.13.0-43.48)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-43-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.13.0-43.48](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.13.0-43.48)
* [linux-image-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.13.0.43.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.13.0-43.48)

Please note that fully mitigating CVE-2018-3639 (Spectre Variant 4)

may require corresponding processor microcode/firmware updates or,

in virtual environments, hypervisor updates. On i386 and amd64

architectures, the SSBD feature is required to enable the kernel

mitigations. BIOS vendors will be making updates available for Intel

processors that implement SSBD and Ubuntu is working with Intel to

provide future microcode updates. Ubuntu users with a processor from

a different vendor should contact the vendor to identify necessary

firmware updates. Ubuntu provided corresponding QEMU updates for users

of self-hosted virtual environments in USN 3651-1. Ubuntu users in

cloud environments should contact the cloud provider to confirm that

the hypervisor has been updated to expose the new CPU features to

virtual machines.

Please note that fully mitigating CVE-2018-3639 (Spectre Variant 4)

may require corresponding processor microcode/firmware updates or,

in virtual environments, hypervisor updates. On i386 and amd64

architectures, the SSBD feature is required to enable the kernel

mitigations. BIOS vendors will be making updates available for Intel

processors that implement SSBD and Ubuntu is working with Intel to

provide future microcode updates. Ubuntu users with a processor from

a different vendor should contact the vendor to identify necessary

firmware updates. Ubuntu provided corresponding QEMU updates for users

of self-hosted virtual environments in USN 3651-1. Ubuntu users in

cloud environments should contact the cloud provider to confirm that

the hypervisor has been updated to expose the new CPU features to

virtual machines.

It was 4 years ago for CVE-2018-8822, where ncpfs moved from being good
into the "staging" tree due to quality / maintenance issues.

I got information back from Mitre on this topic.

This thread from you and Moritz in 2014 set the Mitre non-assignment policy regarding drivers/staging/

	<https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/03/05/6>

If this has changed in meantime (e.g. that security issues in the
staging tree are CVE worthy), we can ask Mitre to allow assigning to
staging drivers again.

Ciao, Marcus

```
If the server is malicious then *bytes_read could be larger than the
size of the "target" buffer.  It would lead to memory corruption when we
do the memcpy().

# USN-3655-2: Linux kernel (Trusty HWE) vulnerabilities

22 May 2018

Several security issues were addressed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-trusty](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-trusty) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty for Precise ESM

## Details

USN-3655-1 fixed vulnerabilities and added mitigations in the Linux

kernel for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding

updates for the Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu

14.04 LTS for Ubuntu 12.04 ESM.

Jann Horn and Ken Johnson discovered that microprocessors utilizing

speculative execution of a memory read may allow unauthorized memory

reads via a sidechannel attack. This flaw is known as Spectre

Variant 4. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information, including kernel memory. ([CVE-2018-3639](/security/CVE-2018-3639))

Jan H. SchÃ¶nherr discovered that the Xen subsystem did not properly handle

block IO merges correctly in some situations. An attacker in a guest vm

could use this to cause a denial of service (host crash) or possibly gain

administrative privileges in the host. ([CVE-2017-12134](/security/CVE-2017-12134))

It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIP Protocol implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate HID connection setup information. An

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-13220](/security/CVE-2017-13220))

It was discovered that a buffer overread vulnerability existed in the

keyring subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use

this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2017-13305](/security/CVE-2017-13305))

It was discovered that the netlink subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

properly restrict observations of netlink messages to the appropriate net

namespace. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information

(kernel netlink traffic). ([CVE-2017-17449](/security/CVE-2017-17449))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the i8042 serial device

driver implementation in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-18079](/security/CVE-2017-18079))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Device Mapper

component of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-18203](/security/CVE-2017-18203))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the OCFS2 file system

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock). ([CVE-2017-18204](/security/CVE-2017-18204))

It was discovered that an infinite loop could occur in the madvise(2)

implementation in the Linux kernel in certain circumstances. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system hang).

([CVE-2017-18208](/security/CVE-2017-18208))

Kefeng Wang discovered that a race condition existed in the memory locking

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2017-18221](/security/CVE-2017-18221))

Silvio Cesare discovered a buffer overwrite existed in the NCPFS

implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker controlling a

malicious NCPFS server could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-8822](/security/CVE-2018-8822))

Please note that fully mitigating CVE-2018-3639 (Spectre Variant 4)

may require corresponding processor microcode/firmware updates or,

in virtual environments, hypervisor updates. On i386 and amd64

architectures, the SSBD feature is required to enable the kernel

mitigations. BIOS vendors will be making updates available for Intel

processors that implement SSBD. Ubuntu users with a processor from

a different vendor should contact the vendor to identify necessary

firmware updates. Ubuntu users in cloud environments should contact

the cloud provider to confirm that the hypervisor has been updated

to expose the new CPU features to virtual machines.

                 CVE-2018-1000199

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2015-9016

    Ming Lei reported a race condition in the multiqueue block layer
    (blk-mq).  On a system with a driver using blk-mq (mtip32xx,
    null_blk, or virtio_blk), a local user might be able to use this
    for denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-0861

    Robb Glasser reported a potential use-after-free in the ALSA (sound)
    PCM core.  We believe this was not possible in practice.

CVE-2017-5715

    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
    processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
    controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes
    running on the system.

    This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 2 (branch
    target injection) and is mitigated for the x86 architecture (amd64
    and i386) by using the "retpoline" compiler feature which allows
    indirect branches to be isolated from speculative execution.

CVE-2017-5753

    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
    processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
    controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes
    running on the system.

    This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 1
    (bounds-check bypass) and is mitigated by identifying vulnerable
    code sections (array bounds checking followed by array access) and
    replacing the array access with the speculation-safe
    array_index_nospec() function.

    More use sites will be added over time.

CVE-2017-13166

    A bug in the 32-bit compatibility layer of the v4l2 ioctl handling
    code has been found. Memory protections ensuring user-provided
    buffers always point to userland memory were disabled, allowing
    destination addresses to be in kernel space. On a 64-bit kernel a
    local user with access to a suitable video device can exploit this
    to overwrite kernel memory, leading to privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-13220

    Al Viro reported that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation could
    dereference a pointer before performing the necessary type check.
    A local user could use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2017-16526

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the UWB subsystem may dereference
    an invalid pointer in an error case.  A local user might be able
    to use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-16911

    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP vhci_hcd driver exposed
    kernel heap addresses to local users.  This information could aid the
    exploitation of other vulnerabilities.

CVE-2017-16912

    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver failed to
    perform a range check on a received packet header field, leading
    to an out-of-bounds read.  A remote user able to connect to the
    USB/IP server could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-16913

    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver failed to
    perform a range check on a received packet header field, leading
    to excessive memory allocation.  A remote user able to connect to
    the USB/IP server could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-16914

    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver failed to
    check for an invalid combination of fields in a received packet,
    leading to a null pointer dereference.  A remote user able to
    connect to the USB/IP server could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-18017

    Denys Fedoryshchenko reported that the netfilter xt_TCPMSS module
    failed to validate TCP header lengths, potentially leading to a
    use-after-free.  If this module is loaded, it could be used by a
    remote attacker for denial of service or possibly for code
    execution.

CVE-2017-18203

    Hou Tao reported that there was a race condition in creation and
    deletion of device-mapper (DM) devices.  A local user could
    potentially use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-18216

    Alex Chen reported that the OCFS2 filesystem failed to hold a
    necessary lock during nodemanager sysfs file operations,
    potentially leading to a null pointer dereference.  A local user
    could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-18232

    Jason Yan reported a race condition in the SAS (Serial-Attached
    SCSI) subsystem, between probing and destroying a port.  This
    could lead to a deadlock.  A physically present attacker could
    use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2017-18241

    Yunlei He reported that the f2fs implementation does not properly
    initialise its state if the "noflush_merge" mount option is used.
    A local user with access to a filesystem mounted with this option
    could use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2018-1066

    Dan Aloni reported to Red Hat that the CIFS client implementation
    would dereference a null pointer if the server sent an invalid
    response during NTLMSSP setup negotiation.  This could be used
    by a malicious server for denial of service.

CVE-2018-1068

    The syzkaller tool found that the 32-bit compatibility layer of
    ebtables did not sufficiently validate offset values. On a 64-bit
    kernel, a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user
    namespace) could use this to overwrite kernel memory, possibly
    leading to privilege escalation. Debian disables unprivileged user
    namespaces by default.

CVE-2018-1092

    Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image would
    trigger a null dereference when mounted.  A local user able
    to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this for denial of
    service.

CVE-2018-5332

    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not
    sufficiently validate RDMA requests, leading to an out-of-bounds
    write.  A local attacker on a system with the rds module loaded
    could use this for denial of service or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2018-5333

    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not properly
    handle an error case, leading to a null pointer dereference.  A
    local attacker on a system with the rds module loaded could
    possibly use this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-5750

    Wang Qize reported that the ACPI sbshc driver logged a kernel heap
    address.  This information could aid the exploitation of other
    vulnerabilities.

CVE-2018-5803

    Alexey Kodanev reported that the SCTP protocol did not range-check
    the length of chunks to be created.  A local or remote user could
    use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2018-6927

    Li Jinyue reported that the FUTEX_REQUEUE operation on futexes did
    not check for negative parameter values, which might lead to a
    denial of service or other security impact.

CVE-2018-7492

    The syzkaller tool found that the RDS protocol was lacking a null
    pointer check.  A local attacker on a system with the rds module
    loaded could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-7566

    Fan LongFei reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound)
    sequencer core, between write and ioctl operations.  This could
    lead to an out-of-bounds access or use-after-free.  A local user
    with access to a sequencer device could use this for denial of
    service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-7740

    Nic Losby reported that the hugetlbfs filesystem's mmap operation
    did not properly range-check the file offset.  A local user with
    access to files on a hugetlbfs filesystem could use this to cause
    a denial of service.

CVE-2018-7757

    Jason Yan reported a memory leak in the SAS (Serial-Attached
    SCSI) subsystem.  A local user on a system with SAS devices
    could use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2018-7995

    Seunghun Han reported a race condition in the x86 MCE
    (Machine Check Exception) driver.  This is unlikely to have
    any security impact.

CVE-2018-8781

    Eyal Itkin reported that the udl (DisplayLink) driver's mmap
    operation did not properly range-check the file offset.  A local
    user with access to a udl framebuffer device could exploit this to
    overwrite kernel memory, leading to privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-8822

    Dr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported that the ncpfs client
    implementation did not validate reply lengths from the server.  An
    ncpfs server could use this to cause a denial of service or
    remote code execution in the client.

CVE-2018-1000004

    Luo Quan reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound) sequencer
    core, between multiple ioctl operations.  This could lead to a
    deadlock or use-after-free.  A local user with access to a
    sequencer device could use this for denial of service or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-1000199

    Andy Lutomirski discovered that the ptrace subsystem did not
    sufficiently validate hardware breakpoint settings.  Local users
    can use this to cause a denial of service, or possibly for
    privilege escalation, on x86 (amd64 and i386) and possibly other
    architectures.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.16.56-1.

Debian Bug     : 887106

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-0861

    Robb Glasser reported a potential use-after-free in the ALSA (sound)
    PCM core.  We believe this was not possible in practice.

CVE-2017-5715

    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
    processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
    controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes
    running on the system.

    This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 2 (branch
    target injection) and is mitigated for the x86 architecture (amd64
    and i386) by using the "retpoline" compiler feature which allows
    indirect branches to be isolated from speculative execution.

CVE-2017-13166

    A bug in the 32-bit compatibility layer of the v4l2 ioctl handling
    code has been found.  Memory protections ensuring user-provided
    buffers always point to userland memory were disabled, allowing
    destination addresses to be in kernel space.  On a 64-bit kernel
    (amd64 flavour) a local user with access to a suitable video
    device can exploit this to overwrite kernel memory, leading to
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-16526

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the UWB subsystem may dereference
    an invalid pointer in an error case.  A local user might be able
    to use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-16911

    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP vhci_hcd driver exposed
    kernel heap addresses to local users.  This information could aid the
    exploitation of other vulnerabilities.

CVE-2017-16912

    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver failed to
    perform a range check on a received packet header field, leading
    to an out-of-bounds read.  A remote user able to connect to the
    USB/IP server could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-16913

    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver failed to
    perform a range check on a received packet header field, leading
    to excessive memory allocation.  A remote user able to connect to
    the USB/IP server could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-16914

    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver failed to
    check for an invalid combination of fields in a recieved packet,
    leading to a null pointer dereference.  A remote user able to
    connect to the USB/IP server could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-18017

    Denys Fedoryshchenko reported that the netfilter xt_TCPMSS module
    failed to validate TCP header lengths, potentially leading to a
    use-after-free.  If this module is loaded, it could be used by a
    remote attacker for denial of service or possibly for code
    execution.

CVE-2017-18203

    Hou Tao reported that there was a race condition in creation and
    deletion of device-mapper (DM) devices.  A local user could
    potentially use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-18216

    Alex Chen reported that the OCFS2 filesystem failed to hold a
    necessary lock during nodemanager sysfs file operations,
    potentially leading to a null pointer dereference.  A local user
    could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-1068

    The syzkaller tool found that the 32-bit compatibility layer of
    ebtables did not sufficiently validate offset values.  On a 64-bit
    kernel (amd64 flavour), a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability could use this to overwrite kernel memory, possibly
    leading to privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-1092

    Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image would
    trigger a null dereference when mounted.  A local user able
    to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this for denial of
    service.

CVE-2018-5332

    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not
    sufficiently validate RDMA requests, leading to an out-of-bounds
    write.  A local attacker on a system with the rds module loaded
    could use this for denial of service or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2018-5333

    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not properly
    handle an error case, leading to a null pointer dereference.  A
    local attacker on a system with the rds module loaded could
    possibly use this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-5750

    Wang Qize reported that the ACPI sbshc driver logged a kernel heap
    address.  This information could aid the exploitation of other
    vulnerabilities.

CVE-2018-5803

    Alexey Kodanev reported that the SCTP protocol did not range-check
    the length of chunks to be created.  A local or remote user could
    use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2018-6927

    Li Jinyue reported that the FUTEX_REQUEUE operation on futexes did
    not check for negative parameter values, which might lead to a
    denial of service or other security impact.

CVE-2018-7492

    The syzkaller tool found that the RDS protocol was lacking a null
    pointer check.  A local attacker on a system with the rds module
    loaded could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-7566

    èŒƒé¾™é£ž (Fan LongFei) reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound)
    sequencer core, between write and ioctl operations.  This could
    lead to an out-of-bounds access or use-after-free.  A local user
    with access to a sequencer device could use this for denial of
    service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-7740

    Nic Losby reported that the hugetlbfs filesystem's mmap operation
    did not properly range-check the file offset.  A local user with
    access to files on a hugetlbfs filesystem could use this to cause
    a denial of service.

CVE-2018-7757

    Jason Yan reported a memory leak in the SAS (Serial-Attached
    SCSI) subsystem.  A local user on a system with SAS devices
    could use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2018-7995

    Seunghun Han reported a race condition in the x86 MCE
    (Machine Check Exception) driver.  This is unlikely to have
    any security impact.

CVE-2018-8781

    Eyal Itkin reported that the udl (DisplayLink) driver's mmap
    operation did not properly range-check the file offset.  A local
    user with access to a udl framebuffer device could exploit this to
    overwrite kernel memory, leading to privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-8822

    Dr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported that the ncpfs client
    implementation did not validate reply lengths from the server.  An
    ncpfs server could use this to cause a denial of service or
    remote code execution in the client.

CVE-2018-1000004

    Luo Quan reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound) sequencer
    core, between multiple ioctl operations.  This could lead to a
    deadlock or use-after-free.  A local user with access to a
    sequencer device could use this for denial of service or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-1000199

    Andy Lutomirski discovered that the ptrace subsystem did not
    sufficiently validate hardware breakpoint settings.  Local users
    can use this to cause a denial of service, or possibly for
    privilege escalation, on x86 (amd64 and i386) and possibly other
    architectures.

Additionally, some mitigations for CVE-2017-5753 are included in this
release:

CVE-2017-5753

    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
    processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
    controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes
    running on the system.

    This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 1
    (bounds-check bypass) and is mitigated by identifying vulnerable
    code sections (array bounds checking followed by array access) and
    replacing the array access with the speculation-safe
    array_index_nospec() function.

    More use sites will be added over time.

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
3.2.101-1.  This version also includes bug fixes from upstream versions
up to and including 3.2.101.  It also fixes a regression in the
procfs hidepid option in the previous version (Debian bug #887106).

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.4.0-1090-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2)
  -
  [4.4.0-1090.98](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.4.0-1090.98)
* [linux-image-4.4.0-1093-snapdragon](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-snapdragon)
  -
  [4.4.0-1093.98](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-snapdragon/4.4.0-1093.98)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)

## Packages

* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2

## Details

It was discovered that the netlink subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

properly restrict observations of netlink messages to the appropriate net

namespace. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information

(kernel netlink traffic). ([CVE-2017-17449](/security/CVE-2017-17449))

Tuba Yavuz discovered that a double-free error existed in the USBTV007

driver of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2017-17975](/security/CVE-2017-17975))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Device Mapper

component of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-18203](/security/CVE-2017-18203))

It was discovered that an infinite loop could occur in the madvise(2)

implementation in the Linux kernel in certain circumstances. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system hang).

([CVE-2017-18208](/security/CVE-2017-18208))

Silvio Cesare discovered a buffer overwrite existed in the NCPFS

implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker controlling a

malicious NCPFS server could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-8822](/security/CVE-2018-8822))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 17.10

* [linux-image-4.13.0-1020-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2)
  -
  [4.13.0-1020.21](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.13.0-1020.21)
* [linux-image-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2)
  -
  [4.13.0.1020.18](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.13.0-1020.21)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Jann Horn and Ken Johnson discovered that microprocessors utilizing

speculative execution of a memory read may allow unauthorized memory

reads via a sidechannel attack. This flaw is known as Spectre

Variant 4. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information, including kernel memory. ([CVE-2018-3639](/security/CVE-2018-3639))

Jan H. SchÃ¶nherr discovered that the Xen subsystem did not properly handle

block IO merges correctly in some situations. An attacker in a guest vm

could use this to cause a denial of service (host crash) or possibly gain

administrative privileges in the host. ([CVE-2017-12134](/security/CVE-2017-12134))

It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIP Protocol implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate HID connection setup information. An

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-13220](/security/CVE-2017-13220))

It was discovered that a buffer overread vulnerability existed in the

keyring subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use

this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2017-13305](/security/CVE-2017-13305))

It was discovered that the netlink subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

properly restrict observations of netlink messages to the appropriate net

namespace. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information

(kernel netlink traffic). ([CVE-2017-17449](/security/CVE-2017-17449))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the i8042 serial device

driver implementation in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-18079](/security/CVE-2017-18079))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Device Mapper

component of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-18203](/security/CVE-2017-18203))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the OCFS2 file system

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (kernel deadlock). ([CVE-2017-18204](/security/CVE-2017-18204))

It was discovered that an infinite loop could occur in the madvise(2)

implementation in the Linux kernel in certain circumstances. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system hang).

([CVE-2017-18208](/security/CVE-2017-18208))

Kefeng Wang discovered that a race condition existed in the memory locking

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2017-18221](/security/CVE-2017-18221))

Silvio Cesare discovered a buffer overwrite existed in the NCPFS

implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker controlling a

malicious NCPFS server could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-8822](/security/CVE-2018-8822))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [linux-image-3.13.0-149-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)

Please note that fully mitigating CVE-2018-3639 (Spectre Variant 4)

may require corresponding processor microcode/firmware updates or,

in virtual environments, hypervisor updates. On i386 and amd64

architectures, the SSBD feature is required to enable the kernel

mitigations. BIOS vendors will be making updates available for Intel

processors that implement SSBD and Ubuntu is working with Intel to

provide future microcode updates. Ubuntu users with a processor from

a different vendor should contact the vendor to identify necessary

firmware updates. Ubuntu provided corresponding QEMU updates for users

of self-hosted virtual environments in USN 3651-1. Ubuntu users in

cloud environments should contact the cloud provider to confirm that

the hypervisor has been updated to expose the new CPU features to

virtual machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-azure](/security/cves?package=linux-azure) - Linux kernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems
* [linux-gcp](/security/cves?package=linux-gcp) - Linux kernel for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) systems
* [linux-hwe](/security/cves?package=linux-hwe) - Linux hardware enablement (HWE) kernel
* [linux-oem](/security/cves?package=linux-oem) - Linux kernel for OEM processors

## Details

USN-3653-1 fixed vulnerabilities and added mitigations in the Linux

kernel for Ubuntu 17.10. This update provides the corresponding

updates for the Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu

17.10 for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

Jann Horn and Ken Johnson discovered that microprocessors utilizing

speculative execution of a memory read may allow unauthorized memory

reads via a sidechannel attack. This flaw is known as Spectre

Variant 4. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information, including kernel memory. ([CVE-2018-3639](/security/CVE-2018-3639))

It was discovered that the netlink subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

properly restrict observations of netlink messages to the appropriate net

namespace. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information

(kernel netlink traffic). ([CVE-2017-17449](/security/CVE-2017-17449))

Tuba Yavuz discovered that a double-free error existed in the USBTV007

driver of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2017-17975](/security/CVE-2017-17975))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Device Mapper

component of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-18203](/security/CVE-2017-18203))

It was discovered that an infinite loop could occur in the madvise(2)

implementation in the Linux kernel in certain circumstances. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system hang).

([CVE-2017-18208](/security/CVE-2017-18208))

Silvio Cesare discovered a buffer overwrite existed in the NCPFS

implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker controlling a

malicious NCPFS server could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-8822](/security/CVE-2018-8822))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.13.0-1017-gcp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-gcp)
  -
  [4.13.0-1017.21](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-gcp/4.13.0-1017.21)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-1018-azure](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-azure)
  -
  [4.13.0-1018.21](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-azure/4.13.0-1018.21)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-1028-oem](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-oem)
  -
  [4.13.0-1028.31](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-oem/4.13.0-1028.31)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-43-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.13.0-43.48~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.13.0-43.48~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-43-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.13.0-43.48~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.13.0-43.48~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-43-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.13.0-43.48~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.13.0-43.48~16.04.1)

Please note that fully mitigating CVE-2018-3639 (Spectre Variant 4)

may require corresponding processor microcode/firmware updates or,

in virtual environments, hypervisor updates. On i386 and amd64

architectures, the SSBD feature is required to enable the kernel

mitigations. BIOS vendors will be making updates available for Intel

processors that implement SSBD and Ubuntu is working with Intel to

provide future microcode updates. Ubuntu users with a processor from

a different vendor should contact the vendor to identify necessary

firmware updates. Ubuntu provided corresponding QEMU updates for users

of self-hosted virtual environments in USN 3651-1. Ubuntu users in

cloud environments should contact the cloud provider to confirm that

the hypervisor has been updated to expose the new CPU features to

virtual machines.
