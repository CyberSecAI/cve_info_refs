Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a Local File Include (LFI) issue in Webmin versions 1.840 and 1.880. This occurs because the application allows users to specify an arbitrary file path to be included as a log file.
*   The default configuration of Webmin allows users to view "any file as a log" which bypasses access restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Local File Include (LFI):** The `save_log.cgi` script allows an attacker to specify the `file` parameter, which is then directly included by the application. This bypasses normal access controls on the server's file system.
*   **Weak Default Configuration:** The default setting for "Can view any files as a log?" is set to 'yes'. This makes the system vulnerable out-of-the-box.
*   **Bypassable Referer Check:** While Webmin attempts to use `referer_none=1` to limit access, this can easily be bypassed with a simple `Referer` HTTP header.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker can read any file on the server, including sensitive files such as `/etc/shadow`.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Exposure of sensitive information like usernames, password hashes, and configuration data.
*   **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** By accessing sensitive system files, an attacker could potentially find more vulnerabilities to escalate their privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts an HTTP GET request to the `save_log.cgi` script with the `file` parameter pointing to the desired file. For example:
    `GET /syslog/save_log.cgi?view=1&file=/etc/shadow HTTP/1.1`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access to Webmin:** The attacker needs network access to the Webmin service, typically on port 10000.
*   **Access to Webmin UI:** The attacker needs to be a Webmin user, although with restricted privileges.
*   **Basic Web Request Knowledge:** The attacker must be capable of making a web request with a modified URL.

**Additional details:**

* The vulnerability exists because of the "Can view any files as a log?" setting being enabled by default.
* The advisory notes that the issue has not been patched yet at the time of writing.
* It was also found that the  `referer_none=1` can be bypassed using the `Referer` HTTP header.
* The content provides a detailed timeline of communication with the vendor.
