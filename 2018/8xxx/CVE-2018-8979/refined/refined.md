Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-8979:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in Open-AuditIT Professional 2.1 when creating credentials. This allows an attacker to craft malicious requests that can be executed by an authenticated user without their knowledge.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF:** The application lacks CSRF protection, which is the primary vulnerability being exploited.
- **XSS:** The application is also vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the lack of input sanitization/validation in the `name` and `description` parameters when creating credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **CSRF:**  An attacker could force a logged-in user to perform unwanted actions within the application. Specifically, they could add a credential entry with an XSS payload.
- **XSS:** By combining CSRF and XSS, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to account compromise or further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that submits a request to the vulnerable credentials creation endpoint of Open-AuditIT.
- The attacker uses social engineering to trick the victim into opening the malicious HTML page in their browser while they are logged into Open-AuditIT Professional 2.1.
- Upon opening the page, the form automatically submits, adding a new credential with the attacker's XSS payload injected into the `name` field.
- When the user accesses the credentials page within the application, the stored XSS payload is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft HTML pages and have the ability to send them to a user of the vulnerable application (e.g., via email or chat).
- The targeted victim must be logged in to the Open-AuditIT Professional 2.1 application when the malicious request is submitted.
- The attacker must have knowledge of the vulnerable endpoints and parameters required to make the malicious request.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability was found in Open-AuditIT Professional version 2.1.
- The blog post provides a proof of concept (PoC) HTML code that can be used to exploit this vulnerability, combining CSRF with an XSS payload.
- The vulnerable parameters include `data[attributes][name]` and `data[attributes][description]`.
- The author of the exploit, Nilesh Sapariya, chained the CSRF vulnerability with XSS, and assigned the following CVE IDs:
    - CVE-2018-8903 for Stored XSS
    - CVE-2018-8979 for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- The exploit code includes an image tag `<img>` with an `onerror` event handler used for the XSS payload: `<img src=x onerror=alert('hacked');>`.
