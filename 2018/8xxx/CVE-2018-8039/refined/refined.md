{
  "CVE-2018-8039": {
    "description": "The content describes a vulnerability in apache-cxf where TLS hostname verification does not work correctly with com.sun.net.ssl.*. When CXF is configured to use the com.sun.net.ssl implementation through a system property, the default HostnameVerifier implementation doesn't implement the necessary method and the resulting exception is not properly propagated. This leaves CXF clients vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "affected_components": [
      "apache-cxf"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Improper exception handling in Apache CXF when using the com.sun.net.ssl implementation for TLS hostname verification.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect TLS hostname verification.",
      "Man-in-the-middle vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "A man-in-the-middle attacker can potentially intercept and modify communications between the CXF client and server due to improper hostname verification.",
    "attack_vector": "Network-based, an attacker would need to be positioned on the network path between the client and server",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker positioned on the network can exploit this vulnerability. The attacker would need to manipulate the network in order to perform a man-in-the-middle attack",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs when CXF is configured to use the com.sun.net.ssl implementation through the 'java.protocol.handler.pkgs' system property. This vulnerability is addressed in  Apache CXF versions 3.2.5 and 3.1.16"
