```
Support the OpenSSL “pass zero for strlen” when setting X.509 hostnames.

BoringSSL does not generally support this quirk but, in this case, we
didn't make it a fatal error and it's instead a silent omission of
hostname checking. This doesn't affect Chrome but, in case something is
using BoringSSL and using this trick, this change makes it safe.

# BoringSSL

BoringSSL is a fork of OpenSSL that is designed to meet Google's needs.

Although BoringSSL is an open source project, it is not intended for general use, as OpenSSL is. We don't recommend that third parties depend upon it. Doing so is likely to be frustrating because there are no guarantees of API or ABI stability.

Programs ship their own copies of BoringSSL when they use it and we update everything as needed when deciding to make API changes. This allows us to mostly avoid compromises in the name of compatibility. It works for us, but it may not work for you.

BoringSSL arose because Google used OpenSSL for many years in various ways and, over time, built up a large number of patches that were maintained while tracking upstream OpenSSL. As Google's product portfolio became more complex, more copies of OpenSSL sprung up and the effort involved in maintaining all these patches in multiple places was growing steadily.

Currently BoringSSL is the SSL library in Chrome/Chromium, Android (but it's not part of the NDK) and a number of other apps/programs.

=== Content from ftp.openbsd.org_18e1bb1b_20250125_013657.html ===
We have released LibreSSL 2.7.1, which will be arriving in the
LibreSSL directory of your local OpenBSD mirror soon. This is the second
release from the 2.7 series, which will be part of OpenBSD 6.3.
It includes the following changes from 2.7.0
\* Fixed a bug in int\_x509\_param\_set\_hosts, calling strlen() if name
length provided is 0 to match the OpenSSL behaviour. Issue noticed
by Christian Heimes
\* Fixed builds macOS 10.11 and older.
LibreSSL 2.7.1 also includes:
\* Added support for many OpenSSL 1.0.2 and 1.1 APIs, based on
observations of real-world usage in applications. These are
implemented in parallel with existing OpenSSL 1.0.1 APIs - visibility
changes have not been made to existing structs, allowing code written
for older OpenSSL APIs to continue working.
\* Extensive corrections, improvements, and additions to the
API documentation, including new public APIs from OpenSSL that had
no pre-existing documentation.
\* Added support for automatic library initialization in libcrypto,
libssl, and libtls. Support for pthread\_once or a compatible
equivalent is now required of the target operating system. As a
side-effect, minimum Windows support is Vista or higher.
\* Converted more packet handling methods to CBB, which improves
resiliency when generating TLS messages.
\* Completed TLS extension handling rewrite, improving consistency of
checks for malformed and duplicate extensions.
\* Rewrote ASN1\_TYPE\_{get,set}\_octetstring() using templated ASN.1.
This removes the last remaining use of the old M\_ASN1\_\* macros
(asn1\_mac.h) from API that needs to continue to exist.
\* Added support for client-side session resumption in libtls.
A libtls client can specify a session file descriptor (a regular
file with appropriate ownership and permissions) and libtls will
manage reading and writing of session data across TLS handshakes.
\* Improved support for strict alignment on ARMv7 architectures,
conditionally enabling assembly in those cases.
\* Fixed a memory leak in libtls when reusing a tls\_config.
\* Merged more DTLS support into the regular TLS code path, removing
duplicated code.
\* Many improvements to Windows Cmake-based builds and tests,
especially when targeting Visual Studio.
The LibreSSL project continues improvement of the codebase to reflect modern,
safe programming practices. We welcome feedback and improvements from the
broader community. Thanks to all of the contributors who helped make this
release possible.
