## Security Notices

1. [[CVE-2018-8092](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-29v9-2fpx-j5g9 "CVE-2018-8092")] Closed the possibility of a CSV injection with exported contact lists - <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/CSV_Injection> (Reported by [@joanbono](https://github.com/joanbono) with Accenture’s Prague TVM Team)
2. [[CVE-2018-8071](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5w74-jx7m-x6hv "CVE-2018-8071")] Closed a XSS vulnerability injected into the UI through the title of a dashboard widget (Reported by [@joanbono](https://github.com/joanbono) with Accenture’s Prague TVM Team)
3. [[CVE-2018-8071](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5w74-jx7m-x6hv "CVE-2018-8071")] Closed a XSS vulnerability injected into the UI through a theme config file (Reported by [@joanbono](https://github.com/joanbono) with Accenture’s Prague TVM Team)
4. [[CVE-2018-10189](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vfxj-qg93-7wwc "CVE-2018-10189")] Closed the possibility of hijacking sessions due to tracking contacts by an auto-incremented ID. This allowed 3rd party to systematically emulate sessions for contacts which could allow them to glean information about the contacts through a form leveraging progressive profiling. Contacts are now tracked by a unique device ID although the old cookies are still made available to the browser for BC purposes. (Reported by [@micschk](https://github.com/micschk)).

**Note:** The feature `Identify visitor by tracking url` is still subject to vulnerability number 4 above. New installations now have it disabled by default but existing installations had it enabled. Therefore, if you are not using this feature, have the email custom field set as publicly updatable, and are leveraging form progressive profiling, please disable `Identify visitor by tracking url` in Mautic's configuration's Tracking Settings.

(CVEs are pending)

# CSV Injection

**Author:** Timo Goosen, Albinowax

**Contributor(s):** kingthorin

CSV Injection, also known as Formula Injection, occurs when websites
embed untrusted input inside CSV files.

When a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc
is used to open a CSV, any cells starting with `=` will be interpreted
by the software as a formula. Maliciously crafted formulas can be used
for three key attacks:

* Hijacking the user’s computer by exploiting vulnerabilities in the spreadsheet software, such as CVE-2014-3524.
* Hijacking the user’s computer by exploiting the user’s tendency to ignore security warnings in spreadsheets that they downloaded from their own website.
* Exfiltrating contents from the spreadsheet, or other open spreadsheets.

This attack is difficult to mitigate, and explicitly disallowed from
quite a few bug bounty programs. To remediate it, ensure that no cells
begin with any of the following characters:

* Equals to (`=`)
* Plus (`+`)
* Minus (`-`)
* At (`@`)
* Tab (`0x09`)
* Carriage return (`0x0D`)

Keep in mind that it is not sufficient to make sure that the untrusted user input does not start with these characters. You also need to take care of the field separator (e.g., ‘`,`’, or ‘`;`’) and quotes (e.g., `'`, or `"`), as attackers could use this to start a new cell and then have the dangerous character in the middle of the user input, but at the beginning of a cell.

Alternatively, apply the following sanitization to each field of the CSV, so that their content will be read as text by the spreadsheet editor:

* Wrap each cell field in double quotes
* Prepend each cell field with a single quote
* Escape every double quote using an additional double quote

Two examples:

| Input | Escaped Output |
| --- | --- |
| `=1+2";=1+2` | `"'=1+2"";=1+2"` |
| `=1+2'" ;,=1+2` | `"'=1+2'"" ;,=1+2"` |
