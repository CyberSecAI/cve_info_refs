Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of data when exporting contact lists to CSV format. Specifically, the application did not prevent the inclusion of characters that, when interpreted by spreadsheet software, would be treated as formulas.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSV Injection (also known as Formula Injection):  The application allows the inclusion of characters such as `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, Tab (`0x09`), and Carriage Return (`0x0D`) in exported CSV data without proper sanitization. This allows these characters to be interpreted as the start of a formula by spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Hijacking the user's computer**: Maliciously crafted formulas could exploit vulnerabilities in the spreadsheet software (e.g., CVE-2014-3524).
- **Social engineering**: Attackers can exploit the user's trust in files downloaded from their own website, leading them to ignore security warnings in spreadsheets.
- **Data exfiltration:** Attackers can use formulas to extract contents from the opened spreadsheet or other open spreadsheets.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves exporting contact lists from the Mautic application. An attacker could manipulate data within the application such that when this data is exported into a CSV file, it contains malicious formulas. A user would then need to open the crafted CSV file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to insert malicious data into the contact list fields within the Mautic application, or manipulate the export process to inject such content.
- The user must then download and open the crafted CSV file.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Mautic versions prior to 2.13.0.
- The vulnerability was reported by @joanbono with Accentureâ€™s Prague TVM Team
- The fix involved sanitizing each cell field of the CSV so that their content is read as text by the spreadsheet editor. This is accomplished by wrapping each cell field in double quotes, prepending each cell field with a single quote, and escaping every double quote using an additional double quote.
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-1236.
- The Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) score for this vulnerability is 0.271%.
