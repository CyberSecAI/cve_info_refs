  "CVE-2018-8945": {
    "description": "The `bfd_section_from_shdr` function in `elf.c` in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.30, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via a large attribute section, or crafted executable file to cause a crash.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      {
        "root_cause": "An attacker could exploit this with a crafted executable file to cause a crash due to an issue in the `bfd_section_from_shdr()` function.",
        "weaknesses": [
           "Invalid memory access",
          "NULL pointer dereference",
           "heap-based buffer over-read",
           "Integer overflow"

          "Processing of a crafted ELF, object, or binary file using binutils"
        ],
        "required_capabilities": "An attacker can cause a crash by enticing a user to compile/execute a specially-crafted file.",
         "details": "The vulnerability exists in the `elf.c:bfd_section_from_shdr()` function in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd). This can be triggered with objcopy, objdump, or other utilities that utilize the BFD library."
