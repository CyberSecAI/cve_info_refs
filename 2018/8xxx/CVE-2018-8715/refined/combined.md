### Description

Palo Alto Networks makes use of a 3rd-party component impacted by CVE-2018-8715. This issue has been confirmed to present a risk for denial of service to the PAN-OS Management Web Interface. (Ref # PAN-93089, CVE-2018-8715)

A specially crafted HTTP POST request with an invalid “If-modified" header field may cause a NULL dereference and cause a denial of service condition. This vulnerability can be triggered without login or authentication and could result in a crash of the management service.

This issue affects PAN-OS 6.1.20 and earlier, PAN-OS 7.1.16 and earlier, PAN-OS 8.0.9 and earlier, and PAN-OS 8.1.0. Global Protect is NOT affected.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| PAN-OS 8.1 | None | >= 8.1.1 |
| PAN-OS 8.0 | <= 8.0.9 | >= 8.0.10 |
| PAN-OS 7.1 | <= 7.1.16 | >= 7.1.17 |
| PAN-OS 6.1 | <= 6.1.20 | >= 6.1.21 |

### Severity: HIGH

CVSSv3.1
Base Score:
8.1 ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://cvssjs.github.io/#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H))

### Weakness Type

[CWE-287 Improper Authentication](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/287 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/287")

### Solution

PAN-OS 6.1.21 and later, PAN-OS 7.1.17 and later, PAN-OS 8.0.10 and later, and PAN-OS 8.1.1 and later.

### Workarounds and Mitigations

This issue affects the web-based management interface of PAN-OS and is strongly mitigated by following best practices for securing the management interface of PAN-OS. Our best practices guidelines reduce the exposure of the management interface to potential attackers. Please review the Best Practices for Securing Administrative Access in the PAN-OS technical documentation, available at: <https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/documentation/80/pan-os/pan-os/getting-started/best-practices-for-securing-administrative-access>.

## **Vulnerability Management for a Variety of Industries**

Nearly every industry relies on applications and networks to conduct business, though some have more stringent security requirements than others. Organizations in the aviation, automotive, healthcare, and financial sectors have some of the strongest security regulations. Layers of security during software and application development as well as after product deployment are necessary to keep consumers safe and organizations compliant.

![airplane icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilitiesaviation.png)

### [Aviation](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/aviation-software-testing-guide)

Cybersecurity is crucial to the aviation industry. Travelers in the sky need to be protected from any attacks that can prevent airlines from operating normally. Those same customers need to have their payment and sensitive data protected when purchasing a ticket.

### [Automotive](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guide/how-fuzz-testing-helps-secure-automotive-industry)

Wireless connectivity is becoming commonplace inside of new vehicles. Automotive connectivity to WIFI and Bluetooth are making vehicles a bigger target for cybercriminals. One vulnerability can take down any vehicle with that technology. DAST, Black Box Fuzzing, and SAST during development are a solid foundation of security to prevent these attacks.

![](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-automative.png)

![heartbeat](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-healthcare.png)

### [Healthcare and Medical](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/resources/guides/security-testing-for-networked-medical-devices)

Wireless technology and application software are being used more in medical devices to automate and monitor individual healthcare needs. Device security is the utmost priority, preventing risks that can directly endanger lives. Application security is needed to prevent cyber attackers from tampering with devices and stealing private healthcare data. SAST and DAST during development can help find vulnerabilities that can compromise these devices.

### Critical Infrastructure and Industrial Facilities

Water, power, and gas are some prime targets for large scale attacks. The best way to keep cyberattackers from taking down an entire city’s water supply is to create a layered cybersecurity portfolio. From the start, vulnerabilities need to be identified, remediated, and constantly monitored to prevent a mass standstill of public utilities.

![lightning bolt icon](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-critical-industries.png)

![factory](https://www.beyondsecurity.com/app/uploads/2024/01/fta-beyond-security-vulnerabilities-manufactures.png)

### Discrete Manufacturers

Manufacturing industries keep building and assembling essential pieces for everyday life. Any attack on that automation would create a bottleneck in multiple industries that rely on these products. A disruption in manufacturing has been proven to drive up prices and create a negative workflow ripple worldwide. Using layered security solutions prior to deployment and scanning afterwards will help prevent any shutdown.

### Financial

Financial institutions are still top cyberattacker targets. Monetary apps for banks, credit unions, investment, and retirement firms need the highest cybersecurity measures. Security that prevents cyberattacks should be implemented during development and embedded directly into these applications. Compliance for this industry is only growing with each reported breach.
