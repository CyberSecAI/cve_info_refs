Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-8715:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in a third-party component used by Palo Alto Networks. Specifically, a specially crafted HTTP POST request with an invalid “If-modified” header field can trigger a NULL pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- NULL pointer dereference: The primary vulnerability is that a malformed HTTP request leads to a NULL pointer dereference in the PAN-OS Management Web Interface code.
- Improper Authentication: The vulnerability can be triggered without any login or authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service condition, causing the management service to crash. The web interface becomes unavailable for administration.
- Potential impact to confidentiality and integrity: Although the primary impact is on availability, the CVE description indicates potential impacts on confidentiality and integrity as well, albeit less direct.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a malicious HTTP request over the network.
- HTTP POST request: The specific attack vector involves sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request with an invalid "If-modified" header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No authentication required: An attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any privileged access to trigger the vulnerability.
- Network access: The attacker needs to have network connectivity to reach the PAN-OS Management Web Interface.
- Ability to craft HTTP requests: The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP POST requests with the specific malicious header.

**Additional details from provided content:**
- Affected PAN-OS versions: 6.1.20 and earlier, 7.1.16 and earlier, 8.0.9 and earlier, and 8.1.0.
-  Vulnerability discovery: The vulnerability was discovered externally.
-  Severity: Rated as HIGH with a CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.1.
-  Mitigation:  The provided documentation advises to follow best practices for securing the administrative access of the PAN-OS interface.
