# Exploit Title : Activity Log Wordpress Plugin Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
# Date: 25-02-2018
# Exploit Author : Stefan Broeder
# Vendor Homepage: https://pojo.me
# Software Link: https://wordpress.org/plugins/aryo-activity-log/
# Version: 2.4.0
# CVE : CVE-2018-8729
# Category : webapps

Description
===========
Activity Log is a WordPress plugin which tracks site activity. It has more than 70.000 active installations. Version 2.4.0 (and possibly the previous ones) are affected by several Stored XSS vulnerabilities.

Vulnerable part of code
=======================
Storing the payload:
File: aryo-activity-log/hooks/class-aal-hook-attachment.php:14. The log entry that is stored contains the result of get_the_title($post->ID), which can include HTML and is not sanitized by WordPress.
File: aryo-activity-log/hooks/class-aal-hook-comments.php:14. The log entry that is stored contains the result of get_the_title($comment->comment_post_ID), which can include HTML and is not sanitized by WordPress.
File: aryo-activity-log/hooks/class-aal-hook-posts.php:7. The log entry that is stored contains the result of $title = get_the_title($post), which can include HTML and is not sanitized by WordPress.

Displaying the payload:
File: aryo-activity-log/classes/class-aal-activity-log-list-table.php:209. $item->object_name is displayed without sanitization and can contain HTML tags.

Impact
======
Arbitrary JavaScript code can be run on browser side if a user is able to create a post or upload an attachment.

Exploitation
============
To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to perform any of the following:
- Create/edit/draft/publish/trash/untrash a post with JavaScript in the title
- Create/edit/trash/untrash/mark_as_spam/unmark_as_spam a comment on a post with JavaScript in the title
- Add/edit/delete an attachment with JavaScript in the attachment title

Regular website visitors will not have the capability to do any of these, however, possible threat actors might include:
- A user with the role of ‘editor’ within WordPress (non-admins which are able to create content)
- A rogue administrator among multiple administrators
- A compromised plugin

If the payload has been injected, then it will be executed once the Activity Log is viewed. This can possibly lead to stealing of CSRF nonces and creation of new (administrator) users on the WordPress instance.

Solution
========
Update to 2.4.1

```

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Description

**AN EASY TO USE & FULLY SUPPORTED WORDPRESS ACTIVITY LOG PLUGIN**

Want to monitor and track your WordPress website activity? Find out exactly who does what on your WordPress website with this plugin. Activity Log is like an airplane’s black box that logs every action in the WordPress admin, and lets you see exactly what users are doing on your WordPress website.

* If someone is trying to hack your site
* When a post was published, and who published it
* If a plugin/theme was activated/deactivated
* Suspicious admin activity

It’s so essential; you’ll wonder how you ever managed your website without it. The plugin is also lightning fast and works behind the scenes, so it doesn\’t affect site and admin performance. For optimal performance, we built the plugin so that it runs on a separate table in the database.

If you have more than a handful of users, keeping track of who did what is virtually impossible. This plugin solves that issue by tracking what actions were initiated by which users, and displaying it in an easy-to-use and easy-to-filter view on the dashboard of your WordPress site.

**New! Introducing Email Logging** – Capture all emails sent from your WordPress site for streamlined debugging and compliance. Gain better visibility into email communication, aiding both troubleshooting and record-keeping. This is particularly beneficial for WooCommerce stores, allowing you to easily track sent emails alongside other critical site events.

**Export to CSV** – Export your Activity Log data records to CSV. Developers can easily add support for custom data formats with our new dedicated Export API.

**Data Privacy and GDPR Compliance** – We provide the tools to help you adhere to GDPR compliance standards, including Export/Erasure of data via the WordPress Privacy Tools.

### With the Activity Log you can record:

* **WordPress** – Core updates
* **Posts** – Created, updated, deleted
* **Pages** – Created, updated, deleted
* **Custom Post Type** – Created, updated, deleted
* **Tags** – Created, updated, deleted
* **Categories** – Created, updated, deleted
* **Taxonomies** – Created, updated, deleted
* **Menus** – Created, updated, deleted
* **Media** – Created, updated, deleted
* **Comments** – Created, approved, unapproved, trashed, untrashed, spammed, unspammed, deleted
* **Users** – Login, logout, login failed, update profile, registered, deleted
* **Plugins** – Installed, updated, activated, deactivated, changed
* **Themes** – Installed, updated, deleted, activated, changed (Editor and Customizer)
* **Widgets** – Added to sidebar, deleted from sidebar, order widgets
* **Setting** – General, writing, reading, discussion, media, permalinks
* **Options** – Extended custom settings for 3rd party plugins
* **Export** – Exported activity log file
* **WooCommerce** – Track products, orders, customers, and more
* **bbPress** – Forums, topics, replies, taxonomies, and other actions
* **Emails sent from WordPress site** – Sending successful, sending failed
* There’s more, of course, but you get the point…

For each event recorded by the activity log, the following details are also logged:

* Date and time of occurrence
* User and user role responsible for the change
* Source IP address from which the change originated
* Affected object where the change occurred

Being able to see what preceded an error on a website is so immensely helpful that you cannot imagine it before you actually try it.
Especially when working with clients. So many times have we been able to identify the cause of an issue, as we could see that “Oh, this person edited that page last Monday” or “Aha, function x stopped working after updating plugin y”.
It’s also valuable to check if someone else is working on a website, before making major changes, not disturbing each of the others work.
Activity Log is installed on all my websites, and has been for years. It fills a gap that, weirdly enough, is present in a CMS that encourages multiple users and roles.
Highly recommended. Five stars easily ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Greate user logs to go back in time to see who have done something wrong. In my opinion, this is a must plugin

I have installed this plugin on all my clients websites which helps me keep track of who did what making troubleshooting any issues quick and simple when something goes wrong.
I could have created a similar plugin myself, but what’s the point when the authors of Activity Log have already done such a great job? So, instead, I coded a script to send the info from this plugin to a central database where I can keep an eye on all client sites in one place, which is definitely easier than checking each one individually.
The only thing that is kind of annoying about this plugin is the Elementor ad a the top of the admin back-end. I am a big fan of Elementor for certain types of sites and use it on many sites, but I don’t need or want my clients to see these ads because it looks very unprofessional.
I certainly don’t mind having ads there if they support the authors in keeping plugins updated, but it can be quite annoying when they are, as the phrase goes, “in your face”.

## Description

**AN EASY TO USE & FULLY SUPPORTED WORDPRESS ACTIVITY LOG PLUGIN**

Want to monitor and track your WordPress website activity? Find out exactly who does what on your WordPress website with this plugin. Activity Log is like an airplane’s black box that logs every action in the WordPress admin, and lets you see exactly what users are doing on your WordPress website.

* If someone is trying to hack your site
* When a post was published, and who published it
* If a plugin/theme was activated/deactivated
* Suspicious admin activity

It’s so essential; you’ll wonder how you ever managed your website without it. The plugin is also lightning fast and works behind the scenes, so it doesn\’t affect site and admin performance. For optimal performance, we built the plugin so that it runs on a separate table in the database.

If you have more than a handful of users, keeping track of who did what is virtually impossible. This plugin solves that issue by tracking what actions were initiated by which users, and displaying it in an easy-to-use and easy-to-filter view on the dashboard of your WordPress site.

**New! Introducing Email Logging** – Capture all emails sent from your WordPress site for streamlined debugging and compliance. Gain better visibility into email communication, aiding both troubleshooting and record-keeping. This is particularly beneficial for WooCommerce stores, allowing you to easily track sent emails alongside other critical site events.

**Export to CSV** – Export your Activity Log data records to CSV. Developers can easily add support for custom data formats with our new dedicated Export API.

**Data Privacy and GDPR Compliance** – We provide the tools to help you adhere to GDPR compliance standards, including Export/Erasure of data via the WordPress Privacy Tools.

### With the Activity Log you can record:

* **WordPress** – Core updates
* **Posts** – Created, updated, deleted
* **Pages** – Created, updated, deleted
* **Custom Post Type** – Created, updated, deleted
* **Tags** – Created, updated, deleted
* **Categories** – Created, updated, deleted
* **Taxonomies** – Created, updated, deleted
* **Menus** – Created, updated, deleted
* **Media** – Created, updated, deleted
* **Comments** – Created, approved, unapproved, trashed, untrashed, spammed, unspammed, deleted
* **Users** – Login, logout, login failed, update profile, registered, deleted
* **Plugins** – Installed, updated, activated, deactivated, changed
* **Themes** – Installed, updated, deleted, activated, changed (Editor and Customizer)
* **Widgets** – Added to sidebar, deleted from sidebar, order widgets
* **Setting** – General, writing, reading, discussion, media, permalinks
* **Options** – Extended custom settings for 3rd party plugins
* **Export** – Exported activity log file
* **WooCommerce** – Track products, orders, customers, and more
* **bbPress** – Forums, topics, replies, taxonomies, and other actions
* **Emails sent from WordPress site** – Sending successful, sending failed
* There’s more, of course, but you get the point…

For each event recorded by the activity log, the following details are also logged:

* Date and time of occurrence
* User and user role responsible for the change
* Source IP address from which the change originated
* Affected object where the change occurred

The plugin doesn\’t require any kind of setup; it works right out of the box (just another reason people love it)!

### Data Storage and Performance Optimization

In order to ensure optimal performance of your website, all events and logs data are stored in a dedicated custom table within your WordPress database. This approach significantly reduces the impact on your website’s performance, ensuring seamless operation even during peak traffic periods.

### Uninstall Clean-up

We understand the importance of maintaining a clean and efficient database environment. That’s why our plugin features an uninstall hook that seamlessly removes all traces of its presence from your website when uninstalling. This meticulous clean-up process ensures that your database remains lean and clutter-free even after our plugin has been removed.

**With our optimized data storage, thorough logging, and meticulous clean-up process, you can trust that our plugin will enhance the functionality and security of your WordPress site without compromising its performance.**

Being able to see what preceded an error on a website is so immensely helpful that you cannot imagine it before you actually try it.
Especially when working with clients. So many times have we been able to identify the cause of an issue, as we could see that “Oh, this person edited that page last Monday” or “Aha, function x stopped working after updating plugin y”.
It’s also valuable to check if someone else is working on a website, before making major changes, not disturbing each of the others work.
Activity Log is installed on all my websites, and has been for years. It fills a gap that, weirdly enough, is present in a CMS that encourages multiple users and roles.
Highly recommended. Five stars easily ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Greate user logs to go back in time to see who have done something wrong. In my opinion, this is a must plugin

I have installed this plugin on all my clients websites which helps me keep track of who did what making troubleshooting any issues quick and simple when something goes wrong.
I could have created a similar plugin myself, but what’s the point when the authors of Activity Log have already done such a great job? So, instead, I coded a script to send the info from this plugin to a central database where I can keep an eye on all client sites in one place, which is definitely easier than checking each one individually.
The only thing that is kind of annoying about this plugin is the Elementor ad a the top of the admin back-end. I am a big fan of Elementor for certain types of sites and use it on many sites, but I don’t need or want my clients to see these ads because it looks very unprofessional.
I certainly don’t mind having ads there if they support the authors in keeping plugins updated, but it can be quite annoying when they are, as the phrase goes, “in your face”.
