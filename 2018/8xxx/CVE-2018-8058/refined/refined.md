Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-8058:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `pagedata` parameter within the `admin/moduleinterface.php` file of CMS Made Simple (CMSMS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize the `pagedata` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code. This injected code is then stored within the system and executed when other users access the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers, which can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking/cookie stealing
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
    *   Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is executed by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `admin/moduleinterface.php`.
*   **`pagedata` Parameter:** The malicious payload is injected into the `pagedata` parameter of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be logged in to the CMSMS admin interface with the ability to modify pages to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Target Page Modification:** The attacker must have the privileges to edit pages and modify the `pagedata` field.

**Technical Details**

*   The provided content includes a Proof-of-Concept (POC) HTTP POST request. This request shows how the malicious javascript `<svg/onload=alert(1)>` is injected through the `pagedata` parameter.
*   The CMSMS version affected is 2.2.6.
*  The payload `<svg/onload=alert(1)>` is a basic example. More complex payloads can be used for greater impact.

In summary, the provided content describes a Stored XSS vulnerability in CMS Made Simple 2.2.6, specifically in the `admin/moduleinterface.php` file through the `pagedata` parameter which can lead to arbitrary code execution in the browsers of other users who access the page, after the malicious payload has been stored.
