Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2018-8920:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper neutralization of escape characters in Log Exporter functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The Log Exporter in Synology DSM does not properly handle escape characters when exporting logs in CSV format. This allows injection of arbitrary content into the exported file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote attackers with high privileges can inject arbitrary content by exporting a log archive in CSV format. While the specific impact is "unspecified," the injected content could potentially lead to various outcomes depending on how the exported CSV file is used, including arbitrary code execution in systems processing the CSV data if they do not handle it correctly or if the CSV injection is used to bypass restrictions on file format/content.
- The attacker-controlled content could possibly lead to unintended actions when imported into other tools that consume CSV files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attackers with high privileges can exploit this vulnerability.
- The attack involves exporting log data in CSV format with malicious content.
- Attack requires user interaction, as the attacker needs to make a user export the malicious log.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a remote user with high privileges (PR:H) on the Synology DSM system.
- The attacker needs to trick a user with high privileges to export a CSV log containing injected content.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) versions prior to 6.1.6-15266.
- The severity is rated as "Moderate."
- The CVSS3 score is 5.9.
- The CVSS3 vector is CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L
