{
  "cveId": "CVE-2018-8007",
  "information": {
    "rootCause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is a lack of input validation in the CouchDB REST API when adding configuration options through the Fauxton web UI. The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input allowing newline characters to bypass the blacklisting mechanism.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Security bypass of blacklisting mechanism",
     "Arbitrary configuration write"
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated attacker with admin privileges can achieve remote code execution in the context of the CouchDB process user by injecting a malicious os_daemon entry into the local.ini configuration file. The attacker can then execute arbitrary commands on the server.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Network attack over HTTP REST API"
     ],
     "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker requires an authenticated admin user session to exploit the vulnerability.",
     "additionalDetails": "This vulnerability is a bypass of the security fix implemented for CVE-2017-12636. MDSec discovered and reported this vulnerability."
