{
  "CVE-2018-8897": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The MOV SS and POP SS instructions inhibit debug exceptions until the instruction boundary following the next instruction has completed. If that subsequent instruction causes a transition to supervisor mode (e.g., a system call), the debug exception will be handled in the kernel context instead of the user context.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Improper handling of debug exceptions",
      "Use of POP SS or MOV SS instruction"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability by a local authenticated attacker could result in disclosure of sensitive information, escalation of privilege, or cause a denial of service (DoS).",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access",
       "Authenticated attacker"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A local authenticated attacker needs the ability to control hardware debugging facilities to exploit the vulnerability, but such permissions are typically available to unprivileged users. They need to be able to execute code on the target system."
