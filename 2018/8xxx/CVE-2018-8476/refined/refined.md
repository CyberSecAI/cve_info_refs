  "CVE-2018-8476": {
    "Description": "The Windows Deployment Services (WDS) component has a use-after-free vulnerability. A remote attacker can trigger this vulnerability by sending specially crafted TFTP requests, which causes a race condition where a freed memory block is accessed. The vulnerability is located in wdstftp.dll.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a use-after-free condition in the handling of TFTP requests within the Windows Deployment Services (WDS). The TFTP server manages a cache of read requests using a linked list of `CacheBlock` structures, which is limited to two nodes. When more than two read requests are active, the oldest cache block is freed before the read operation is completed, resulting in a use-after-free when the callback function attempts to access the freed memory.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Use-After-Free (UAF)"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit of this vulnerability can lead to remote code execution with high privileges on a Windows server. It can also potentially lead to information disclosure, although this was not consistently achieved by the researchers.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a network-based attack, where an attacker sends specially crafted TFTP requests to a vulnerable WDS server. The vulnerability is triggered by exploiting a race condition when the server handles concurrent read requests.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the WDS server. No authentication is required, meaning the attacker only needs network access to the WDS server."
