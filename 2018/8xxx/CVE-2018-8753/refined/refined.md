Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-8753:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a Bleichenbacher padding oracle vulnerability present in the IKEv1 implementations of multiple vendors. This vulnerability stems from the improper handling of PKCS#1 v1.5 padding during RSA decryption in the IKE protocol.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Bleichenbacher Oracle:** The implementations reveal whether a modified ciphertext is PKCS#1 v1.5 compliant or not, through different error responses or timing. This information can be used in a Bleichenbacher attack.
- **PKCS#1 v1.5 padding vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the use of PKCS#1 v1.5 padding in the public key encryption (PKE) based authentication mode of IKEv1
- **Key Reuse:** Some vendors reuse the same RSA key pair across different versions and modes of IKE, allowing cross-protocol attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Decryption of IPsec Tunnel Data:** Attackers can decrypt IPsec tunnel ciphertext data by exploiting the Bleichenbacher oracle. This compromises the confidentiality of the VPN.
- **Impersonation of IKE Devices:** Attackers can impersonate a victim host or network by completing a handshake with falsely authenticated symmetric keys.
- **Signature Forgery:**  A Bleichenbacher oracle can be used to forge signatures, potentially breaking signature based authentication in IKEv1 and IKEv2.
- **Cross Protocol attacks**: Exploiting the IKEv1 vulnerability allows attacks on IKEv2, given key reuse.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the target device to perform the attack.
- **Man-in-the-middle (MitM):**  Although not explicitly mentioned in all of the content, an active man-in-the-middle position is necessary to intercept and modify IKE packets for the attack. The attacker must be able to monitor the victim's communication and insert specially crafted packets.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to capture IKE handshake messages and modify ciphertexts.
- Ability to initiate IKE handshakes with the target device, sending modified ciphertexts and analyzing responses.
-  Network proximity to the target device.
- For cross-protocol attacks, the attacker also needs access to devices using different IKE versions.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Attack Complexity:** The attack complexity is increased by the time-sensitive nature of IKE handshakes. The attacker must complete the Bleichenbacher attack within the lifetime of the IKEv1 Phase 1 session, usually within a time limit.
*   **Practicality:** The researchers performed the attack on real devices, successfully demonstrating the feasibility of the exploit.
*   **Mitigation:** The identified vendors have released patches to address this vulnerability. The patches range from disabling the vulnerable authentication method to removing the Bleichenbacher oracle.

**Vendors Affected:**
- Cisco
- Huawei
- Clavister
- ZyXEL
