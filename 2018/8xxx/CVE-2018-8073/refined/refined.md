Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-8073:

**Verification:**
The provided content includes a specific mention of CVE-2018-8073, linking it to a remote code execution vulnerability in the `yii\redis\ActiveRecord::findOne()` and `yii\redis\ActiveRecord::findAll()` methods within the `yiisoft/yii2-redis` package. This confirms that the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the way user input is handled in the `findOne()` and `findAll()` methods of the `yii\redis\ActiveRecord` class within the Yii framework's Redis extension. When these methods receive unfiltered user input, they can be manipulated to execute arbitrary code within the Redis server's Lua script environment.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to achieve remote code execution on the Redis server due to the lack of proper input sanitization or validation within the `findOne()` and `findAll()` methods.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The vulnerability is caused by the failure of the `findOne()` and `findAll()` methods to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input when constructing Redis queries, which allows the injection of malicious Lua code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary Lua scripts on the Redis server. This could allow them to manipulate data stored within the Redis server.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate the data on the redis server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send specially crafted requests containing malicious input to an application that uses vulnerable versions of the `yiisoft/yii2-redis` package. The `findOne()` and `findAll()` methods of  `yii\redis\ActiveRecord` are then used in the vulnerable application to query redis, processing the malicious input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send requests to an application that is connected to a vulnerable Redis server.
- **Understanding of the Vulnerable API:** The attacker needs to know how to manipulate the vulnerable `findOne()` and `findAll()` methods with malicious input.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability specifically affects the `yiisoft/yii2-redis` extension.
- The fix is available in version 2.0.8 of the `yiisoft/yii2-redis` extension.
- The issue stems from the fact that these methods accept an arbitrary condition which can be controlled by a malicious user.
- The vulnerability is a result of an improper treatment of user-provided input, which allows the injection of arbitrary code into the redis server.

**Summary:**
CVE-2018-8073 is a remote code execution vulnerability in the Yii framework's Redis extension. It is caused by the insecure handling of user input in `findOne()` and `findAll()` methods, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary Lua code on the Redis server and potentially manipulate data. To mitigate, users should update the `yiisoft/yii2-redis` extension to version 2.0.8 or higher, and carefully review their application code for any direct usage of user inputs as the condition argument of those methods.
