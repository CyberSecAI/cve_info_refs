Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-8013:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing check in Apache Batik when deserializing a subclass of `AbstractDocument`. Specifically, the code doesn't validate the class type before calling `newInstance`, allowing an attacker to control the instantiation of arbitrary classes during deserialization of XML data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The core issue is that Batik deserializes XML input without properly validating the types of objects being created. This makes it possible to instantiate arbitrary classes.
- **Lack of input validation:** There is a lack of validation of the class type before the `newInstance` call.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to achieve:
- **Information Disclosure:** By crafting a malicious XML, the attacker can force the instantiation of objects and subsequently expose sensitive data.
- **Denial of Service:** The vulnerable component could also be made to crash or become unresponsive.
- **Cross-site scripting:** As described in Debian Security Advisory DSA-4215-1, it can potentially be used for cross-site scripting.
- **Access restricted files on the server:** As described in Debian Security Advisory DSA-4215-1, it can be used to access restricted files.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious XML:** The attacker must be able to supply a specially crafted XML file to the vulnerable Batik component.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious XML file that will be processed by a vulnerable version of Apache Batik.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same machine (remote).

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in Batik version 1.10.
- Patches were created to fix the vulnerability by adding the class type validation.
- The vulnerability is present in older versions of Batik, specifically version 1.9.1 and earlier.
- This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2018-8013.
- Multiple Linux distributions including Ubuntu and Debian have issued security advisories to address this issue.
- The fix was applied by introducing validation of the class type before using `newInstance`, as shown in `debian/patches/CVE-2018-8013.patch`.
