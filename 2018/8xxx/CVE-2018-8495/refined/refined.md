Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, which aligns with CVE-2018-8495:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the insecure handling of custom URI schemes in Microsoft Edge, specifically the `wshfile:` URI scheme. This scheme directly passes user-supplied arguments to `WScript.exe` (Windows Script Host) without proper sanitization. By combining this with a path traversal vulnerability, an attacker can specify the path to an arbitrary script to execute.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Insecure URI Scheme Handling:** The `wshfile:` URI scheme allows execution of scripts via `WScript.exe` without proper validation of the provided path and arguments.
2.  **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability allows the attacker to traverse directories when specifying the path to a file, thus bypassing intended path restrictions.
3.  **WSH Injection:** The attacker can leverage a VBScript file (`SyncAppvPublishingServer.vbs`) that takes arguments and uses them in a PowerShell command without sanitization, thus allowing execution of arbitrary commands via powershell.
4. **Lack of input sanitization:** Edge does not sanitize quotation marks allowing injection of additional parameters into WScript.exe

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the privileges of the user running the browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Custom URI Scheme:** The attack is triggered when the user clicks on a specially crafted URL (e.g., `wshfile:test/../../WinSxS/AMD921~1.48_/SyncAppvPublishingServer.vbs" test test;calc;").`
*   **Path Traversal:** Allows specifying an arbitrary path to the VBScript file located outside the intended directory.
*   **WSH Injection:** The attacker injects malicious commands into the VBScript parameters which will be executed via powershell.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to deliver a link to the victim:** The attacker needs to lure the victim into clicking a malicious link. This can be achieved through various means, such as a malicious website, phishing email or a crafted document.
*   **Basic Knowledge of Windows File System:** The attacker needs knowledge of Windows file system to locate a suitable script for WSH injection (e.g. SyncAppvPublishingServer.vbs in this case).
*   **Knowledge of Windows Scripting:** The attacker has to be familiar with VBScript and Powershell to craft the malicious code to be injected.

**Additional details:**
*   The attack leverages a prompt that appears when launching a custom URI scheme. Since the "OK" button has the default focus, a user can be tricked into accepting the prompt by simply holding down the enter key.
