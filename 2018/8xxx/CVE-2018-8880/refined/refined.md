{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application exposes a /deviceIP endpoint that returns sensitive device information in a structured HTML format.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information disclosure due to lack of access control on the /deviceIP endpoint.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can obtain sensitive device information such as MAC address, product details, serial number, GUID, code version, internal IP, subnet mask, gateway, and port numbers for Telnet, FTP, and remote access. This information can be used for further attacks.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET request to the /deviceIP endpoint of the Lutron Quantum device.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Lutron Quantum device. No authentication is required to access the /deviceIP endpoint."
