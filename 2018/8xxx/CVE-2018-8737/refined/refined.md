Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-8737:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The Bookme Control Panel 2.0 application fails to sanitize user-supplied input within the "Name" and "Note" fields (parameters `custName` and `custNote`) of the "Customers" section. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code is injected and persistently stored in the application's database. This code is then executed when other users view the affected data.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code that can lead to:
    *   Hijacking user sessions.
    *   Malicious redirects to attacker-controlled sites.
    *   Defacement of web sites.
    *   Insertion of hostile content.
    *   Redirection of users.
    *   Hijacking the userâ€™s browser using malware.
    *   Information disclosure via cookie access

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is remote, where an attacker injects malicious script via the "Name" and "Note" input fields on the "Customers" section of the application. The injected script is executed when other users access the vulnerable page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to have an account and be authenticated to the Bookme Control Panel 2.0 to access the "Book Me - Customers" section.
*   The attacker must be able to submit data to the `custName` and `custNote` fields, which are not properly sanitized.

**Proof of Concept**

1. Log in to the site
2. Navigate to "Book Me - Customers" section.
3. Insert `<script>alert("document.cookie")</script>` into the "Name" or "Note" field, and save.
4. Access `https://<url>/products/bookme-wp-booking-plugin/wp-admin/admin.php?page=bookme-customers`.
5. A popup displaying the document cookies will appear.
