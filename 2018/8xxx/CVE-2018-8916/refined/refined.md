- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unverified password change in the "Change Password" feature of Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of password change verification.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote authenticated users can reset the password of other users without any verification process. This could lead to unauthorized access and control over affected accounts.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a remote authenticated user with a valid account on the affected DSM system.
