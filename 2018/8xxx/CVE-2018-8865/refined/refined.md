- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Lantech IDS 2102 Ethernet device server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the device and has to craft malicious input to trigger the buffer overflow. The attack can be achieved with low skill level.
