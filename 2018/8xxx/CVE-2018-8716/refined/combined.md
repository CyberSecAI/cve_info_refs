=======================================================================
              title: Multiple Stored XSS Vulnerabilities
            product: WSO2 Carbon, WSO2 Dashboard Server
 vulnerable version: WSO2 Identity Server 5.3.0
      fixed version: WSO2 Identity Server 5.5.0
         CVE number: CVE-2018-8716
             impact: high

Vendor description:
-------------------
"WSO2 Carbon redefines middleware by providing an integrated and componentized
middleware platform that adapts to the specific needs of any enterprise
IT project - on premise or in the cloud.
100% open source and standards-based, WSO2 Carbon enables developers to rapidly
orchestrate business processes, compose applications and develop services using
WSO2 Developer Studio and a broad range of business and technical services that
integrate with legacy, packaged and SaaS applications.
The lean, complete, OSGi-based platform includes more than 175 components – OSGi
bundles or Carbon features. The WSO2 Carbon core framework functions as
“Eclipse for servers” and includes common capabilities shared by all WSO2
products, such as built-in registry, user management, transports, security,
logging, clustering, caching and throttling services, co-ordination, and a
GUI framework."

Source: <https://wso2.com/products/carbon/>

"The WSO2 Dashboard Server (formerly WSO2 User Engagement Server) helps to
rapidly create visually appealing and engaging web components such as
dashboards, and gadgets, and unlocking data for business intelligence and
monitoring. With the host of capabilities that Dashboard Server provides
out-of-the-box, going from data to screen has never been easier."

Source: <https://wso2.com/products/dashboard-server/>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends to perform a thorough security review conducted by
security professionals to identify and resolve all security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Stored Cross-Site Scripting in WSO2 Dashboard (CVE-2018-8716)
The dashboard is used by the end-users to manage their accounts, change passwords,
alter their profiles, or change certain settings. An attacker is able to inject
arbitrary JavaScript payloads into various textboxes (username, home address,
lastname, firstname, etc).

The payloads are permanently stored in the dashboard and triggered every time the
dashboard is visited. The payload is also potentially triggered in the carbon
part of WSO2, which means that an attacker would be able to inject payloads
from the front-end application into a middleware application, which is not
accessible from the internet and attack administrators.

2) Stored Cross-Site Scripting in WSO2 Carbon
The carbon UI offers a feature to add multiple BPS-Worker Hosts. In the worker
host URL an arbitrary JavaScript payload can be injected and permanently stored
in the web application.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Stored Cross-Site Scripting in WS02 Dashboard
The following input fields are vulnerable and JavaScript payloads can be directly
injected:
- Firstname
- Lastname
- Username
- Address

It is suspected, that all user inputs are returned unfiltered in all server responses.

2) Stored Cross-Site Scripting in WSO2 Carbon
To demonstrate the vulnerability, it is sufficient to add a new BPS worker and set
the URL to the following payload: "><img src=x onerror=aler(document.cookie)>

Everytime the carbon middleware application is accessed, the payload is triggered.

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following version has been tested which was the most recent version
at the time of discovery:

* WSO2IS 5.3.0

Vendor contact timeline:
------------------------
2018-01-25: Contacting vendor through security () wso2 com
2018-02-08: Asking for status update. Vendor responds, that they are
            still investigating the issue.
2018-02-21: Vendor responds with release date and further details
            concerning the nature of the vulnerabilities. The XSS in the
            Carbon component was a duplicate and should be already fixed.
            Concerning the XSS in the dashboard a fix is implemented
            and will be rolled out with the release of WSO2 Identity
            Server 5.5.0.
2018-03-14: Requesting CVE from Mitre for the stored XSS in the Dashboard.
2018-03-15: Mitre assigned CVE-2018-8716.
2018-03-26: Vendor informed us, that the final release of the updated
            software will be on 5th of April.
2018-04-23: Public Release

Solution:
---------
Update WSO2 Identity Server to 5.5.0

Workaround:
-----------
No workaround available

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
