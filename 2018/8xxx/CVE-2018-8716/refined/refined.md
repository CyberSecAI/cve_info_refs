Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-8716

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the WSO2 Carbon and Dashboard Server. User-supplied data entered into various text fields is not being filtered or escaped, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are present in two components:
    1.  **WSO2 Dashboard:** Multiple input fields (e.g., firstname, lastname, username, address) allow for injection of arbitrary JavaScript.
    2. **WSO2 Carbon:** The worker host URL field, when adding BPS-Worker Hosts, allows for injection of arbitrary JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and permanently store malicious JavaScript payloads.
-  These payloads are executed whenever the vulnerable pages are accessed, potentially affecting all users of the application.
-   Specifically, the XSS in the dashboard can potentially allow an attacker to inject payloads into the middleware application (WSO2 Carbon), which might not be directly accessible from the internet, and then target administrators. This highlights an escalation of privilege from front-end to back-end environments.
-  The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser session, leading to actions like:
    - Stealing session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Data exfiltration
    - Defacing the web application

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through injecting malicious JavaScript into user-input fields.
- Specifically, the vulnerable fields include:
    - Firstname, Lastname, Username, and Address in the WSO2 Dashboard.
    - The BPS worker host URL in WSO2 Carbon.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the user input fields in the WSO2 Dashboard or the WSO2 Carbon management interface. This means an attacker needs to have a valid account on WSO2 application, which may require some level of access.
- No specific privileges are mentioned beyond the ability to modify user profiles/settings or add BPS worker hosts.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered on 2017-12-13.
- The issue was reported to WSO2 on 2018-01-25.
- The fix was released in WSO2 Identity Server 5.5.0
- The advisory mentions that the XSS in the carbon component was a duplicate and should be already fixed.
