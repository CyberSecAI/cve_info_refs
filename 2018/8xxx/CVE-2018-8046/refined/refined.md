Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-8046:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `getTip()` method of Action Columns within the Sencha Ext JS framework. This method takes HTML-escaped data and then un-escapes it. This process can introduce a vulnerability if the tooltip's content is user-controlled, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of built-in XSS protection:** The framework itself does not provide built-in mechanisms to prevent XSS, placing the onus on developers to sanitize output.
- **Un-escaping of HTML-escaped data:** The `getTip()` methodâ€™s behavior of un-escaping data that has already been HTML-escaped introduces a security hole. This allows malicious code to be introduced via the tooltip.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would result in an XSS attack. This would allow an attacker to:
- Execute malicious JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser.
- Steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
- Redirect the user to a malicious website.
- Modify the content of the web page.
- Perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript code into user-controlled data that is then used to generate a tooltip.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject code into user-controlled data that will eventually be displayed in the tooltip via the `getTip()` method. This could occur from:
  -  Modifying data within the application via forms or APIs.
  -  Compromising external data sources used by the application

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Sencha Ext JS versions 4 through 6.
- The issue is tracked internally by the vendor as EXTJS-26864.
- A fix is available in version 6.6.0.
- A fiddle demonstrating the issue is available at: <https://fiddle.sencha.com/#fiddle/2e3k&view/editor>.
