Whether you're gaming online in a heated competition or streaming a live event in 4K UHD, lag and buffering are simply not an option. NitroQAMâ¢ (1024-QAM) technology delivers the ultimate 5GHz quad-stream (4x4) speeds of up to 2167Mbps, giving RT-AC86U combined total speed of 2917Mbps. So everyone on your network can enjoy smooth streaming and low-latency online gaming!

![ASUS RT-AC86U delivers up to 2167Mbps at 5GHz band](https://dlcdnimgs.asus.com/websites/global/products/FuSr2UwZNsqc7PRa/img/Fast-80211ac-Wi-Fi-speed-comparison.png)

## Powerful Hardware, Ultimate Performance

With the increasing popularity of 5GHz Wi-Fi devices, a router needs to deliver the maximum 5GHz bandwidth possible, with reliable long-range performance. RT-AC86U has an extra internal 5GHz antenna to provide the ultimate 5GHz quad-stream performance, while RangeBoost significantly improves mid- to long-distance Wi-Fi coverage. Additionally, RT-AC86U's top-of-the-line 1.8GHz 64bit dual-core processor brings its computational capability to the next level, enabling USB data transfers of up to 110MB/s and router download/upload speeds (WAN-LAN throughput) of up to 1600Mbps2.

![ASUS RT-AC86U router provides double gaming boots](https://dlcdnimgs.asus.com/websites/global/products/FuSr2UwZNsqc7PRa/img/Double-gaming-boost.png)

## Free Game Accelerator Inside

Ping time and variance are critical technical parameters that affect responsiveness in online gaming, and their values depend heavily on the route game packets take to and from their destination. The Gamers Private NetworkÂ® (GPNÂ®) from WTFastÂ® automatically performs route optimization, choosing the most efficient route for game packets, resulting in consistently-lower ping time and minimal packet loss. With RT-AC86U this optimization is free for accelerating one selectable device at a time, so you can enjoy the results on supported competitive multi-player online games1. Check out supported games list and more information about WTFast router edition [here.](https://www.wtfast.com/pages/asus_router/)

![ASUS RT-AC86U router's built in game acceleration â Gamer's private network helps to lower 30% to 60% of the average ping time, 70% to 90% of average ping variation and 70% to 90% packet loss also.](https://dlcdnimgs.asus.com/websites/global/products/FuSr2UwZNsqc7PRa/img/GPN-Lower-Ping-Time-Ping-Variation-and-packet-loss.png)

## Adaptive QoS â Prioritize Your Game

Boost your gaming bandwidth with Adaptive QoS (Quality of Service), which allows you to easily prioritize gaming packets and activities. You can even assign full dedicated bandwidth while gaming under gamer solo mode, making RT-AC86U the perfect ally for low latency gaming anywhere in your home. It supports major consoles including PlayStationÂ®3, PlayStationÂ®4, PS4â¢ Pro, PlayStationÂ®Vita, Wii U, 3DS and Xbox One.

![ASUS RT-AC86U can prioritize your game](https://dlcdnimgs.asus.com/websites/global/products/FuSr2UwZNsqc7PRa/img/Adaptive-QoS.png)

## Multiple Capacity Wi-Fi with Revolutionary MU-MIMO Technology

MU-MIMO gives every compatible device3 its own dedicated full-speed Wi-Fi connection, so that multiple devices can connect at the same time without slowing down the network.
In fact, RT-AC86U is able to connect to multiple MU-MIMO-compatible clients at each device's maximum speed simultaneously, unlike standard single-user MIMO where individual devices have to wait for sequential transmissions.

![ASUS RT-AC86U router features MU-MIMO technology](https://dlcdnimgs.asus.com/websites/global/products/FuSr2UwZNsqc7PRa/img/MU-MIMO-Technology.png)

## Unbeatable Coverage

With ASUS innovative antenna design and the new Range Boost technology, both Wi-Fi range and signal stability improve dramatically. AiRadar further focuses Wi-Fi signal on your devices, making your Wi-Fi faster, clearer and stronger.

![ASUS RT-AC86U router features RangeBoost increasing up to 120% Wi-Fi signal coverage.](https://dlcdnimgs.asus.com/websites/global/products/FuSr2UwZNsqc7PRa/img/RangeBoost.png)

## AiProtection ProCommercial-Grade Security for Family

## Fortified Frontline Network Security

Networking is only half the equation when it comes to game performance. As AiProtection is integrated in RT-AC86U and powered by the router, even if a device's security software isn't turned on â to get around blocked games, for example â AiProtection still protects the network from attacks and intrusions, for added peace of mind.

![ASUS RT-AC86U provides fortified frontline network security](https://dlcdnimgs.asus.com/websites/global/products/FuSr2UwZNsqc7PRa/img/sec6-img.png)
