{
  "CVE-2018-8288": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises because the Chakra JavaScript engine in Microsoft Edge does not properly handle the ImplicitCallFlags flag during the initialization of the Intl object. Specifically, when the Intl object hasn't been initialized, accessing any of its properties triggers the initialization process, which runs `Intl.js` without checking the `ImplicitCallFlags` flag.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of the `ImplicitCallFlags` flag",
      "Uncontrolled initialization process of the Intl object"
    ],
    "impact": "A specially crafted web page can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition when loaded in Microsoft Edge. The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates this by redefining `Map.prototype.get` to intercept the execution of `Intl.js` during the Intl object initialization, leading to a crash when an unexpected object is assigned to `arr[0]`.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "A specially crafted web page loaded in Microsoft Edge"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to get a user to load the malicious web page in Microsoft Edge to trigger the vulnerability"
  }
