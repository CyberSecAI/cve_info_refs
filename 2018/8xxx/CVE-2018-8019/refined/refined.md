{
  "Root cause": "Tomcat Native did not correctly handle invalid OCSP responses.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Mishandled OCSP invalid responses"
  ],
  "Impact": "Revoked client certificates could be incorrectly identified, allowing users to authenticate with revoked certificates when using mutual TLS.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "OCSP responder"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to present a revoked certificate and have the server perform an OCSP check. The attacker needs to have a revoked certificate which is still considered valid due to the vulnerability."
