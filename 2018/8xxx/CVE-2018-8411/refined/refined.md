{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `FSCTL_FIND_FILES_BY_SID` control code does not check for directory listing permissions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information Disclosure vulnerability. The control code is specified for `FILE_ANY_ACCESS`, allowing it to be issued for any handle on a directory, even with only `SYNCHRONIZE` access, bypassing `FILE_LIST_DIRECTORY` permission checks.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A less privileged attacker can list file names in a directory they have some access to, even without `FILE_LIST_DIRECTORY` permission. This allows bypassing security measures intended to prevent users from listing files in specific directories, such as the `Windows\\Temp` directory.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker with some form of access to a directory can use the `FSCTL_FIND_FILES_BY_SID` control code through an arbitrary handle, even with only `SYNCHRONIZE` access, to list files within that directory.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to open a directory for at least `SYNCHRONIZE` access. This means they need some level of access to the target directory but not necessarily `FILE_LIST_DIRECTORY` permissions. The vulnerability is triggered on volumes that have quota tracking enabled."
