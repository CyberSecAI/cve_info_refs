Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-8718:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Missing permission check in the Mailer Plugin

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing Permission Check:** The Mailer plugin lacked proper permission checks when handling test email functionality. This allowed users with `Overall/Read` access to Jenkins to trigger sending test emails.
*  **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The test email functionality did not require a POST request, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could potentially cause a DoS by providing a valid mail server but using invalid credentials, or by sending a large number of emails.
*  **Unauthorized Test Email Sending**: Users with `Overall/Read` access could send test emails to arbitrary recipients, using attacker specified mail server and credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network, as it involves sending requests to the Jenkins server.
*   **CSRF:** Attackers can leverage CSRF to trigger the test email functionality if a victim visits a malicious website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker requires at least `Overall/Read` access to Jenkins.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Jenkins server to exploit the missing permission check or set up a CSRF attack.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed by adding a POST request requirement to the test email URL and by implementing an `Overall/Administer` permission check.
*   The mail subject and body could not be changed, limiting the impact of the email sending, but not preventing the DoS.
*  The exploit-db content provides a script for exploiting this vulnerability using CSRF, and allows an attacker to send arbitrary test emails using their own mail server settings.
