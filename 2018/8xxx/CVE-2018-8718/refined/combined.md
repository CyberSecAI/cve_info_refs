## Descriptions

### GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin stores GitHub access tokens in build.xml

**SECURITY-261
/
CVE-2018-1000142**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ghprb`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ghprb)**

**Description:**

GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin stored serialized objects in `build.xml` files that contained the credential used to poll Jenkins.
This can be used by users with Jenkins controller file system access to obtain GitHub credentials.

Since 1.40.0, the plugin no longer stores serialized objects containing the credential on disk.

Builds started before the plugin was updated to 1.40.0 will retain the encoded credentials on disk.
We strongly recommend revoking old GitHub credentials used in Jenkins.
We’re providing [a script for use in the Script Console that will attempt to remove old stored credentials from build.xml files](https://github.com/jenkinsci-cert/SECURITY-261).

### GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin stores webhook secret in plain text

**SECURITY-262
/
CVE-2018-1000143**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:**

**Description:**

GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin stored the webhook secret shared between Jenkins and GitHub in plain text.

This allowed users with Jenkins controller local file system access and Jenkins administrators to retrieve the stored password.
The latter could result in exposure of the passwords through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin 1.32.1 and newer stores the webhook secret encrypted on disk.

### Cucumber Living Documentation Plugin disabled Content-Security-Policy for archived and workspace files

**SECURITY-308
/
CVE-2018-1000144**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`cucumber-living-documentation`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/cucumber-living-documentation)**

**Description:**

Jenkins 1.641 and 1.625.3 introduced `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP headers as protection against Cross-Site Scripting attacks using workspace files and archived artifacts served using `DirectoryBrowserSupport` ([SECURITY-95](/security/advisory/2015-12-09/)).

Cucumber Living Documentation Plugin disabled this XSS protection until Jenkins was restarted whenever a Cucumber Report was viewed by any user to work around the `Content-Security-Policy` limitations.

While disabling this protection mechanism temporarily may be necessary to make plugins work that haven’t been adapted to work with the Content-Security-Policy restriction, this should only be done by administrators, as doing so may result in a security issue (see [Configuring Content Security Policy](/doc/book/security/configuring-content-security-policy)).

This has been addressed in version 1.1.0 of the plugin, and it will now request that users change the Content-Security-Policy option in Jenkins.

### Perforce Plugin uses ineffective credentials encryption

**SECURITY-373
/
CVE-2018-1000145**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`perforce`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/perforce)**

**Description:**

Perforce Plugin encrypts its credentials using DES and an encryption key stored in its public source code, so it only serves as basic obfuscation.
This allowed users with Jenkins controller local file system access and Jenkins administrators to retrieve the stored password.
The latter could result in exposure of the passwords through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
The plugin has been removed from publication at the request of its former maintainers.
We recommend that users of Perforce Plugin use the [P4 Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/p4) instead.

### vSphere Plugin does not validate SSL/TLS certificates

**SECURITY-504
/
CVE-2018-1000151**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`vsphere-cloud`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/vsphere-cloud)**

**Description:**

vSphere Plugin disabled SSL/TLS certificate validation unconditionally, allowing potential man-in-the-middle attacks.

vSphere Plugin 2.17 now has SSL/TLS certificate validation enabled by default.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in vSphere Plugin form validation allowed enumerating credentials IDs, capturing credentials, and denial of service

**SECURITY-745
/
CVE-2018-1000152 and CVE-2018-1000153**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`vsphere-cloud`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/vsphere-cloud)**

**Description:**

vSphere Plugin did not perform permission checks on methods implementing form validation.
This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to perform various actions such as:

* Connect to an attacker-specified vSphere server using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins
* Connect to configured vSphere servers and looking up information, potentially resulting in denial of service

Additionally, these form validation methods did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

These form validation methods now require POST requests and appropriate user permissions.

### Liquibase Runner Plugin allows users to load arbitrary Java code into controller JVM

**SECURITY-519
/
CVE-2018-1000146**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[high](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`liquibase-runner`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/liquibase-runner)**

**Description:**

Liquibase Runner Plugin allows users with Job/Configure permission to configure its build step in a way that loads arbitrary class files into the Jenkins controller JVM, resulting in arbitrary code execution.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Perforce Plugin credentials can be obtained by users with Job/Extended Read permission

**SECURITY-536
/
CVE-2018-1000147**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`perforce`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/perforce)**

**Description:**

Jenkins prevents users with Extended Read permission from obtaining secrets such as credentials stored in job configurations.

Perforce Plugin implements its own credential encryption using DES and an encryption key stored in its public source code.
This is not considered a secret by Jenkins, resulting in potential exposure of Perforce credentials stored in job configurations to users with Extended Read permission.
While these are encrypted, this can only be considered basic obfuscation due to the hard-coded public encryption key used.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
The plugin has been removed from publication at the request of its maintainers.
We recommend that users of Perforce Plugin use the [P4 Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/p4) instead.

### Copy To Slave Plugin allows access to arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system

**SECURITY-545
/
CVE-2018-1000148**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`copy-to-slave`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/copy-to-slave)**

**Description:**

Copy To Slave Plugin allows users with Job/Configure permissions to configure it in such a way that it allows obtaining arbitrary files accessible to the Jenkins controller process from the Jenkins controller file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Ansible Plugin disabled host key verification by default

**SECURITY-630
/
CVE-2018-1000149**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`ansible`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ansible)**

**Description:**

Ansible Plugin disabled host key verification by default, having it only as an opt-in option.

Ansible Plugin 1.0 now enables host key verification by default, adding options allowing users to opt out.

Existing configurations that previously did not opt into host key verification will have host key verification enabled after update, possibly resulting in failures.

### Reverse Proxy Auth persisted authorities cache on disk

**SECURITY-736
/
CVE-2018-1000150**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`reverse-proxy-auth-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/reverse-proxy-auth-plugin)**

**Description:**

Reverse Proxy Auth Plugin persisted a cache of granted authorities (group memberships) on disk.

This could allow users with local Jenkins controller file system access to obtain group membership information of Jenkins users.

Reverse Proxy Auth Plugin 1.6.0 and newer no longer store the cache of granted authorities on disk.

### Mailer Plugin allowed unauthorized users to send test emails

**SECURITY-774
/
CVE-2018-8718**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`mailer`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/mailer)**

**Description:**

A missing permission check in Mailer Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to have it connect to a user-specified mail server with user-specified credentials to send a test email to a user-specified email address.
The email subject and body could not be changed.
This could result in DoS if, for example, specifying a valid mail server but invalid credentials.

As the same URL did not require POST to be used, it also was vulnerable to cross-site request forgery.

The URL handling test emails now requires POST to protect from CSRF, and performs an Overall/Administer permission check.

This plugin allows you to configure email notifications for build results. This is a break-out of the original core based email component.

## Configuration

In order to be able to send E-Mail notifications mail server configuration must be introduced in the *Manage Jenkins* page, *Configure System > E-mail Notification* section. Available options are:

* **SMTP server**: Name of the mail server. If empty the system will try to use the default server (which is normally the one running on `localhost`). Jenkins uses [JavaMail](https://javaee.github.io/javamail/) for sending out e-mails, and JavaMail allows additional settings to be given as system properties to the container. See [this document](http://jenkins-ci.org/javamail-properties) for possible values and effects.
* **Default user e-mail suffix**: If your users' e-mail addresses can be computed automatically by simply adding a suffix, then specify that suffix if this field. Otherwise leave it empty. Note that users can always override the e-mail address selectively. For example, if this field is set to `@acme.org`, then user foo will by default get the e-mail address [foo@acme.org](https://github.com/jenkinsci/mailer-plugin/blob/master/mailto%3Afoo%40acme.org).

There are some advanced options as well:

* **Use SMTP Authentication**: check this option to use SMTP authentication when sending out e-mails. If your environment requires the use of SMTP authentication, specify the user name and the password in the fields shown when this option is checked.
* **Use SSL**: Whether or not to use SSL for connecting to the SMTP server. Defaults to port `465`. Other advanced configurations can be done by setting system properties. See this document for possible values and effects.
* **Use TLS**: Whether or not to use TLS for connecting to the SMTP server. Defaults to port `587`. Other advanced configurations can be done by setting system properties. See this document for possible values and effects.
* **SMTP Port**: Port number for the mail server. Leave it empty to use the default port for the protocol (`587` if using TLS, `465` if using SSL, `25` if not using encryption).
* **Reply-To Address**: Address to include in the `Reply-To` header. Up to version `1.16`, only one address is allowed, starting in version `1.17` more than one can be used.
* **Charset**: character set to use to construct the message.

In order to test the configuration, you can check the *Test configuration by sending test e-mail* checkbox, provide a destination address at the *Test e-mail recipient* field and clicking the *Test configuration* button.

## Usage

E-Mail notifications are configured in jobs by adding an *E-mail notification* Post-build Action. If configured, Jenkins will send out an e-mail to the specified recipients when a certain important event occurs:

* Every failed build triggers a new e-mail.
* A successful build after a failed (or unstable) build triggers a new e-mail, indicating that a crisis is over.
* An unstable build after a successful build triggers a new e-mail, indicating that there’s a regression.
* Unless configured, every unstable build triggers a new e-mail, indicating that regression is still there.

The Recipients field must contain a whitespace or comma-separated list of recipient addresses. May reference build parameters like `$PARAM`.

Additional options include:

* **Send e-mail for every unstable build**: if checked, notifications will be sent for every unstable build and not only the first build after a successful one.
* **Send separate e-mails to individuals who broke the build**: if checked, the notification e-mail will be sent to individuals who have committed changes for the broken build (by assuming that those changes broke the build). If e-mail addresses are also specified in the recipient list, then both the individuals as well as the specified addresses get the notification e-mail. If the recipient list is empty, then only the individuals will receive e-mails.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Descriptions

### GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin stores GitHub access tokens in build.xml

**SECURITY-261
/
CVE-2018-1000142**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ghprb`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ghprb)**

**Description:**

GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin stored serialized objects in `build.xml` files that contained the credential used to poll Jenkins.
This can be used by users with Jenkins controller file system access to obtain GitHub credentials.

Since 1.40.0, the plugin no longer stores serialized objects containing the credential on disk.

Builds started before the plugin was updated to 1.40.0 will retain the encoded credentials on disk.
We strongly recommend revoking old GitHub credentials used in Jenkins.
We’re providing [a script for use in the Script Console that will attempt to remove old stored credentials from build.xml files](https://github.com/jenkinsci-cert/SECURITY-261).

### GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin stores webhook secret in plain text

**SECURITY-262
/
CVE-2018-1000143**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:**

**Description:**

GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin stored the webhook secret shared between Jenkins and GitHub in plain text.

This allowed users with Jenkins controller local file system access and Jenkins administrators to retrieve the stored password.
The latter could result in exposure of the passwords through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin 1.32.1 and newer stores the webhook secret encrypted on disk.

### Cucumber Living Documentation Plugin disabled Content-Security-Policy for archived and workspace files

**SECURITY-308
/
CVE-2018-1000144**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`cucumber-living-documentation`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/cucumber-living-documentation)**

**Description:**

Jenkins 1.641 and 1.625.3 introduced `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP headers as protection against Cross-Site Scripting attacks using workspace files and archived artifacts served using `DirectoryBrowserSupport` ([SECURITY-95](/security/advisory/2015-12-09/)).

Cucumber Living Documentation Plugin disabled this XSS protection until Jenkins was restarted whenever a Cucumber Report was viewed by any user to work around the `Content-Security-Policy` limitations.

While disabling this protection mechanism temporarily may be necessary to make plugins work that haven’t been adapted to work with the Content-Security-Policy restriction, this should only be done by administrators, as doing so may result in a security issue (see [Configuring Content Security Policy](/doc/book/security/configuring-content-security-policy)).

This has been addressed in version 1.1.0 of the plugin, and it will now request that users change the Content-Security-Policy option in Jenkins.

### Perforce Plugin uses ineffective credentials encryption

**SECURITY-373
/
CVE-2018-1000145**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`perforce`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/perforce)**

**Description:**

Perforce Plugin encrypts its credentials using DES and an encryption key stored in its public source code, so it only serves as basic obfuscation.
This allowed users with Jenkins controller local file system access and Jenkins administrators to retrieve the stored password.
The latter could result in exposure of the passwords through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
The plugin has been removed from publication at the request of its former maintainers.
We recommend that users of Perforce Plugin use the [P4 Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/p4) instead.

### vSphere Plugin does not validate SSL/TLS certificates

**SECURITY-504
/
CVE-2018-1000151**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`vsphere-cloud`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/vsphere-cloud)**

**Description:**

vSphere Plugin disabled SSL/TLS certificate validation unconditionally, allowing potential man-in-the-middle attacks.

vSphere Plugin 2.17 now has SSL/TLS certificate validation enabled by default.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in vSphere Plugin form validation allowed enumerating credentials IDs, capturing credentials, and denial of service

**SECURITY-745
/
CVE-2018-1000152 and CVE-2018-1000153**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`vsphere-cloud`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/vsphere-cloud)**

**Description:**

vSphere Plugin did not perform permission checks on methods implementing form validation.
This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to perform various actions such as:

* Connect to an attacker-specified vSphere server using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins
* Connect to configured vSphere servers and looking up information, potentially resulting in denial of service

Additionally, these form validation methods did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

These form validation methods now require POST requests and appropriate user permissions.

### Liquibase Runner Plugin allows users to load arbitrary Java code into controller JVM

**SECURITY-519
/
CVE-2018-1000146**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[high](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`liquibase-runner`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/liquibase-runner)**

**Description:**

Liquibase Runner Plugin allows users with Job/Configure permission to configure its build step in a way that loads arbitrary class files into the Jenkins controller JVM, resulting in arbitrary code execution.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Perforce Plugin credentials can be obtained by users with Job/Extended Read permission

**SECURITY-536
/
CVE-2018-1000147**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`perforce`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/perforce)**

**Description:**

Jenkins prevents users with Extended Read permission from obtaining secrets such as credentials stored in job configurations.

Perforce Plugin implements its own credential encryption using DES and an encryption key stored in its public source code.
This is not considered a secret by Jenkins, resulting in potential exposure of Perforce credentials stored in job configurations to users with Extended Read permission.
While these are encrypted, this can only be considered basic obfuscation due to the hard-coded public encryption key used.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
The plugin has been removed from publication at the request of its maintainers.
We recommend that users of Perforce Plugin use the [P4 Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/p4) instead.

### Copy To Slave Plugin allows access to arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system

**SECURITY-545
/
CVE-2018-1000148**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`copy-to-slave`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/copy-to-slave)**

**Description:**

Copy To Slave Plugin allows users with Job/Configure permissions to configure it in such a way that it allows obtaining arbitrary files accessible to the Jenkins controller process from the Jenkins controller file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Ansible Plugin disabled host key verification by default

**SECURITY-630
/
CVE-2018-1000149**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`ansible`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ansible)**

**Description:**

Ansible Plugin disabled host key verification by default, having it only as an opt-in option.

Ansible Plugin 1.0 now enables host key verification by default, adding options allowing users to opt out.

Existing configurations that previously did not opt into host key verification will have host key verification enabled after update, possibly resulting in failures.

### Reverse Proxy Auth persisted authorities cache on disk

**SECURITY-736
/
CVE-2018-1000150**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`reverse-proxy-auth-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/reverse-proxy-auth-plugin)**

**Description:**

Reverse Proxy Auth Plugin persisted a cache of granted authorities (group memberships) on disk.

This could allow users with local Jenkins controller file system access to obtain group membership information of Jenkins users.

Reverse Proxy Auth Plugin 1.6.0 and newer no longer store the cache of granted authorities on disk.

### Mailer Plugin allowed unauthorized users to send test emails

**SECURITY-774
/
CVE-2018-8718**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`mailer`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/mailer)**

**Description:**

A missing permission check in Mailer Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to have it connect to a user-specified mail server with user-specified credentials to send a test email to a user-specified email address.
The email subject and body could not be changed.
This could result in DoS if, for example, specifying a valid mail server but invalid credentials.

As the same URL did not require POST to be used, it also was vulnerable to cross-site request forgery.

The URL handling test emails now requires POST to protect from CSRF, and performs an Overall/Administer permission check.

SECURITY-261
GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin stored serialized objects in `build.xml`
files that contained the credential used to poll Jenkins. This can be used
by users with master file system access to obtain GitHub credentials.

Since 1.40.0, the plugin no longer stores serialized objects containing the
credential on disk.

Builds started before the plugin was updated to 1.40.0 will retain the
encoded credentials on disk. We strongly recommend revoking old GitHub
credentials used in Jenkins.

SECURITY-262
GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin stored the webhook secret shared between
Jenkins and GitHub in plain text.

This allowed users with Jenkins master local file system access and Jenkins
administrators to retrieve the stored password. The latter could result in
exposure of the passwords through browser extensions, cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin 1.32.1 and newer stores the webhook
secret encrypted on disk.

SECURITY-308
Cucumber Living Documentation Plugin disabled the 'Content-Security-Policy'
HTTP header XSS protection for files served by Jenkins until Jenkins was
restarted whenever a Cucumber peport was viewed by any user.

This has been addressed in version 1.1.0 of the plugin, and it will now
request that users manually change the Content-Security-Policy option in
Jenkins.

SECURITY-373
Perforce Plugin encrypts its credentials using DES and a public key stored
in its public source code, so it only serves as basic obfuscation. This
allowed users with Jenkins master local file system access and Jenkins
administrators to retrieve the stored password. The latter could result in
exposure of the passwords through browser extensions, cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix. The plugin has been
removed from publication at the request of its former maintainers.

SECURITY-504
vSphere Plugin disabled SSL/TLS certificate validation unconditionally,
allowing potential man-in-the-middle attacks.

vSphere Plugin 2.17 now has SSL/TLS certificate validation enabled by
default.

SECURITY-519
Liquibase Runner Plugin allows users with Job/Configure permission to
configure its build step in a way that loads arbitrary class files into the
Jenkins master JVM, resulting in arbitrary code execution.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-536
Perforce Plugin implements its own credential encryption using DES and an
encryption key stored in its public source code. This is not considered a
secret by Jenkins, resulting in potential exposure of Perforce credentials
stored in job configurations to users with Extended Read permission.
While these are encrypted, this can only be considered basic obfuscation
due to the hard-coded public encryption key used.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-545
Copy To Slave Plugin allows users with Job/Configure permissions to
configure it in such a way that it allows obtaining arbitrary files
accessible to the Jenkins master process from the Jenkins master file
system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-630
Ansible Plugin disabled host key verification by default, having it only as

Ansible Plugin 1.0 now enables host key verification by default, adding
options allowing users to opt out.

Existing configurations that previously did not opt into host key
verification will have host key verification enabled after update, possibly
resulting in failures.

SECURITY-736
Reverse Proxy Auth Plugin persisted a cache of granted authorities (group
memberships) on disk.

This could allow users with local Jenkins master file system access to
obtain group membership information of Jenkins users.

SECURITY-745
vSphere Plugin did not perform permission checks on methods implementing
form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to
perform various actions such as:

* Connect to an attacker-specified vSphere server using attacker-specified
  credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials
  stored in Jenkins
* Connect to configured vSphere servers and looking up information,
  potentially resulting in denial of service

Additionally, these form validation methods did not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

These form validation methods now require POST requests and appropriate
user permissions.

SECURITY-774 / CVE-2018-8718
A missing permission check in Mailer Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read
access to Jenkins to have it connect to a user-specified mail server with
user-specified credentials to send a test email to a user-specified email
address. The email subject and body could not be changed. This could result
in DoS if, for example, specifying a valid mail server but invalid
credentials.

As the same URL did not require POST to be used, it also was vulnerable to
cross-site request forgery.
