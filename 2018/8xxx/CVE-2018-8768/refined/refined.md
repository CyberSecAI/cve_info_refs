Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-8768:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Jupyter Notebook handles maliciously crafted notebook files. Specifically, after initial sanitization, jQuery attempts to "fix" invalid HTML within the notebook file, which introduces a vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate sanitization: The initial sanitization process is insufficient to prevent the injection of malicious code.
- jQuery's HTML "fixing": jQuery's attempt to correct invalid HTML after sanitization creates an opportunity for attackers to bypass the intended security measures.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript within the context of the notebook.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript within the notebook context. This can potentially lead to various malicious actions such as data theft, session hijacking, or further exploitation of the user's system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted notebook files: The attack vector is a maliciously crafted `.ipynb` notebook file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious `.ipynb` file. This could be done via social engineering, supply chain attacks, or similar means of getting a victim to open a malicious notebook file.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was present in Jupyter Notebook versions 5.4.0 and earlier.
- A fix was released in versions 5.4.1 and 5.5.
- The vulnerability was reported by vkgonka@...l.ru.
- Debian LTS advisory DLA-2432-1 addresses this vulnerability along with CVE-2018-19351 and CVE-2018-21030.
