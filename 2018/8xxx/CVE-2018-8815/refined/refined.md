Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-8815

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input file validation when handling SVG image uploads within the gallery functionality of OpenCMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is that a malicious SVG image can be uploaded and stored on the server. When another user views the image (or the image link), the malicious script embedded within the SVG is executed in the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Web Script Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session.
- **Cookie Theft:** The provided example code demonstrates the theft of user cookies, potentially leading to session hijacking and unauthorized access to the application.
- **Account Compromise:** With successful XSS, an attacker can perform actions on behalf of the victim, potentially leading to account compromise.
- **Other Malicious Activities:** The attacker can use XSS for other malicious activities like redirecting users to malicious sites, defacing the website, or injecting further malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a crafted SVG image containing malicious JavaScript code via the gallery functionality.
- **User Interaction:** The XSS payload is activated when a user (typically an administrator in this instance) views the uploaded image or clicks its link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Gallery Editor Role:** The attacker needs a user account with the 'Gallery Editor' role to upload files to the gallery.
- **Exploitation Target User with Administrator Privileges:** While the attacker uploads the file as gallery editor, the vulnerability is triggered when an administrator visits the affected page/image.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in OpenCMS version 10.5.3.
- The provided proof-of-concept SVG file includes a script tag containing `alert(document.cookie)`, which demonstrates the XSS vulnerability by displaying the user's cookies in an alert box.
- The suggested fix is input file validation which will prevent malicious scripts from being embedded inside uploaded files.
