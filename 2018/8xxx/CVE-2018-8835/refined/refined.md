Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-8835:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a double-free condition that occurs when processing specially crafted .pm3 files within the Advantech WebAccess HMI Designer software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Double Free (CWE-415):** The software attempts to free the same memory location twice, which can lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to achieve remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the processing of specially crafted `.pm3` files.
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have the ability to provide a crafted `.pm3` file to the vulnerable software.
- The attacker can be remote, and no prior authentication is required (low privilege).
- User interaction is required as the user needs to open the malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided document also mentions two other vulnerabilities affecting the same software and attack vector: a heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2018-8833) and an out-of-bounds write (CVE-2018-8837), indicating that the file parsing logic for `.pm3` files in the HMI Designer is flawed.
