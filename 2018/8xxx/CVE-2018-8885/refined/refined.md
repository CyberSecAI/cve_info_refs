Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-8885:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `screen-resolution-extra` package was using PolicyKit in an unsafe manner. Specifically, it was passing the PID of the calling process to PolicyKit for authorization instead of the system bus name.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **PID Race Condition:** The use of a PID for authorization creates a race condition. A local attacker can potentially manipulate the PID to impersonate another process and bypass PolicyKit authorization checks. This could be achieved by starting a malicious process with the same PID as an authorized one, before `screen-resolution-extra` can perform the authorization check.
*   **Insecure Authorization:** Relying on PID for authorization is inherently insecure, as PIDs are recycled and can be reused.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypass PolicyKit Authorizations:** A successful exploit allows a local attacker to bypass intended PolicyKit authorizations related to screen resolution changes managed by the `screen-resolution-extra` package.
*   **Unauthorized Screen Resolution Changes:** By bypassing PolicyKit, an attacker could potentially modify screen resolution settings without proper authorization.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
*   **PID manipulation:** The attacker manipulates process IDs to bypass authorization checks in the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system running the vulnerable software.
*   **Ability to Run Processes:** The attacker must be able to run programs/processes to manipulate PIDs.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involved passing the system bus name of the calling process to PolicyKit instead of the PID, which removes the race condition and ensures proper authorization.
*   The vulnerability was present in multiple Ubuntu releases: 17.10, 16.04 ESM, and 14.04 ESM.
