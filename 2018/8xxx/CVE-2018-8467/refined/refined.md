The provided content relates to CVE-2018-8467.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a type confusion in the Chakra JavaScript engine's JIT compiler. Specifically, the `GlobOpt::UpdateObjPtrValueType` function within the JIT compiler doesn't properly handle `Js::TypeIds_NativeIntArray` and `Js::TypeIds_NativeFloatArray` within its switch statement, leading to a type confusion.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Type confusion: Native float arrays can be incorrectly considered as objects, which causes a type confusion because the array type conversion check isn't installed for definite objects. The code does not properly check if a value is an array when optimizing operations, leading to it being treated as an object.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates the ability to cause a crash by triggering this type confusion, which constitutes a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting malicious JavaScript code that triggers the type confusion within the JIT compiler.
- The vulnerability is triggered through manipulation of an array's data type within the JIT-optimized code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to execute JavaScript code, typically by having a user visit a malicious webpage or by a compromised application using Chakra.
- The attacker needs to understand how the Chakra JIT compiler performs type optimizations.
- The attacker needs to craft a specific pattern of code that causes the type confusion.
