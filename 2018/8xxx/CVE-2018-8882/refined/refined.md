  "cve": "CVE-2018-8882",
  "description": "Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.13.02rc2 has a stack-based buffer under-read in the function ieee_shr in asm/float.c via a large shift value.",
  "affected_versions": [
    "NASM 2.13.02rc2"
  ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `ieee_shr` function within `asm/float.c`. This function performs a bitwise right shift operation on a floating-point number's mantissa. When a shift value is provided that is larger than the mantissa's length, the code attempts to access array elements with a negative index, resulting in a stack-based buffer under-read.",
     "weaknesses": [
       "Stack-based buffer under-read"
      ],
    "impact": "Exploitation could potentially lead to a crash or other undefined behavior due to memory corruption. Depending on the context and the values being read out of bounds, other impacts might be possible.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to provide a specially crafted assembly file to be processed by NASM.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have the ability to execute NASM with a malicious input file."

  "fix_details": {
    "fix_versions": [
      "nasm >= 2.14.02-3.4.1",

       "nasm >= 2.14.02-lp152.4.3.1"
     ],
    "fix_description": "The vulnerability was fixed in NASM version 2.14.02. The fix likely includes bounds checking in the `ieee_shr` function to prevent out-of-bounds memory access when handling large shift values.",
