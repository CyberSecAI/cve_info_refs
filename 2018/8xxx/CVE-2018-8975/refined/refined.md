Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-8975:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies within the `pm_mallocarray2` function in `lib/util/mallocvar.c` of the Netpbm library. This function is responsible for allocating memory for arrays used in image processing. A flaw in the memory allocation logic leads to a heap-based buffer over-read when handling a crafted image file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-based Buffer Over-read:** The core issue is that `pm_mallocarray2` reads beyond the allocated buffer on the heap when processing a malformed image file, specifically when the number of columns is zero or a negative number.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service. By providing a specially crafted image file, an attacker can trigger the buffer over-read, causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Image File:** The attack vector involves supplying a malicious image file to a Netpbm tool (such as `pbmmask`). The malformed data within the image triggers the vulnerability during processing, leading to the buffer over-read and DoS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Supply Input:** An attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted image file as input to a vulnerable Netpbm tool. This could be achieved through various means such as a web application, email attachment, or any other interface that allows image processing.
- **No authentication is required.**

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs specifically in `pm_mallocarray2` which calls `allocRowHeap`, which in turn calls `mallocz`. The vulnerability exists when the number of columns or rows is 0, and the code does not check if the col is greater than zero before doing `col - 1` on multiple places.
-  The `pbmmask` tool is cited as a demonstration of this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability has been addressed in Netpbm version 10.93.00.
- The vulnerability was rated as having "low" severity by SUSE.
- Patches for various distributions have been released and are referenced in the provided content.
