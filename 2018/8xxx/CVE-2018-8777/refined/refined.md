Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information regarding CVE-2018-8777:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper handling of large HTTP requests with oversized headers in WEBrick, a web server bundled with Ruby.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** WEBrick attempts to process extremely large HTTP header requests in memory. This can lead to excessive memory consumption and ultimately a denial-of-service condition.
*  **Out-of-Memory:**  The large headers overwhelm the server, causing it to run out of available memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** A successful exploit renders the server unavailable by causing it to crash or become unresponsive due to memory exhaustion.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** An attacker sends a crafted HTTP request over the network to a WEBrick server.
*   **Malicious HTTP Request:** The crafted request includes extremely large HTTP headers designed to consume excessive server memory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to send the malicious request to the vulnerable server.
*   **No Authentication Required**: No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Basic understanding of HTTP protocol:** Understanding how to craft a malicious HTTP request with large headers is necessary for a successful exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Ruby, including 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6.
*   Several Linux distributions addressed this vulnerability in their respective security updates.
*   The fixes for this vulnerability generally involve sanitizing the headers before processing them or by using a different approach to processing the HTTP body to avoid large in-memory allocation.
