The provided content discusses a fuzzing effort on Adobe Reader using WinAFL, which resulted in the discovery of 53 CVEs, including CVE-2018-8464. However, it does not provide specific details about the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-8464.

Based on the provided text, the following general information can be extracted:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerabilities were found through fuzzing various parsers within Adobe Reader, specifically targeting file format parsing, such as that of the JPEG2000 (JP2K) format. The fuzzing process involved injecting malformed data into the parser which would cause a crash. 
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerabilities are related to flaws in the parsing logic of various file formats within Adobe Reader. This includes how the reader handles malformed or unexpected input in the JP2K parser and other components that parse image formats and other stream decoders.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to crashes within the Adobe Reader sandbox. Further exploitation may lead to arbitrary code execution (this is mentioned as a possibility but not explicitly linked to the identified CVE).
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves supplying malformed data, such as a specially crafted JP2K file, to the vulnerable parsers within Adobe Reader through a PDF file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to create a malicious file (e.g., a crafted PDF containing a malformed JP2K image) that, when processed by the Adobe Reader, will trigger the vulnerability. The attacker needs no prior access or privileges on the victim machine.

The content focuses on the methodology for discovering the vulnerabilities rather than providing specifics for each CVE, including CVE-2018-8464.
