Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities, which are related to CVE-2018-8936:

**Vulnerability Overview**

The vulnerabilities affect the AMD Secure Processor (PSP) firmware and the "Promontory" chipset used in some AMD platforms. These are not related to the "Zen" CPU architecture or the Google Project Zero exploits from January 3, 2018.

**Vulnerability Groups:**

1.  **MASTERKEY and PSP Privilege Escalation (AMD Secure Processor firmware):**
    *   **Root Cause:**  Lack of proper checks when updating the PSP firmware, allowing an attacker to bypass signature verification and install corrupted firmware.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Insufficient integrity checks of firmware updates.
    *  **Impact:** Persistent compromise of the platform's security controls even after reboot.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Requires administrative access to the system to initiate the BIOS update.

2.  **RYZENFALL and FALLOUT (AMD Secure Processor firmware):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Vulnerabilities in the API between the x86 processor and the AMD Secure Processor (PSP).
    *   **Weaknesses:** Exploitable interfaces between x86 and PSP.
    *   **Impact:** Circumvention of platform security controls, and potential installation of malware in System Management Mode (SMM). This attack is not persistent across reboots.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Requires administrative access to the system to write to specific PSP registers.

3.  **CHIMERA ("Promontory" chipset):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Exposed functions in the Promontory chipset that can be abused by a malicious driver.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Insecure chipset interfaces.
    *   **Impact:** Access to physical memory through the chipset, installation of malware in the chipset (not persistent across reboots).
    *  **Attack Vector:** Requires administrative access to install a malicious driver.

**General Characteristics and Impacts:**

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: All of these vulnerabilities require the attacker to have administrative access to the system. This means the attacker must be able to execute code with elevated privileges on the target machine. For MASTERKEY, the attacker must also be able to perform a BIOS update and reboot.
*   **Impacts Beyond Specific Vulnerabilities**:
    *   Code execution in PSP and SMM, which is typically invisible to common security products.
    *   Persistence across OS reinstalls and potentially BIOS updates for MASTERKEY.
    *   Ability to block or infect BIOS updates, potentially bricking devices (MASTERKEY).
    *   Bypassing security mechanisms like Windows Credential Guard, Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV), and Secure Boot, and attacks to security features on top of PSP (e.g. fTPM).

**Mitigations:**

*   AMD is developing firmware patches to be released through BIOS updates for the PSP related vulnerabilities.
*   Mitigation patches are being developed for the "Promontory" chipset with help from the chipset's third-party provider.
*   No performance impact is expected from these patches.

**Additional Notes**

*   Trail of Bits, an independent security research firm, confirmed the technical accuracy of the vulnerabilities based on documentation and proof-of-concept code provided by CTS Labs.
*   While the vulnerabilities are technically significant, exploitation requires considerable effort, making immediate risk to most users low.
*   These vulnerabilities stem from common programming errors, unclear security boundaries, and insufficient security testing.

**In summary:**

These vulnerabilities allow an attacker with admin access to bypass security mechanisms by exploiting flaws in the PSP firmware and chipset, which could lead to a persistent compromise in the case of the MASTERKEY vulnerability.
