Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2018-8784:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how FreeRDP handles stream encodings during the decompression process of the ZGFX graphics pipeline. Specifically, a heap-based buffer overflow occurs within the `zgfx_decompress_segment()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-Based Buffer Overflow:** A buffer overflow occurs on the heap due to insufficient checks when decompressing data.
*   **Integer Overflow/Truncation:**  While not the primary vulnerability, the code includes checks that are vulnerable to integer truncation/overflow that could lead to the buffer overflow. Specifically, a check for `segmentSize > UINT32_MAX` was added to prevent an integer overflow leading to an undersized allocation.  Without this check, an attacker can cause an allocation of memory much smaller than expected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** A malicious RDP server can cause the FreeRDP client to corrupt memory on the heap.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The memory corruption can lead to arbitrary code execution on the client system.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A crash can occur, resulting in denial of service for the client.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious RDP Server:** The attacker needs to control a malicious RDP server. The client connects to this server.
*   **Manipulated Stream Encoding:** The malicious server sends crafted ZGFX stream encodings to the client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to set up or compromise an RDP server that the victim connects to.
*   **RDP Server Control:**  The attacker needs full control of the RDP server to manipulate the stream encoding sent to the client.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability is present in FreeRDP versions prior to 2.0.0-rc4.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Eyal Itkin from Check Point Software Technologies.
*   A patch for the vulnerability has been released in FreeRDP 2.0.0-rc4 and later versions.
*   The provided information indicates the patch was a commit to `libfreerdp/codec/zgfx.c`. This commit included checks to ensure that a segmentSize parameter is a valid size.

This vulnerability is related to other FreeRDP vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-8785, CVE-2018-8786, CVE-2018-8787, CVE-2018-8788, CVE-2018-8789) found by the same researcher. The other CVEs include issues such as integer overflows and out-of-bounds access in various parts of the FreeRDP codebase, all exploitable via a malicious RDP server.
