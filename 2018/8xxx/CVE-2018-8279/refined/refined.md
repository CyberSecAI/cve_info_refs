Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-8279:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a type confusion issue within the Microsoft Chakra JavaScript engine. Specifically, incorrect bytecode is generated when parsing invalid JavaScript code involving `async` functions, classes, and `await` expressions within a computed property of a class. This leads to a `yield` operation being performed inside a `try-catch` block, which is not supposed to happen.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Bytecode Generation:** Chakra generates flawed bytecode when parsing a particular JavaScript construct.
- **Type Confusion:** The incorrectly generated bytecode allows a yield operation within a try-catch which leads to type confusion within the `InterpreterStackFrame::OP_ResumeYield` method.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability leads to a crash of the Chakra engine, causing a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing crafted JavaScript code in Microsoft Edge or other applications utilizing Chakra.
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates the vulnerable construct and how to trigger the crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to supply the crafted Javascript to an application that uses the Chakra Javascript engine (e.g. Microsoft Edge).
- No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit-db entry includes a detailed explanation of the generated bytecode and the location of the error.
- The vulnerability is triggered due to an invalid construct that involves class definitions, async functions, and await expressions inside a computed property.
- The PoC uses `parseFloat.bind` as a spray to possibly improve reliability/exploitability.

The exploit-db entry provides more details than the standard CVE description, which is a placeholder in this case.
