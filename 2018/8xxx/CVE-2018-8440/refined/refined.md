{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Task Scheduler's `SchRpcSetSecurity` method fails to impersonate the requesting client when setting the security descriptor. This allows a low-privileged user to modify the access control list (ACL) of a file or folder as the Local System user.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper impersonation in `SchRpcSetSecurity` method.",
      "Task Scheduler performs `SchRpcSetSecurity` on hard links."
    ],
    "impact": "A local unprivileged user can change permissions of any file on the system, leading to arbitrary file modification and subsequent local privilege escalation by replacing system executables.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "A low-privileged user creates a hard link to a system file.",
        "The user calls the Task Scheduler's `SchRpcSetSecurity` method via ALPC to modify the hard link.",
        "The user replaces the linked-to system file with a malicious one.",
        "A privileged process loads and executes the modified system file."
      ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A local, unprivileged user can execute code on the system."
