{
  "CVE-2018-8977": {
    "description": "The vulnerability exists in the `Exiv2::Internal::printCsLensFFFF` function within `canonmn_int.cpp`. This function is responsible for processing metadata from Canon cameras. An invalid memory access occurs due to an attempt to dereference an invalid pointer.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause is an attempt to dereference a pointer at an invalid memory location when handling specific Canon maker note data within the `printCsLensFFFF` function. The code incorrectly calculates or retrieves an address, leading to the segmentation fault.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Invalid memory access",
      "Null pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (application crash) by providing a crafted image file containing specific Canon metadata that triggers the faulty code path.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is through processing a specially crafted image file containing malicious Canon maker note metadata using the exiv2 utility or library.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted image file to the vulnerable software (exiv2)."
