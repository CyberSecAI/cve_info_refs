Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in Exploit-DB entry 45571, which is related to CVE-2018-8466:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how the Chakra JIT engine in Microsoft Edge performs a check called `BailOutOnInvalidatedArrayHeadSegment`. This check is designed to ensure that an object is still a valid array before performing certain operations. The check relies on comparing the object's vtable with known vtable addresses of JavascriptArray, JavascriptNativeIntArray, and JavascriptNativeFloatArray.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is that the `BailOutOnInvalidatedArrayHeadSegment` check can be bypassed. This is because wrapping an object with the `CrossSite` class replaces the original object's vtable, causing the check to fail and incorrectly assume the object is not an array. This allows an attacker to modify the length of the array without triggering a bailout, leading to type confusion when subsequent operations are performed on the array

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The immediate impact of this vulnerability, as demonstrated by the provided proof-of-concept (PoC), is a denial of service (DoS). By bypassing the bailout check and manipulating array properties, an attacker can force a type conversion in-place which causes a crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves crafting malicious JavaScript code that:
1. Creates a JavaScript array.
2. Creates a cross-site object using an iframe which modifies the vtable
3. Assigns the array to a property of the cross-site object, effectively replacing the vtable for the array.
4. Modifies the length property of the array, which would normally trigger a bailout. However due to the modified vtable, the bail out check does not get triggered
5. Performs further operations on the array which then leads to a type confusion crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code within the context of a vulnerable Microsoft Edge browser. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
- Hosting a malicious webpage.
- Embedding the code in a website or application that uses the vulnerable browser.
- Exploiting cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

In summary, the vulnerability stems from an inadequate vtable check within the Chakra JIT engine, allowing an attacker to bypass crucial safety checks and induce type confusion by modifying array properties and causing a crash.
