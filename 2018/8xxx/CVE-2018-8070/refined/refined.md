Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-8070:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization when handling the `title` parameter in the `/guest/index.html` URI of the Qcms version 3.0 application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to stored XSS. Specifically, it does not sanitize the `title` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Admin Cookie Theft:** When an administrator views the feedback containing the malicious payload within the admin panel, the injected JavaScript code executes in the admin's browser context. This allows an attacker to potentially steal the administrator's cookies, which can lead to session hijacking and full access to the administrative interface.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the admin user's session. This code can potentially perform other malicious activities such as redirecting the admin, changing settings, or performing other unauthorized actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker submits a POST request to `/guest/index.html` with a crafted payload in the `title` parameter. Specifically, the provided example uses `<svg/onload=alert('qcms')>` which will trigger an alert dialog when rendered in a browser.
- This payload is then stored by the application and rendered within the admin interface when an administrator views the feedback.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to submit feedback through the guest interface of the Qcms application, specifically sending POST requests to `/guest/index.html`.
- The attacker does not need to have any administrative access to inject the payload.
- The attacker needs to be able to entice an administrator to view the crafted feedback within the admin panel for the XSS payload to execute.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes a demonstration of the attack by including the malicious payload within the `title` parameter of the POST request.
- The content also shows screenshots of the successful alert box being shown, demonstrating the vulnerability.
