- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper authorization in the SYNO.Cal.Event component of the Synology Calendar application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization when creating calendar events, specifically via the `cal_id` or `original_cal_id` parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote authenticated users can exploit this vulnerability to create arbitrary calendar events. This could lead to unauthorized modifications of calendar data, potentially disrupting schedules or injecting misleading information.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). The attacker must be authenticated (PR:L), and no user interaction is required (UI:N) for successful exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a remote, authenticated user on the Synology Calendar application.
