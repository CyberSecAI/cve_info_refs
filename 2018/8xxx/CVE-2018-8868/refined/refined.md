- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Medtronic MyCareLink Patient Monitor contains debug code that allows for reading and writing arbitrary memory values to implantable cardiac devices via inductive or short range wireless protocols.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposed dangerous method or function (CWE-749).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with physical access and close proximity to an implantable cardiac device can use the debug functionality to read and write arbitrary memory values to that device.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical access to the device is required to access the debug functionality. Close physical proximity to the target implantable cardiac device is also needed to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attacker requires physical access to the device and the ability to apply other vulnerabilities described in the advisory to access the debug functionality. Also, the attacker must be in close physical proximity to a target implantable cardiac device.
