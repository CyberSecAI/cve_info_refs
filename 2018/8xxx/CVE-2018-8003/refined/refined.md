The provided content relates to CVE-2018-8003.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is a path traversal vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A directory traversal vulnerability exists in Ambari, allowing access to files outside the intended directory. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of file paths in HTTP requests.

**Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can read any file on the filesystem of the host where the Ambari Server is running, provided the user the Ambari Server is running as has the necessary permissions. This could expose sensitive information, configuration files, or other critical data.

**Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious HTTP request with a manipulated file path to access files outside of the intended directories.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs direct network access to the Ambari Server. No authentication is needed.
