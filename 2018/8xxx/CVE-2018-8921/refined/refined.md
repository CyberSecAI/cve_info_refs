- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of user-controlled input in the "File Sharing Notify Toast" functionality within Synology Drive, specifically when handling file names.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A remote, authenticated attacker can inject arbitrary web script or HTML. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions within the context of the victim's browser when they interact with a notification related to the manipulated file.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, requiring a remote, authenticated user. The attacker injects malicious code through a file name. This malicious file name is then displayed in a notification, triggering the XSS vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of Synology Drive and must have the ability to create or rename files to inject a malicious file name. The attacker requires the victim to interact with the malicious notification.
