Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-8035:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is insufficient filtering of user-supplied inputs by the JavaScript code within the Apache UIMA DUCC webserver. This allows for the unintended execution of user-supplied JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a reflected XSS, where user-supplied data is rendered within the web page without proper sanitization, enabling the execution of arbitrary JavaScript.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the web page. This could lead to various impacts, including:
    *   **Data theft:** Stealing cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
    *   **Website defacement:** Modifying the appearance or content of the web page.
    *   **Malware distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or downloading malware.
    *   **Account hijacking:** Taking control of a user's account.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript code through user-supplied inputs within the Apache UIMA DUCC web interface. This implies the attack is likely triggered through a web request that contains the malicious javascript.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker would need to be able to inject data that will be reflected in a response rendered by the vulnerable webserver. No specific user position or specific capabilities are noted beyond the ability to craft and send a malicious request to the web server.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability resides in the Apache UIMA DUCC webserver.
* The official CVE description is missing, but this analysis provides the information based on the UIMA website's security report.
* The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.0.0 and later of Apache UIMA DUCC.
