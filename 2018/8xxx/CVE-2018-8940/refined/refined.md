```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application allows an unauthenticated user to control the resource the application will load, and parses it as an XML document. DTDs are allowed, enabling XXE attacks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "XML External Entity (XXE) Injection",
    "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
    "Information Disclosure (Local File Check)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read local files, perform SSRF attacks, and exfiltrate data via XXE.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `clientInstallationServiceXmlPath` parameter in the `GetWcfBase` API endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be unauthenticated and needs to send a GET request to the vulnerable endpoint. For XXE, the attacker needs to host a malicious XML file on a reachable server."
