I‚Äôm using categories and tags to filter my products. From 10+ plugins I tried (including paid version), HUSKY is the only one I found that provides something very simple. Multiple checks filter (e.g you can check Cat1 + Tag1 + Tag2 and it will show only posts/products who are in Cat1 AND Tag1 AND Tag2. To be honest I was kinda shocked how many of the plugins which you can find don‚Äôt provide that.HUSKY does, it is easy to set up, so 5/5 from me!

The plugin works fine, but styling is a pain as much as documentation. Free and Pro versions have the same problem

The plugin overrides the entire product collection block with a copy of the default WooCommerce version. Any customizations, even basic CSS adjustments, need to be re-applied with their (Woof, Husky, or whatever their name is) cloned version of WooCommerce‚Äôs defaults, which are potentially outdated. Even custom translations are somehow overridden (meaning they‚Äôre using their own translation context rather than, e.g., woocommerce).This breaks too many customizations to make the plugin a good fit.

I can‚Äôt believe that Woocommerce doesn‚Äôt have good product filter plugin. I‚Äôve try every popular plugin on market with that one and every one of them have bigger or smaller problems, but it cannot be usefull on simple ecommerce shop.
