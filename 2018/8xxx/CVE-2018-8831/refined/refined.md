Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-8831

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a failure to properly sanitize user input within the web interface of Kodi, specifically when creating playlists. This allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML/script code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The injected malicious script is stored within the application (in the playlist), leading to persistent XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML or script code within the victim's browser.
- This can be leveraged to steal sensitive information, including user credentials and personal data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is the web interface of Kodi.
- An attacker can inject malicious code into a playlist's name/description during the creation process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create playlists within the Kodi instance. This suggests that they would need some level of access to the Kodi instance itself or its web interface.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable input field where they can inject the XSS payload.
