Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2018-8097:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content includes a commit diff for `eve/io/mongo/parser.py` which modifies how the `datetime` function is handled within the MongoDB query parser. This aligns with the general description of CVE-2018-8097, which involves a vulnerability in the way a query parser handles certain functions, potentially leading to code execution.

**2. Root cause of the vulnerability:**

The root cause is the use of `eval()` to process the `datetime` function call within the MongoDB query.

Specifically, this code:
```python
if expr:
    self.current\_value = eval(node.func.id + expr)
```
constructs a string representing the `datetime` function call with arguments and then uses `eval` to execute it. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code if they can control the arguments passed to the `datetime` function.

The commit fixes this by attempting to directly construct the datetime object via:
```python
self.current_value = datetime(*values)
```

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The use of `eval()` allows arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the input, specifically the arguments to the `datetime` function.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary Python code on the server running the Eve application. This could potentially lead to complete system compromise or data breach.

**5. Attack vectors:**

- **Malicious MongoDB Queries:** An attacker would need to craft a malicious MongoDB query that includes a carefully crafted `datetime` function call within a filter, so that it contains malicious arguments.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Ability to submit queries:** The attacker must be able to submit queries to the Eve API, and specifically, have control over the filter parameters.
- **Understanding of query parsing:** The attacker needs to understand how the MongoDB query parser works to inject malicious code within the function's arguments.
