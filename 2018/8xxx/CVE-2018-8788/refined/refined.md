  "response": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds write in the `nsc_rle_decode()` function within FreeRDP. This function is responsible for decoding data compressed using run-length encoding (RLE) within the Network Security Channel (NSC).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds write: The `nsc_rle_decode()` function does not properly validate the size of the input data, leading to a potential write outside the allocated buffer."
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit of this vulnerability can lead to memory corruption, potentially allowing for remote code execution. This could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious RDP server can send crafted RLE-compressed data to a vulnerable FreeRDP client. The client then attempts to decode this data using the vulnerable `nsc_rle_decode()` function, triggering the out-of-bounds write.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control or be in a position to man-in-the-middle an RDP server the victim is connecting to. No authentication or user interaction from the victim is required."
