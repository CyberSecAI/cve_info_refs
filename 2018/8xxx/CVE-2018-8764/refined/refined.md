Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-8764:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the inclusion of a CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) token within the URL parameters of the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF Token Exposure:** The primary weakness is that the CSRF token, intended for protection against CSRF attacks, is exposed in the URL. This makes it accessible through various channels such as browser history, server logs, proxy logs, on-screen display, bookmarks, emails, and the Referer header.
- **Sensitive Information Leakage:** By placing the CSRF token in the URL, the application leaks sensitive information, which can then be exploited by an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **CSRF Attacks:** An attacker can leverage the leaked CSRF token to conduct a Cross-Site Request Forgery attack. This allows the attacker to force a logged-in user of the application to perform unwanted actions on the application by tricking them into clicking on a malicious link crafted by the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Links:** An attacker crafts a malicious link containing a valid CSRF token obtained from a legitimate user's session.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker entices the victim to click on the malicious link, which triggers the CSRF attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of the application:** The attacker needs to understand the application's structure and how it handles CSRF tokens.
- **Ability to craft malicious links:** The attacker needs the ability to create and disseminate links that exploit the vulnerability.
- **Victim Interaction:** The attacker requires the victim to be logged into the application and to click the malicious link.
