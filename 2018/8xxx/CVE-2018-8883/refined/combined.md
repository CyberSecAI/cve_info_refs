Short answer: Yes.  Long answer: NASM unit tests are mostly focused on regression detection. What they are suppose to be used for,  1. make 2. make golden 3. <do changes here> 4. make 5. make test  The `make test` then compares output of the "golden" output with the test run. If there are any changes, it *could* indicate a regression that need to be investigated.  The "golden" directory of binaries is not shipped by upstream that's why it's complaining. But nasm is called before the attempted comparison so if there is some major nasm failure on execution, like segfault, I think we would see it in the log. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1084631#c6)  jun wang   2020-07-01 08:59:38 UTC  ``` (In reply to Adam Majer from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1084631#c5)) > (In reply to jun wang from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1084631#c4)) > > I am testing nasm update, and when checking the url > > [https://build.suse.de/build/SUSE:Maintenance:15602/SUSE_SLE-15_Update/x86_64/](https://build.suse.de/build/SUSE%3AMaintenance%3A15602/SUSE_SLE-15_Update/x86_64/) > > nasm.SUSE_SLE-15_Update/_log, I get many these output:  > >  > > [   95s] cd test && perl -I./perllib -I. performtest.pl --nasm=../nasm *.asm > > [   95s] Can't compare at _file_/bin file stdout > > [   95s] Can't compare at _version/version file stdout > > [   95s] Can't compare at a32offs/unoptimized file a32offs.bin > > [   95s] Can't compare at a32offs/optimized file a32offs.bin > >  > > is this OK? >  > Short answer: Yes. >  > Long answer: NASM unit tests are mostly focused on regression detection. > What they are suppose to be used for, >  > 1. make > 2. make golden > 3. <do changes here> > 4. make > 5. make test >  > The `make test` then compares output of the "golden" output with the test > run.

An update that solves 13 vulnerabilities and has one errata
is now available.
Description:
This update for nasm fixes the following issues:
nasm was updated to version 2.14.02.
This allows building of Mozilla Firefox 78ESR and also contains lots of
bugfixes, security fixes and improvements.
\* Fix crash due to multiple errors or warnings during the code generation
pass if a list file is specified.
\* Create all system-defined macros defore processing command-line given
preprocessing directives (-p, -d, -u, --pragma, --before).
\* If debugging is enabled, define a \_\_DEBUG\_FORMAT\_\_ predefined macro. See
section 4.11.7.
\* Fix an assert for the case in the obj format when a SEG operator refers
to an EXTERN symbol declared further down in the code.
\* Fix a corner case in the floating-point code where a binary, octal or
hexadecimal floating-point having at least 32, 11, or 8 mantissa digits
could produce slightly incorrect results under very specific conditions.
\* Support -MD without a filename, for gcc compatibility. -MF can be used
to set the dependencies output filename. See section 2.1.7.
\* Fix -E in combination with -MD. See section 2.1.21.
\* Fix missing errors on redefined labels; would cause convergence failure
instead which is very slow and not easy to debug.
\* Duplicate definitions of the same label with the same value is now
explicitly permitted (2.14 would allow it in some circumstances.)
\* Add the option --no-line to ignore %line directives in the source. See
section 2.1.33 and section 4.10.1.
\* Changed -I option semantics by adding a trailing path separator
unconditionally.
\* Fixed null dereference in corrupted invalid single line macros.
\* Fixed division by zero which may happen if source code is malformed.
\* Fixed out of bound access in processing of malformed segment override.
\* Fixed out of bound access in certain EQU parsing.
\* Fixed buffer underflow in float parsing.
\* Added SGX (Intel Software Guard Extensions) instructions.
\* Added +n syntax for multiple contiguous registers.
\* Fixed subsections\_via\_symbols for macho object format.
\* Added the --gprefix, --gpostfix, --lprefix, and --lpostfix command line
options, to allow command line base symbol renaming. See section 2.1.28.
\* Allow label renaming to be specified by %pragma in addition to from the
command line. See section 6.9.
\* Supported generic %pragma namespaces, output and debug. See section 6.10.
\* Added the --pragma command line option to inject a %pragma directive.
See section 2.1.29.
\* Added the --before command line option to accept preprocess statement
before input. See section 2.1.30.
\* Added AVX512 VBMI2 (Additional Bit Manipulation), VNNI (Vector Neural
Network), BITALG (Bit Algorithm), and GFNI (Galois Field New
Instruction) instructions.
\* Added the STATIC directive for local symbols that should be renamed
using global-symbol rules. See section 6.8.
\* Allow a symbol to be defined as EXTERN and then later overridden as
GLOBAL or COMMON. Furthermore, a symbol declared EXTERN and then defined
will be treated as GLOBAL. See section 6.5.
\* The GLOBAL directive no longer is required to precede the definition of
the symbol.
\* Support private\_extern as macho specific extension to the GLOBAL
directive. See section 7.8.5.
\* Updated UD0 encoding to match with the specification
\* Added the --limit-X command line option to set execution limits. See
section 2.1.31.
\* Updated the Codeview version number to be aligned with MASM.
\* Added the --keep-all command line option to preserve output files. See
section 2.1.32.
\* Added the --include command line option, an alias to -P (section 2.1.18).
\* Added the --help command line option as an alias to -h (section 3.1).
\* Added -W, -D, and -Q suffix aliases for RET instructions so the operand
sizes of these instructions can be encoded without using o16, o32 or o64.
New upstream version 2.13.03:
\* Add flags: AES, VAES, VPCLMULQDQ
\* Add VPCLMULQDQ instruction
\* elf: Add missing dwarf loc section
\* documentation updates

An update that solves 13 vulnerabilities and has one errata
is now available.
Description:
This update for nasm fixes the following issues:
nasm was updated to version 2.14.02.
This allows building of Mozilla Firefox 78ESR and also contains lots of
bugfixes, security fixes and improvements.
\* Fix crash due to multiple errors or warnings during the code generation
pass if a list file is specified.
\* Create all system-defined macros defore processing command-line given
preprocessing directives (-p, -d, -u, --pragma, --before).
\* If debugging is enabled, define a \_\_DEBUG\_FORMAT\_\_ predefined macro. See
section 4.11.7.
\* Fix an assert for the case in the obj format when a SEG operator refers
to an EXTERN symbol declared further down in the code.
\* Fix a corner case in the floating-point code where a binary, octal or
hexadecimal floating-point having at least 32, 11, or 8 mantissa digits
could produce slightly incorrect results under very specific conditions.
\* Support -MD without a filename, for gcc compatibility. -MF can be used
to set the dependencies output filename. See section 2.1.7.
\* Fix -E in combination with -MD. See section 2.1.21.
\* Fix missing errors on redefined labels; would cause convergence failure
instead which is very slow and not easy to debug.
\* Duplicate definitions of the same label with the same value is now
explicitly permitted (2.14 would allow it in some circumstances.)
\* Add the option --no-line to ignore %line directives in the source. See
section 2.1.33 and section 4.10.1.
\* Changed -I option semantics by adding a trailing path separator
unconditionally.
\* Fixed null dereference in corrupted invalid single line macros.
\* Fixed division by zero which may happen if source code is malformed.
\* Fixed out of bound access in processing of malformed segment override.
\* Fixed out of bound access in certain EQU parsing.
\* Fixed buffer underflow in float parsing.
\* Added SGX (Intel Software Guard Extensions) instructions.
\* Added +n syntax for multiple contiguous registers.
\* Fixed subsections\_via\_symbols for macho object format.
\* Added the --gprefix, --gpostfix, --lprefix, and --lpostfix command line
options, to allow command line base symbol renaming. See section 2.1.28.
\* Allow label renaming to be specified by %pragma in addition to from the
command line. See section 6.9.
\* Supported generic %pragma namespaces, output and debug. See section 6.10.
\* Added the --pragma command line option to inject a %pragma directive.

\* Added the --before command line option to accept preprocess statement
before input. See section 2.1.30.
\* Added AVX512 VBMI2 (Additional Bit Manipulation), VNNI (Vector Neural
Network), BITALG (Bit Algorithm), and GFNI (Galois Field New
Instruction) instructions.
\* Added the STATIC directive for local symbols that should be renamed

\* Allow a symbol to be defined as EXTERN and then later overridden as
GLOBAL or COMMON. Furthermore, a symbol declared EXTERN and then defined
will be treated as GLOBAL. See section 6.5.
\* The GLOBAL directive no longer is required to precede the definition of
the symbol.
\* Support private\_extern as macho specific extension to the GLOBAL
directive. See section 7.8.5.
\* Updated UD0 encoding to match with the specification
\* Added the --limit-X command line option to set execution limits. See
section 2.1.31.
\* Updated the Codeview version number to be aligned with MASM.
\* Added the --keep-all command line option to preserve output files. See
