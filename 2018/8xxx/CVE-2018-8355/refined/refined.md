  "CVE-2018-8355": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability is due to a type confusion error in the Chakra JavaScript engine's handling of the `localeCompare` method. When the `localeCompare` method is inlined with only one argument, it can call JavaScript or C++ code. The C++ version calls the JavaScript version when internationalization (Intl) is enabled, but it does not update the ImplicitCallFlags. This allows JavaScript code to execute without touching the ImplicitCallFlags, which can lead to exploitation through the `toString` method override.",
    "Root cause": "Type confusion in the handling of the `localeCompare` method within the Chakra JavaScript engine. The JavaScript and C++ implementations of the method do not correctly manage state flags when inlining occurs.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Type confusion",
      "Improper handling of state flags",
      "Inconsistent behavior between JavaScript and C++ implementations",
       "Lack of proper profiling of all code paths"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (DoS) by causing a type confusion that can lead to unexpected behavior and potential crashes.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by calling the String.prototype.localeCompare method with a crafted object as an argument.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code within the context of a vulnerable application (e.g., Microsoft Edge browser). Specifically, the attacker needs to control the `toString` method of an object passed to the `localeCompare` function, and trigger the inlined version of `localeCompare`.",
   "Additional details": "The exploit leverages the fact that the JavaScript version of `localeCompare` may not update `ImplicitCallFlags` when inlined, which differs from the C++ version. This allows the attacker to control the execution flow by using a specially crafted object that throws an exception in its toString method to avoid profiling a specific branch. Subsequently, when the `toString` method is called again, it can corrupt the system or cause a crash by assigning a non-numeric value to a numeric array."
