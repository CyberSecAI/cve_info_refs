Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-8024:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Apache Spark's UI handles URLs, allowing a malicious user to craft a URL that, when accessed, can execute script within the context of the user's view of the Spark UI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The Spark UI doesn't properly sanitize or validate URL parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the web browser of a user who accesses the malicious URL.
- This could potentially expose sensitive information or allow further malicious actions within the user's session on the Spark UI.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a specially crafted URL pointing to a Spark cluster's UI job and stage info pages.
- The attacker tricks a user into clicking on the malicious URL, leading to script execution in the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that exploits the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to trick the victim user into accessing this malicious URL while having the user authenticated in the Spark UI.

**Affected Versions:**
- Spark 2.1.0 through 2.1.2
- Spark 2.2.0 through 2.2.1
- Spark 2.3.0

**Mitigation:**
- Users of affected versions should upgrade to the following versions or newer:
    - 2.1.x users should upgrade to 2.1.3 or newer
    - 2.2.x users should upgrade to 2.2.2 or newer
    - 2.3.x users should upgrade to 2.3.1 or newer

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is browser-dependent. While some modern browsers (e.g., recent versions of Chrome and Safari) might block the attack, others like Firefox (at the time of discovery) are vulnerable.
