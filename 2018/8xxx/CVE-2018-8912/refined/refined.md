- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to XSS through the `commit_msg` parameter in `SYNO.NoteStation.Note`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web script or HTML, potentially leading to actions within the context of the victim's session, like data theft, session hijacking, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by injecting malicious script or HTML via the `commit_msg` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must be a remote, authenticated user.
    - The user interaction is required since the injected scripts will only execute when a victim views the content.
