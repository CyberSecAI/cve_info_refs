The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in ManageEngine Endpoint Central, but it does not directly relate to CVE-2018-8722, as this CVE is a placeholder.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding, allowing attackers to inject malicious client-side scripts into the web page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web application. This can lead to a variety of attacks, as described below.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Client-side script injection:** Attackers can execute malicious JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser when they access a page containing the injected script.
* **Session hijacking:** Attackers can steal cookies or other session data, allowing them to impersonate the user.
* **Phishing:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites or display fake login forms, stealing credentials.
* **Malware distribution:** Attackers could use the injected scripts to redirect users to malware download locations, leading to infection.
* **Defacement:** Attackers can modify the appearance of the web page, altering the content seen by the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
* Remote attackers can inject client-side scripts by exploiting vulnerable input fields or URL parameters of Endpoint Central.
* The exact method of injection is not described in detail but could be any place user-provided data is reflected on the web page without proper sanitization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to identify a vulnerable entry point that reflects user input.
* The attacker must be able to craft malicious script code.
* No special system privileges or access is necessary as the XSS vulnerability is exploited via userâ€™s browser.

The provided information indicates the issue was fixed in build 92026, released March 9th, 2016, and that a previous XSS vulnerability was fixed in build 90128 released Jan 22nd 2015.
