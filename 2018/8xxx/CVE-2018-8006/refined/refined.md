- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper data filtering of the `QueueFilter` parameter in the web-based administration console.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into the web console, which could be executed by other users who access the same console. This could lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the `QueueFilter` parameter in the URL when accessing the `queue.jsp` page of the ActiveMQ web console.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL that contains the XSS payload within the `QueueFilter` parameter. They do not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
