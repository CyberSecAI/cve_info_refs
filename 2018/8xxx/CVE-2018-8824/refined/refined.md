Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-8824:

**1. Verification:**

*   The content explicitly mentions "CVE-2018-8824 SQL Injection in Prestashop" and provides details aligning with SQL injection. Therefore, the content is relevant.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization/validation of user-supplied input in the `ajax_phpcode.php` file of the `Responsive Mega Menu (Horizontal+Vertical+Dropdown) Pro` module for PrestaShop. Specifically, the `code` parameter in both `$_POST` and `$_GET` is directly used in a SQL query without proper escaping or sanitization.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw due to unsanitized user input being directly used within a SQL query.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

*   **High Impact:** The vulnerability has a high impact because it allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    *   **Data Breach:** Access to sensitive database information.
    *   **Data Modification:** Modification or deletion of data within the database.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Rendering the website/application unstable.

**5. Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The provided proof of concept shows exploitation through an HTTP GET request with a malicious `code` parameter value.
*   **HTTP POST Request:** As noted, both `$_POST` and `$_GET` are vulnerable.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:**  The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated or have any prior access to the application, meaning it can be exploited by anyone who can access the vulnerable URL.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Module:** The attacker needs to know that this specific module is installed on a target PrestaShop site and how to construct a SQL injection payload.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** PrestaShop versions 1.5.5.0 through 1.7.2.5 are vulnerable.
*  **Vulnerable Module:** The vulnerable module is identified as `Responsive Mega Menu (Horizontal+Vertical+Dropdown) Pro` version 1.0.32.
*   **Proof of Concept:** A specific proof of concept (PoC) is provided, showing how to retrieve table names using the `code` parameter with the value: `p(Db::getInstance()->ExecuteS("SHOW TABLES"));`.
*   **Solution:** The suggested solution involves disabling certain PHP functions (`exec()`, `passthru()`, `shell_exec()`, `system()`) or modifying the vulnerable file. This might prevent the attacker from executing code through SQLi but might not fix SQLi vulnerability.
