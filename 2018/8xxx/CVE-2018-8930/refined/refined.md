    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Simple programming flaws, unclear security boundaries, and insufficient security testing in the AMD Platform Security Processor (PSP) and chipset.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Bypassing PSP signature checks (MASTERKEY)",
        "Exploiting PSP APIs to gain code execution in the PSP or SMM (FALLOUT, RYZENFALL)",
        "Abusing exposed interfaces of the AMD Promontory chipset (CHIMERA)"
      ],
      "impact": "Code execution in the PSP and SMM, persistence across OS reinstallation and BIOS updates, ability to block or infect further BIOS updates, bricking the device, bypassing Windows Credential Guard, bypassing Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV), bypassing Secure Boot, attacking security features implemented on top of the PSP (e.g., fTPM).",
      "attack_vectors": "Exploitation through execution of malicious code with administrative privileges, potentially through BIOS updates or malicious drivers.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Requires the ability to run an executable as admin (no physical access required); MASTERKEY additionally requires issuing a BIOS update + reboot"

    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Vulnerabilities in the firmware managing the embedded security control processor (AMD Secure Processor) and the chipset used in some socket AM4 and socket TR4 desktop platforms.",

        "MASTERKEY and PSP Privilege Escalation: Failure of the AMD Secure Processor (PSP) to detect corrupted flash contents after an update.",
        "RYZENFALL and FALLOUT: Exploitable vulnerabilities in the interface between x86 and the AMD Secure Processor (PSP) when writing to specific registers.",
        "CHIMERA: Vulnerabilities in the Promontory chipset, where malicious drivers can expose certain chipset functions."
      ],
      "impact": "Circumvention of platform security controls, potential for persistent changes even after a system reboot, installation of difficult-to-detect malware in the SMM or chipset, access to physical memory through the chipset.",
      "attack_vectors": "Requires administrative access to the system for all exploits; specific attack methods include updating flash with corrupted content, writing to vulnerable PSP registers, and installing malicious drivers.",
