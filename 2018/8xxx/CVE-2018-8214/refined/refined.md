{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Incomplete fix for CVE-2018-0880 (MSRC case 42755). The fix secured the Cache directory but didn't address similar issues with the User.dat and UserClasses.dat files in the Helium directory.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The virtual registry for desktop bridge applications allows creation of arbitrary files as system due to insecure handling of registry cache files. Specifically, the Helium directory, which contains User.dat and UserClasses.dat, can be manipulated to create symbolic links that redirect to sensitive locations, allowing arbitrary file creation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Elevation of Privilege (EoP). By manipulating the virtual registry, an attacker can create arbitrary files in system-protected locations like system32, gaining elevated privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local. The attacker needs to be able to execute code within the context of a desktop bridge application.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to execute code within a desktop bridge application. They need to be able to rename the Helium folder and recreate it as a mount point with symbolic links."
