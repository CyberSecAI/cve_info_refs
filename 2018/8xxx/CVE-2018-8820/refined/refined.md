Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-8820:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  The vulnerability exists in the `match` parameter within the `/frevvo/web/tn/d/users?match=` path of Square 9 GlobalForms.
- The application does not properly sanitize or validate user input in the `match` parameter before using it in a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  An attacker can use the SQL injection vulnerability to exfiltrate sensitive information from the MSSQL database used by GlobalForms.
- In the tested cases, the MSSQL database was running with SYSTEM privileges, which allowed the attacker to leverage xp_cmdshell to establish an interactive shell on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote and requires authentication.
- The vulnerable parameter is accessible over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the Square 9 GlobalForms application.
- Default credentials for GlobalForms are mentioned (Username: admin, Password: admin@d), which, if not changed, could allow an attacker to gain initial access.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Square 9 GlobalForms versions 6.2.x and possibly other versions.
- A proof-of-concept exploit is available on GitHub.
