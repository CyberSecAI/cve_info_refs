**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution with root privileges may be possible.
- An attacker can compromise the VGo robot by injecting malicious commands.
- Based on CVSS score the impact is high for Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker on an adjacent network can exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable VGo Robot.
- No special privileges are needed, indicating a low skill level is required for exploitation.
