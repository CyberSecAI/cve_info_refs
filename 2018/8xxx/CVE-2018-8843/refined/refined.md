Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-8843:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a use-after-free error. It occurs when the Arena Simulation Software processes specially crafted files, leading to an attempt to access memory that has already been freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use After Free (CWE-416):** The core vulnerability is a use-after-free condition. This arises when the software tries to use a pointer to memory that has been deallocated, leading to unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Software Crash:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can cause the Arena software to crash.
- **Data Loss:** A crash can potentially lead to the loss of any unsaved data in the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted Files:** The attack vector involves using specially crafted Arena Simulation Software files. These files trigger the use-after-free vulnerability when processed by the software.
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely. The attacker requires access to the system in order to open or import the crafted malicious files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker would need local access to a system running a vulnerable version of Arena software.
- **User Interaction:** The user must open or import the maliciously crafted file for the vulnerability to be triggered.
- **Technical Skill:** High skill level is needed to craft the malicious file needed to trigger the vulnerability.
