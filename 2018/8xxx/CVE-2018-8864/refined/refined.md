- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing encryption of sensitive data in radio transmissions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Sensitive data transmitted via radio is not encrypted.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trigger false alarms by sending specially crafted malicious radio transmissions.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote exploitation via radio transmissions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attacker needs to be within radio range and have the technical expertise to craft malicious radio transmissions. High skill level is needed to exploit.
