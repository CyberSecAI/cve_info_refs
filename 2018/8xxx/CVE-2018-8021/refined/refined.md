Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-8021:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of the `pickle` library's unsafe `load` method to deserialize data when importing dashboards in Apache Superset versions prior to 0.23.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The core issue is the unsafe deserialization of untrusted data using Python's `pickle` library. `pickle.load()` can be exploited by specially crafted pickle files to execute arbitrary code.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application doesn't properly validate or sanitize the imported dashboard files, allowing a malicious pickle file to be processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable Apache Superset instance.
- **Full System Compromise:** RCE can lead to complete control over the server, enabling attackers to steal data, install malware, or pivot to other systems in the network.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability Impact:** The exploit can lead to high impact across confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Importing Malicious Dashboard:** An attacker crafts a malicious pickle file containing a payload for arbitrary code execution. This file is then uploaded using the import dashboard functionality, thus triggering the deserialization vulnerability.
- **Network-based attack:** The attacker can be remote and need not have prior access to the system, other than having network connectivity to the target.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Superset instance.
- **'can Import Dashboards' Privilege:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials for a user account that has the "can import dashboards" permission within Superset to be able to upload a crafted pickle file.
- **Craft Malicious Pickle File:** The attacker must have the skill to create a specially crafted pickle file containing the malicious payload.
- **No User Interaction Required:** The exploitation does not require any specific user interaction other than uploading a crafted file.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by switching to JSON for imports and exports instead of pickle.
- The identified exploit is a weaponized exploit for this CVE.
- The patch was initially done in a pull request but was reverted due to other issues, and later applied again.
- The GitHub Advisory database entry for this CVE includes a CVSS v4 score of 9.3, with high impacts on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- The EPSS score is 86.491%, indicating a high probability of exploitation.
