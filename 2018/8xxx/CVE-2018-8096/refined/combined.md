Seq is a log server that runs on a central machine. The applications send structured events through a framework and the platform organize them in dashboards. This is an application used by most of the world’s biggest companies, such as **Microsoft**, **Bosch**, **Allianz** and **Deloitte**.

Researching the platform (version 4.1.17.0), I’ve found a Broken Authentication (<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A2-Broken_Authentication>). This flaw allows a malicious user to assume other users’ identities temporarily or permanently. In my case, I managed to assume an admin identity.

Let me explain how I found it.

First I entered the application’s URL and got the login page:

![]()

Then, I tryed the “/api/” path and got some other paths:

![]()

So I decided to take a look at the path “api/users/”, unfortunately got nothing but denial:

![]()

With my hopes fading away, I decided to take a look at the HTTP requests and found an interesting path (**api/settings/setting-isauthenticationenabled**) with some JSON in the response body:

![]()

Reading carefully, I saw this “Value” key set as true. So I copied the entire JSON to the request body, changing the “Value” to false and the request method to PUT and sent it:

![]()![]()

As my modified request returned a 200 response, my hopes started to rise again. To see if it had really worked, I went back to the path “api/users”:

![]()

As shown in the image above, I got access to all this information about the application’s users, including the admin’s. But that wasn’t enough.

So I went back to the root URL and there I was, logged in the application as **admin** without typing any credentials and with access of many sensitive information. Yes, the authentication got disabled by my modified PUT request.

![]()

After a while, I decided to make an exploit to this vuln, for fun and studies’ purpose. So, if you wanna take a look, here it is: <https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45136/>

## Description

[![@nblumhardt](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/342712?v=4&size=48)](/nblumhardt)[nblumhardt](https://github.com/nblumhardt)opened [on Mar 12, 2018](https://github.com/datalust/seq-tickets/issues/675#issue-304558393)

A critical issue has been reported affecting versions of Seq up to and including 4.2.476. This application logic error permits a user with access to the HTTP API gain full access to the Seq server.

Seq servers with authentication enabled need to be upgraded to the latest Seq release available at <https://getseq.net/download>. Customers without active support/maintenance should contact support@getseq.net for information regarding a down-level patch.

### Timeline

1. On February 6th 2018 we were notified privately of the existence of the bug
2. We immediately verified the issue and evaluated options for mitigation; having determined that a low-risk fix was possible, we commenced work on a new version to resolve the issue
3. Within 24 hours of the report we emailed customers and active trial users with information about the bug and availability of the fixed release; we also produced and included a down-level patch for customers running unsupported/legacy versions
4. To allow for upgrades to take place, a minimum 30-day window was provided before raising this publicly-visible report

*In the interests of our customers, Datalust will not confirm or disclose security issues until an investigation has been completed and patches or mitigations are available.*

### Details

Authentication and authorization are separate in the v4.2 Seq security model. Unauthenticated requests are allowed access to various assets required for correctly displaying the `#/login` page; further authorization is bypassed when allowed unauthenticated requests are processed.

Among these assets are a group of four system settings including authentication options and some details of the authentication provider.

A missing check for the HTTP `PUT` method inadvertently enabled write access to these settings, through which the authentication provider can be modified or disabled.

### Impact

By disabling authentication, an attacker may gain admin access to the Seq web application. Through the plug-in "app" mechanism, this can be used to execute code on the Seq server with the capabilities/access level of the `Seq.exe` process.

The bug cannot be used to read user passwords, which for basic authentication are stored by Seq as salted PBKDF2 hashes.

The bug is not exploitable through a port locked down as ingestion-only, i.e. using the `api.ingestionPort` configuration setting.

### Patch availability

The bug is fixed in Seq versions 4.2.605 onwards. All users with a supported Seq license relying on authentication should update immediately to the most recent Seq 4.2 version (version [4.2.822](https://getseq.net/download) at the time of writing.

Users without current support/maintenance can access a patch for earlier versions by contacting support@getseq.net.

### Postmortem

We have identified two main factors that enabled this bug to remain undetected:

* Programmatic security configuration: the endpoints in question do appear to perform correct security checks, however because the responsibility for implementing this was spread between several unrelated blocks of code, the override was not obvious to inspection
* A test blindspot covering code added very early in product development: the settings mechanism was added very early in product development, at a time when integration test coverage was low; as testing has matured along with the rest of the product, some older code remained with low test coverage

As a result, a new, declarative security model has been implemented for Seq 5.0. This provides a basis for more precise test coverage, and also produces auditable documentation directly from the API security configuration.

We have also undertaken a further review of Seq 4.2. Additional test coverage has been added, and in versions from 4.2.717 onwards we took the additional step of centralizing a public URL/method white-list to improve auditability and reduce the likelihood of re-introducing this kind of issue in later code changes.

We're sorry for any inconvenience caused by this bug and would like to reiterate our commitment to producing the most secure Seq possible, and our dedication to handling security issues in a responsible and timely manner. Customers with questions or concerns may contact support@getseq.net for assistance.

Datalust is grateful to Daniel Chactoura of STOLabs for identifying and privately disclosing this issue.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

![Seq](/img/seq-logo-light.svg)

## The self-hosted search, analysis, and alerting server built for structured logs and traces.

### Developers in some of the world's smartestcompanies rely on Seq

![Coca-Cola](/img/logo/logo-1.svg)
![Microchip](/img/logo/logo-6.svg)
![Amazon](/img/logo/logo-7.svg)
![NASA](/img/logo/logo-2.svg)
![OctopusDeploy](/img/logo/logo-5.svg)
![ABB](/img/logo/logo-4.svg)

### Why structured logs?

Structured logs are the observability pillar that uniquely models your apps and services. They capture
the detailed, domain-specific events you need to debug tough problems, and they're perfect for
monitoring and analyzing system behavior in real time.

![](img/testimonial-headshot.png)Seq has already solved several visibility problems

— Arri Rucker

Seq is built from the ground up for modern structured logging. Events are captured as fully-structured JSON data,
and Seq's query language makes it natural to search and manipulate them without awkward parsing or format handling.

Seq accepts logs via [HTTP](https://docs.datalust.co/docs/posting-raw-events), [OpenTelemetry/OTLP](https://docs.datalust.co/docs/ingestion-with-opentelemetry),
[custom inputs](https://docs.datalust.co/docs/writing-custom-inputs), and
the [`seqcli` command-line client](https://github.com/datalust/seqcli), with plug-ins or integrations
available for .NET, Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, Docker, message queues, and many other technologies.

### Search and filter

Seq is a centralized log file with superpowers.

![Seq Log Search Screenshot](/img/home/seq-log-search-feature-1110w.gif)

Intuitive expression-based filtering, combined with free-text and regular expression searches, mean you can drill down into
events quickly, using techniques you already know.

### Analyze and chart

Go deeper with SQL-style log analysis and time-slicing to find trends and create beautiful charts and dashboards.

![Seq Dashboard Screenshot](/img/home/dashboards-feature.png)

Watch error rates, track latencies, or visualize business performance using structured data from your application log events.

### Trace and observe new

Get instant visibility into what complex operations are really doing.

![Seq Tracing Screenshot](/img/home/traces-feature.png)

Find the answer to questions such as *"Why is this endpoint slow?"* and *"What other services does this one call?"*.

### Alert and integrate

Be in-the-know about problems before your users or customers are affected.

![Seq Apps Screenshot](/img/home/apps-feature.png)

Set alerts based on custom conditions, and send notifications to a variety of channels including Slack, Teams, and SMTP mail.

Write custom integrations using a simple C# library, or as command-line apps in any programming language.
