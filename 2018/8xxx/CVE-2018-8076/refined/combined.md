### [VS-2018-016] ZenMate VPN for MacOS Type Confusion Vulnerability
#### CVE ID
CVE-2018-8076
#### CVSS Score
#### Vendor
ZenGuard GmbH
#### Product
ZenMate VPN for MacOS
#### Product Version
1.5.4
#### Vulnerability Details
ZenMate VPN for macOS suffers from a type confusion vulnerability within the `com.zenmate.chron-xpc` LaunchDaemon component. The LaunchDaemon implements an XPC service that uses an insecure XPC API for accessing data from an inbound XPC message. This could potentially result in an XPC object of the wrong type being passed as the first argument to the `xpc\_connection\_create\_from\_endpoint` function if controlled by an attacker. In recent versions of macOS and OS X, Apple has implemented an internal check to prevent such XPC API abuse from occurring, thus making this vulnerability only result in a denial of service if exploited by an attacker.
#### Vendor Response
ZenMate VPN will release an update.
