```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The DfMarshal custom unmarshaler for Storage objects is unsafe due to a lack of proper checks and validations when handling shared memory sections between processes. Specifically, it does not sufficiently verify the source of the shared memory, allowing a malicious process to manipulate the marshaled data and the shared memory region used during unmarshaling. This allows a lower privileged process to elevate privileges by controlling the unmarshaling process of a higher privileged service.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  -  Lack of proper session checks: The initial session check can be bypassed by sharing a writable section handle from a different session.
   - Lack of caller PID verification: The unmarshaler doesn't verify the caller PID through COM, allowing it to be tricked into using a shared memory region from a malicious process.
   - Unsafe shared memory handling: The code treats shared memory as if it were local and does not have proper safety precautions for dealing with untrusted data.
    - Missing bounds checking during unmarshaling
   -  Lack of validation of the data in the shared memory
   -TOCTOU issue with handle duplication.
- Impact of exploitation: Privilege escalation, allowing a local attacker to execute code with the privileges of a system service or other high-privilege process. This is due to the ability to control the shared memory section used by the unmarshaler, leading to arbitrary code execution in the target process' context.
- Attack vectors:
  - Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability.
  - An attacker needs to create a specially crafted Storage object that is then marshaled and unmarshaled by a target service.
  - An attacker needs to share a writable memory region with the target process. This can be done by abusing a service such as the Audio Service.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - The attacker must have local access to the system.
   -The attacker needs to be able to create a storage object that will be marshaled to a vulnerable service.
   -The attacker needs to find a way to create a shared memory section between the attacker process and a privileged service, such as by using the Audio Service (AUDIODG).
  - The attacker needs to be able to get the target service to unmarshal the malicious object.
