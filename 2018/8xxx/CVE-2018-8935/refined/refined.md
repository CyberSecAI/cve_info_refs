Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability Overview**

The vulnerabilities affect the AMD Secure Processor (PSP) firmware and the "Promontory" chipset used in some AMD platforms. They are not related to the "Zen" CPU architecture.

**1. MASTERKEY (PSP Privilege Escalation)**

*   **Root Cause:**  The AMD Secure Processor (PSP) firmware signature checks can be bypassed, allowing an attacker to update the PSP firmware with malicious code.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient validation of firmware updates to the PSP.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can circumvent platform security controls and maintain persistence across system reboots.
*   **Attack Vector:** Requires administrative access to the system to perform a BIOS update.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to run an executable as admin, ability to create a malicious firmware, and initiate a BIOS update.

**2. RYZENFALL and FALLOUT (PSP Firmware Exploits)**

*   **Root Cause:** Vulnerabilities in the interface between the x86 processor and the AMD Secure Processor (PSP), allowing attackers to write to specific PSP registers.
*   **Weakness:** Vulnerabilities in the PSP API.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can circumvent platform security controls, and can install difficult-to-detect malware in System Management Mode (SMM). The changes are not persistent across reboots.
*   **Attack Vector:** Requires administrative access to the system.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to run an executable as admin and the knowledge on how to write to specific PSP registers.

**3. CHIMERA ("Promontory" Chipset)**

*   **Root Cause:** Exposed functions in the "Promontory" chipset can be abused by an attacker via a malicious driver.
*   **Weakness:** Unsecured access to the chipset functions.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can access physical memory through the chipset and install difficult-to-detect malware in the chipset. The changes are not persistent across reboots.
*   **Attack Vector:** Requires administrative access to the system to install a malicious driver.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to run an executable as admin, and the ability to install a malicious driver to interact with the chipset.

**General Points**

*   **Administrative Access:** All the identified vulnerabilities require administrative access to the system, which is a significant prerequisite. Modern operating systems have security controls to prevent unauthorized administrative access, such as Windows Credential Guard.
*   **Persistence:** The MASTERKEY vulnerability allows for persistent changes (even after reboot), while RYZENFALL, FALLOUT, and CHIMERA do not.
*   **Complexity:** The attacks are not trivial, requiring significant development effort from an attacker.

**Mitigation**
* AMD is planning to release firmware patches through BIOS updates to address all vulnerabilities.

**Additional points from Trail of Bits:**
* The vulnerabilities allow for code execution in the PSP and SMM, areas where typical security products have no visibility.
* Exploitation can bypass Windows Credential Guard, Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV), Secure Boot and other security features based on the PSP, like fTPM.
