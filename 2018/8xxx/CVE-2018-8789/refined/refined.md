Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-8789:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies within the NTLM authentication module of FreeRDP. Specifically, there are multiple out-of-bounds read operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The NTLM authentication module attempts to read data beyond the boundaries of allocated buffers. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and crashes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a denial-of-service condition. The out-of-bounds reads cause the FreeRDP client to crash (segfault), disrupting its normal operation.
- Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution: While not explicitly stated in the provided documents, some sources note the possibility of arbitrary code execution. Although the main identified impact is a denial of service, the possibility of using memory corruption for code execution cannot be discarded.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious RDP Server: A malicious or compromised RDP server can trigger the vulnerability when a client connects to it using FreeRDP. The server sends specifically crafted NTLM messages designed to trigger the out-of-bounds reads during authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in control of an RDP server that a vulnerable FreeRDP client connects to. This means that the attacker does not need to have prior access to the client machine.
- No user interaction or privileges are required.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Eyal Itkin from Check Point Research.
- The vulnerability was fixed in FreeRDP version 2.0.0-rc4.
- The vulnerability is present in the NTLM authentication module.

The provided content does contain more details than the official CVE description, such as the specific location of the vulnerability within the NTLM authentication module and the fact that it can cause a segfault.
