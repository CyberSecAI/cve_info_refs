Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities, focusing on the MASTERKEY vulnerability as described in the text:

**Vulnerability:** MASTERKEY (related to AMD Secure Processor or "PSP" firmware)

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that the AMD Secure Processor (PSP) firmware checks do not detect corruption when an attacker updates the flash memory with malicious content. This implies a bypass of signature checks during the firmware update process.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Bypassed Signature Checks:** The core weakness is that the cryptographic signature checks meant to verify the authenticity and integrity of PSP firmware updates are bypassed. This allows the attacker to install arbitrary firmware onto the PSP.
    *   **Lack of Corruption Detection:** The PSP does not properly detect if the flash memory has been altered with malicious code.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Circumvention of Security Controls:** An attacker can bypass platform security controls by loading their own firmware onto the PSP. This gives the attacker a foothold at a very low level within the system.
    *   **Persistence:** The malicious changes are persistent even after a system reboot. This allows the attacker to maintain control over the system, even across reboots and OS reinstalls.
    *   **Potential for Further Attacks:** With code execution in the PSP, an attacker can block or infect further BIOS updates, brick the device, bypass Windows Credential Guard, bypass Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV), bypass Secure Boot, and attack security features implemented on top of the PSP.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malicious BIOS update:** The attacker requires administrative access to the system in order to initiate the malicious BIOS update, which includes the malicious PSP firmware.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Administrative Access:** The attacker must be able to run an executable with administrator privileges on the target system.
    *   **Ability to issue a BIOS update:**  The attacker needs to be able to perform a BIOS update.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content mentions that physical access is not required, implying that this can be done remotely or through software-based attacks.
*   The blog post also discusses related vulnerabilities like RYZENFALL, FALLOUT and CHIMERA but does not provide the necessary technical information to analyze them in-depth.

The provided blog post and the AMD statement are consistent in describing the MASTERKEY vulnerability as a way to bypass PSP firmware signature checks.
