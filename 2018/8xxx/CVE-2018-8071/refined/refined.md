**Verification:**

The content from `github.com_84008d54_20250126_091307.html` explicitly mentions "CVE-2018-8071" and links it to a stored XSS vulnerability in Mautic, which aligns with the CVE description. Other files provide contextual information related to the vulnerability.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled data within the theme configuration file of Mautic. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code that is later executed in the context of other users' browsers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability allows for the storage of malicious scripts within the theme configuration.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-provided data before storing it in the theme configuration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they access the Mautic application.
- **Session Hijacking:**  The malicious script could steal cookies or other sensitive information, potentially leading to session hijacking or account compromise.
- **Defacement:** The attacker could alter the appearance or content of the application as seen by the user.
- **Data Theft:** The script could be used to steal sensitive user data accessible by Mautic.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Theme Configuration File Modification:** An attacker can inject malicious script in the theme configuration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Mautic Access:** The attacker needs to have access to a Mautic instance, where they can upload/modify the theme config file. This may require administrative or developer privileges, depending on the system and configuration of Mautic.
- **Knowledge of Theme File Location:** The attacker must know where to insert the malicious code within the theme configuration file.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was reported by @joanbono with Accentureâ€™s Prague TVM Team.
