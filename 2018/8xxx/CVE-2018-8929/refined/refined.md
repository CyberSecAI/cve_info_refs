- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper restriction of communication channel to intended endpoints in the HTTP daemon of Synology SSL VPN Client.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is related to the lack of proper restrictions on the communication channel, allowing unauthorized endpoints to interact. This allows for a man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information (confidentiality), modification of data in transit (integrity) and potentially denial of service (availability).
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted payloads.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be positioned such that they can intercept network traffic between the client and the intended server. This requires the attacker to be on the same network segment as the client or able to intercept traffic. The attacker does not need any prior authentication or privileges (PR:N) to carry out the attack.
