Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-8955:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Bitdefender GravityZone installer uses a filename that includes a Base64-encoded URL pointing to an XML file. This XML file dictates the download locations of subsequent installation files. The installer blindly trusts the information within this XML file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The installer doesn't validate the URL provided in the filename or the XML content it fetches. This allows an attacker to replace the original, legitimate URL with one under their control.
*   **Unverified XML Parsing:** The installer parses the downloaded XML file without proper verification, which allows for manipulation of the download URLs and the final command to be executed.
*   **Blind Trust in Downloaded Files:**  The installer downloads and executes files based on the instructions in the manipulated XML, trusting both the provided URLs and MD5 hashes without further checks.
*   **Dependency on External Resources:** The installer relies on external resources (XML files) downloaded over HTTP, which can be easily intercepted or tampered with.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can cause the signed installer to execute arbitrary code from a remotely hosted executable by manipulating the XML file content.
*   **Silent Malware Installation:** An attacker can introduce extra malicious files/DLLs into the installation process along with legitimate files, allowing for a silent and stealthy malware installation.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Filename Manipulation:**  The attacker modifies the Base64-encoded URL within the installer's filename to point to a malicious server.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** Although not explicitly stated, this vulnerability could be exploited via a MitM attack, redirecting the legitimate XML download to a malicious server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Control Network Traffic:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept the installer's network traffic or host a server accessible by the installer during the download phase.
*   **Basic Understanding of Base64:** The attacker needs the ability to modify the Base64 encoded URL to point to their malicious XML file.
*   **Ability to host a malicious XML and executable file** The attacker needs to host the malicious XML and the malicious executable that will be downloaded and executed by the vulnerable installer.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability allowed an attacker to execute code without breaking the original digital signature of the installer.
*   The vulnerability is triggered through the setupdownloader executable.
*   Bitdefender addressed the vulnerability by releasing patched installers and revoking the affected certificates.
* The attack can be achieved through HTTP, although HTTPS can be bypassed.
