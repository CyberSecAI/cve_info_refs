- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Processing specially crafted .pm3 files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write, specifically writing outside the intended buffer area.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploiting the software by processing specially crafted .pm3 files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to provide the crafted .pm3 file to the affected software. The vulnerability is exploitable remotely and requires low skill to exploit. The user needs to be tricked to open a malicious file.
