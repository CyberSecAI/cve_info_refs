- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Address Book Editor of Synology CardDAV Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The Address Book Editor does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when processing the `family_name`, `given_name`, or `additional_name` parameters. This allows an attacker to inject malicious web scripts or HTML.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML in the context of the user's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or other attacks against the user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the Address Book Editor in Synology CardDAV Server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a remote authenticated user of the Synology CardDAV Server. The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the address book parameters mentioned and cause a victim to trigger the vulnerability.
