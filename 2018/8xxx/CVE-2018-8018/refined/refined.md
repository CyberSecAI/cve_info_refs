{
  "CVE-2018-8018": {
    "Description": "Apache Ignite through version 2.5's serialization mechanism does not have a list of classes allowed for serialization/deserialization, which makes it possible to run arbitrary code when 3-rd party vulnerable classes are present in Ignite classpath. The vulnerability can be exploited if the one sends a specially prepared form of a serialized object to GridClientJdkMarshaller deserialization endpoint.",
    "Root cause": "Improper deserialization of untrusted data due to lack of class allowlist.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure deserialization",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted serialized object to the GridClientJdkMarshaller deserialization endpoint.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to send network requests to the vulnerable endpoint with a malicious serialized object. Access to the classpath with vulnerable 3rd party dependencies."
  }
