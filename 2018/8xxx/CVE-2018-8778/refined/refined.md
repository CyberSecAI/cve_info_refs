{
  "CVE-2018-8778": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer under-read vulnerability exists in the Ruby String#unpack method.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The String#unpack method does not handle large numbers used with the `@` specifier correctly, treating them as negative values. This leads to an out-of-bounds read operation.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially read data from the heap memory if a script accepts an external input as an argument to String#unpack, leading to information disclosure.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by passing a large number with the `@` specifier to the String#unpack method.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs the ability to provide input to a script that uses String#unpack, with control over the format string argument."
  }
