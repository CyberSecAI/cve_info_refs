Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Improper restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) references in the handling of XEL files by Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- XML External Entity Injection (XXE). The application processes XML files and fails to properly sanitize external entities, which allows an attacker to include external resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose sensitive information within the context of the current process. This could potentially include local files, system information, and potentially network resources.
- Forced authentication and NTLM hash capture by including UNC paths for the external entities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The user must open a specially crafted .XEL file or visit a malicious page which contains this malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious .XEL file containing an XXE payload.
- The attacker must then get the target user to either open this malicious file or visit a webpage that triggers the vulnerable functionality.
- The attacker may need to set up a server to host a DTD file, receive information exfiltrated via the XXE, or receive authentication attempts.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability exists in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17.9 and SQL Server Management Studio 18.0 (Preview 4).
- The vulnerability was reported to Microsoft on 2018-06-07 and publicly disclosed on 2018-10-10.
- Microsoft has released a patch to address this vulnerability.
