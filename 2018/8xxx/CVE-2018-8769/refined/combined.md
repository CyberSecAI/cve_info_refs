| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=22976#c0)  probefuzzer    2018-03-16 14:33:39 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 10899](attachment.cgi?id=10899 "poc") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=10899&action=edit "poc") poc  On latest version (elfutils-0.170) and master branch of elfutils: there is a global-buffer-overflow in ebl_dynamic_tag_name function of (libebl/ebldynamictagname.c), which can be triggered by the POC below.   To reproduce the issue, compile elfutils with asan and run: ./bin/eu-readelf -a $POC  ==13884==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: global-buffer-overflow on address 0x0000006c18d0 at pc 0x00000048e6b4 bp 0x7fffffffc5c0 sp 0x7fffffffc5b8 READ of size 8 at 0x0000006c18d0 thread T0     #0 0x48e6b3 in ebl_dynamic_tag_name /u/xw48/GreedyFuzzing/product/elfutils/master-test/src/libebl/ebldynamictagname.c:59     #1 0x47602b in handle_dynamic /u/xw48/GreedyFuzzing/product/elfutils/master-test/src/src/readelf.c:1708     #2 0x47602b in print_dynamic /u/xw48/GreedyFuzzing/product/elfutils/master-test/src/src/readelf.c:1813     #3 0x47602b in process_elf_file /u/xw48/GreedyFuzzing/product/elfutils/master-test/src/src/readelf.c:911     #4 0x479fde in process_dwflmod /u/xw48/GreedyFuzzing/product/elfutils/master-test/src/src/readelf.c:707     #5 0x7fe8230dc22c in dwfl_getmodules /u/xw48/GreedyFuzzing/product/elfutils/master-test/src/libdwfl/dwfl_getmodules.c:86     #6 0x412568 in process_file /u/xw48/GreedyFuzzing/product/elfutils/master-test/src/src/readelf.c:806     #7 0x4059f3 in main /u/xw48/GreedyFuzzing/product/elfutils/master-test/src/src/readelf.c:322     #8 0x7fe8229b5c04 in __libc_start_main (/lib64/libc.so.6+0x21c04)     #9 0x406493  (/home/xw48/GreedyFuzzing/product/elfutils/master-test/exe_asan/bin/eu-readelf+0x406493) ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=22976#c1)  Mark Wielaard    2018-03-16 18:45:50 UTC  ``` Thanks. The issue is that there is a new standard SYMTAB_SHNDX which we got through the new elf.h, but didn't handle in ebldynamictagname.c.  To fix this, and to prevent this from happening in the future I proposed the following patch:  commit 92581d7eb483cb039e60112b0a03a04c2ffa4df4 Author: Mark Wielaard <mark@klomp.org> Date:   Fri Mar 16 19:42:17 2018 +0100      libebl: Handle SYMTAB_SHNDX in ebl_dynamic_tag_name.          SYMTAB_SHNDX was introduced when elf.h was imported, but not yet handled     in ebl_dynamic_tag_name. Handle it and add an eu_static_assert to make     sure stdtags always contains DT_NUM entries.

It was introduced by the import of elf.h by:   commit 88f3d2daa107b09fdba376a82bce7ed534c93645  Author: Mark Wielaard <mark@klomp.org>  Date:   Sat Feb 17 00:23:19 2018 +0100        libelf: Sync elf.h from glibc.            Signed-off-by: Mark Wielaard <mark@klomp.org>  This was done after 0.170 was released.  But that commit was backported into the Fedora elfutils package as part of the elfutils-0.170-elf_sync.patch to add some other non-related PowerPC improvements. ``` |  |
