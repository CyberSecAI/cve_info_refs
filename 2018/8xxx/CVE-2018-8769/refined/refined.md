- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a global-buffer-overflow in the `ebl_dynamic_tag_name` function within `libebl/ebldynamictagname.c`. This occurred because the code did not handle the new `SYMTAB_SHNDX` dynamic tag introduced in a newer version of `elf.h`. This resulted in an out-of-bounds read.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A global buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability allows for an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to a crash or information leak. The provided ASAN output confirms a read of size 8 at a specific memory address.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a crafted ELF file using `eu-readelf` tool of elfutils library.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted ELF file to a vulnerable version of the `eu-readelf` tool. The `poc` attachment in the bug report is an example of such a file. The attacker would need to be able to execute the `eu-readelf` binary.
