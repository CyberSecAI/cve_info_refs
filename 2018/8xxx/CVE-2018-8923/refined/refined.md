**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in the Attachment Preview feature of Synology File Station.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied data (specifically, attachment content) before displaying it within the web interface, allowing the injection of malicious scripts or HTML.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows a remote, authenticated attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML. This can potentially lead to various attacks, including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Phishing attacks
    - Stealing of sensitive information

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the File Station attachment preview functionality. An attacker uploads a file with malicious content. When a user previews the attachment, the injected code executes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be a remote, authenticated user of Synology File Station. They also need the ability to upload files that will be previewed by other users.
