Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-8860:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the cleartext transmission of sensitive information during firmware updates.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319). Firmware updates are transmitted without encryption.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker on an adjacent network can capture firmware updates. This could potentially allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information contained within the firmware.

**Attack vectors:** An attacker positioned on an adjacent network can monitor network traffic to intercept the unencrypted firmware updates.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable VGo Robot during firmware updates. No special privileges or user interaction are required.
