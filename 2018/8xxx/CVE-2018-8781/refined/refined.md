Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-8781:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The USB displaylink video adapter driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate `mmap` offsets received from userspace. Specifically, an integer overflow can occur when calculating the memory region to be mapped using the offset and length provided by the user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer Overflow: The driver lacks proper bounds checking when calculating the address range for memory mapping. Specifically, the calculation `offset + size` can wrap around if offset is large, bypassing the check `offset + size > info->fix.smem_len`
- Inadequate Input Validation: The driver doesn't properly validate the offsets provided by the userspace, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary memory ranges that should not be accessible.
- Lack of bounds checking for the initial offset: The driver does not check if offset is within the bounds of allowed memory region which is defined by `info->fix.smem_len`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Sensitive Information Exposure: A local attacker can use the vulnerability to expose sensitive information, such as kernel memory.
- Arbitrary Code Execution: An attacker might be able to use the vulnerability to achieve code execution in the kernel space, leading to privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Attack: The vulnerability can only be exploited by a local attacker.
- User-space application: The attack occurs through the use of mmap syscall from the user space on the targeted driver.
- Triggering the Vulnerability: The attacker triggers the vulnerability by using `mmap()` to map a memory region with crafted offset and length to exploit the integer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local Access: The attacker must have local access to the system.
- Driver Access: The attacker must have access to the vulnerable USB displaylink video adapter driver.
- Ability to use mmap() system call: The attacker must have the ability to invoke the mmap() system call with malicious parameters.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability resides in the `udl_fb_mmap()` function within the `drivers/gpu/drm/udl/udl_fb.c` file in the Linux kernel.
- It affects a range of Linux kernel versions from 3.4 to 4.15, according to bugzilla.redhat.com
- A patch was quickly developed and integrated into the Linux kernel, fixing the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability can lead to kernel-level code execution.
