- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `rtFilter` function of Microsoft VBScript. This function is called when the `Filter()` function is invoked to filter an array of strings based on a substring. The vulnerability arises because the input array can be resized during the `rtFilter` call by invoking a default getter on one of the array members. While `rtFilter` has some logic to detect resizing, it fails to handle cases where the input array contains elements that *do not match* the search string.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read. The `rtFilter` function accesses memory outside the bounds of the array when a resize occurs due to a default getter call on a non-matching element.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trigger an access violation and potentially cause a denial of service by forcing a crash of the VBScript engine.

- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious VBScript that calls the `Filter()` function with a specially crafted array containing objects with default getters that cause the array to resize when accessed, along with a search string that will not match certain array elements. This can be triggered in Internet Explorer.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to execute VBScript code within a vulnerable environment, such as a web page loaded in Internet Explorer. The attacker also needs to be able to craft a specific VBScript using the `Filter` function with an array that contains a combination of string and class object elements, along with a substring for filtering.
