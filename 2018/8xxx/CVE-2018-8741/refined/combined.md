| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1560341#c0)  Doran Moppert    2018-03-26 01:06:21 UTC  ```  This is an automatically created tracking bug!  It was created to ensure that one or more security vulnerabilities are fixed in affected versions of fedora-all.  For comments that are specific to the vulnerability please use bugs filed against the "Security Response" product referenced in the "Blocks" field.  For more information see: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/TrackingBugs>  When submitting as an update, use the fedpkg template provided in the next comment(s).  This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the fedpkg commit message.  NOTE: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. While only one tracking bug has been filed, please correct all affected versions at the same time.  If you need to fix the versions independent of each other, you may clone this bug as appropriate.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1560341#c1)  Doran Moppert    2018-03-26 01:06:26 UTC  ``` Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.  This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1557840,1560341  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [PUT CVEs HERE]  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======  Additionally, you may opt to use the bodhi web interface to submit updates:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1560341#c2)  Ben Cotton    2018-11-27 16:28:50 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 27 is nearing its end of life. On 2018-Nov-30  Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 27. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  'version' of '27'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 27 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1560341#c3)  Michal Hlavinka    2019-02-21 12:08:56 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1557842](show_bug.cgi?id=1557842 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2018-8741 SquirrelMail: Directory traversal flaw in Deliver.class.php can allow a remote attacker to retrieve or delete arbitrary files [fedora-all]") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1560341#c4)  Fedora Update System    2019-07-11 12:28:53 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2019-1a87523729 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 29. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2019-1a87523729>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1560341#c5)  Fedora Update System    2019-07-11 12:29:05 UTC  ``` FEDORA-EPEL-2019-aabd063c30 has been submitted as an update to Fedora EPEL 7. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-EPEL-2019-aabd063c30>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1560341#c6)  Fedora Update System    2019-07-12 02:15:54 UTC  ``` squirrelmail-1.4.23-1.fc30.20190710 has been pushed to the Fedora 30 testing repository.

# Squirrelmail Full Disclosure – TROOPERS18

Birk an me basically fully disclosed a 0day in [Squirrelmail](http://squirrelmail.org/) yesterday. This is a short Q&A to answer the most common questions about the issue to calm you all down a little bit. 😉

**What is the punchline, what do I need to know?**

An attacker able to exploit this vulnerability can extract files of the server the application is running on. This may include configuration files, log files and additionally all files that are readable for all users on the system. This issue is post-authentication. That means an attacker would need valid credentials for the application to log in or needs to exploit an additional vulnerability of which we are not aware of at this point of time.

An attacker would also be able to delete files on the system, if the user running the application has the rights to do so.

**Does this issue affect me?**

Likely yes, if you are using Squirrelmail. We checked the latest development version, which is 1.5.2-svn and the latest version available for download at this point of time, 1.4.22. Both contain the vulnerable code.

**What are the technical details for this vulnerability?**

There is an arbitrary read of files due to missing sanitization of user supplied input. An attacker can use a path traversal to reference arbitrary files from the target server getting attached to a mail. The parameter supplied by the attacker will be unserialized by the application and it contains the path to the temporary file that is supposed to be attached. The attacker fully controls that parameter and can set it to arbitrary values. One vulnerable code path ends up in the Deliver.class.php line 284:

 `284 $filename = $message->att_local_name;

285

[...]

294 $file_has_long_lines = file_has_long_lines($hashed_attachment_dir

295 . '/' . $filename, 990);

296

297 $file = fopen ($hashed_attachment_dir . '/' . $filename, 'rb');`

The reference to *$message->att\_local\_name* in line 284 is controlled by the attacker. The resulting call to *fopen* contains the attacker supplied path traversal, referencing an arbitrary file. The file will be attached to a mail and can be easily extracted by the attacker.

The file delete works in the same fashion.

**Why did you go full disclosure with this?**

We communicated this issue to Squirrelmail on 21.05.2017. We have since tried to reach out via additional mails and Twitter and have received no response. This is why we decided to fully disclose this issue. As this issue is post-authentication, we assume that the resulting damage from this full disclosure will likely be restricted. For more discussions on disclosures I would like to refer to [Another Perspective in Vulnerability Disclosure](https://insinuator.net/2016/01/another-perspective-in-vulnerability-disclosure/), [Sending Mixed Signals](https://insinuator.net/2015/09/sending-mixed-signals-what-can-happen-in-the-course-of-vulnerability-disclosure/) and [Reflections on Vulnerability Disclosure](https://insinuator.net/2015/07/reflections-on-vulnerability-disclosure/).

[November 27, 2024](https://insinuator.net/2024/11/vulnerability-disclosure-command-injection-in-kemp-loadmaster-load-balancer-cve-2024-7591/) by [Marius Walter](https://insinuator.net/author/mwalter/)
## [Vulnerability Disclosure: Command Injection in Kemp LoadMaster Load Balancer (CVE-2024-7591)](https://insinuator.net/2024/11/vulnerability-disclosure-command-injection-in-kemp-loadmaster-load-balancer-cve-2024-7591/)

While conducting security research, I identified a critical vulnerability in Kemp’s LoadMaster Load Balancer. This vulnerability is a [Command Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Command_Injection) and allows full system compromise. It requires no authentication and can be exploited remotely by having access to the Web User Interface (WUI). Kemp found that all LoadMaster versions up to and including version 7.2.60.0 and also the multi-tenant hypervisors up to and including version 7.1.35.11 are affected.

Kemp LoadMaster is a widely used Load Balancing Application that can commonly be seen in customer engagements. Therefore, we decided to take a closer look as part of our regular research projects.

As promised in the [Announcement: Progress / Kemp LoadMaster CVE-2024-7591](https://insinuator.net/2024/09/announcement-progress-kemp-loadmaster-cve-2024-7591/), I will go into detail about how I identified the vulnerability, where the vulnerable part of the code is, how the vulnerability can be exploited, and finally, how the vendor fixed this vulnerability.

During a penetration test for a customer, we briefly assessed [Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden), an open-source online password safe. In June 2024, the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) published results[1](#fn1) of a static and dynamic test of the Vaultwarden server component. Therefore, only a partial source code audit was performed during our assessment. However, a quick look was needed to find some glaring issues with the authentication.

## [Announcement: Progress / Kemp LoadMaster CVE-2024-7591](https://insinuator.net/2024/09/announcement-progress-kemp-loadmaster-cve-2024-7591/)

Hey everybody,

during a recent Red Teaming engagement Marius Walter from [ERNW](https://ernw.de/) found a command injection issue in Progress (Kemp) LoadMaster. It was registered as [CVE-2024-7591](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7591) and scores a CVSS of 10.0.

The vendor already has patches out, make sure to apply them as this is a high severe issue. You can find the official announcement and the patch references on the [official support page](https://support.kemptechnologies.com/hc/en-us/articles/29196371689613-LoadMaster-Security-Vulnerability-CVE-2024-7591).

Marius will follow up with a technical blog post on this issue once we think everybody had a realistic chance of applying the patches.

## [Disclosure: Apple ADE – Network Based Provisioning Bypass](https://insinuator.net/2024/08/disclosure-apple-ade-network-based-provisioning-bypass/)

Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions are used to centrally manage mobile devices in corporate environments. This includes the monitoring of the device, automatic installation/removal of apps or certificates and restrict the functionality. Even though MDM solutions exist for multiple vendors, we will look specifically on Apple devices enrolled via Intune. When an Apple device is registered for Automated Device Enrollment (ADE), it will automatically download and apply these policies during the initial setup and prior to the first boot.

During a customer project, we identified a network-based provisioning bypass which prevents the iPad to fetch and apply the provisioning profiles.

## [BMBF UNCOVER – Monitoring von Sicherheitsvorfällen in Fahrzeugen](https://insinuator.net/2024/06/bmbf-uncover-monitoring-von-sicherheitsvorfallen-in-fahrzeugen/)

#### English Abstract

For the realization and introduction of autonomous vehicles, the safe interaction of functions, systems and services as well as their monitoring over the entire product life cycle is essential. An exclusive security-by-design approach is no longer sufficient and must be continuously supported by feedback obtained from in-the-wild operation. This is where the recently successfully completed joint project BMBF UNCOVER comes into play, which targets the requirements of the standards *ISO/SAE 21434 (Road vehicles – Cybersecurity engineering)* and *ISO 21448 (Road vehicles – Safety of the intended functionality (SOTIF))*.

## [Security Advisory: Achieving PHP Code Execution in ILIAS eLearning LMS before v7.30/v8.11/v9.1](https://insinuator.net/2024/05/security-advisory-achieving-php-code-execution-in-ilias-elearning-lms-before-v7-30-v8-11-v9-1/)

During my Bachelor’s thesis, I identified several XSS vulnerabilities and a PHP Code Execution vulnerability via an insecure file upload in the learning management system (LMS) ILIAS. The XSS vulnerability can be chained with the code execution vulnerability so that attackers with tutor privileges in at least one course can perform this exploit chain.

[May 14, 2024](https://insinuator.net/2024/05/linux-character-devices-exploring-systemd-run-and-pkexec/) by [Tillmann Oßwald](https://insinuator.net/author/tosswald/)
## [Linux Character Devices: Exploring systemd-run and pkexec](https://insinuator.net/2024/05/linux-character-devices-exploring-systemd-run-and-pkexec/)

In this blog post, we quickly look into issues involving character devices. As is typical for Linux, everything is a file, so character devices are referenced as files, such as pseudo terminals (pts) under `/dev/pts/`. `man pty` briefly introduces the topic. Essentially, it is used to connect a program, such as a terminal emulator, to a shell. In the end, a pty can read and write like a regular file. A colleague already brought up the topic of ptys and character devices. But more recently a [Twitter post](https://twitter.com/hackerschoice/status/1787601814021361729) and the [accompanying advisory](https://github.com/hackerhouse-opensource/exploits/blob/master/systemd-run-tty.txt) piqued my interest.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

# Squirrelmail Full Disclosure – TROOPERS18

Birk an me basically fully disclosed a 0day in [Squirrelmail](http://squirrelmail.org/) yesterday. This is a short Q&A to answer the most common questions about the issue to calm you all down a little bit. 😉

**What is the punchline, what do I need to know?**

An attacker able to exploit this vulnerability can extract files of the server the application is running on. This may include configuration files, log files and additionally all files that are readable for all users on the system. This issue is post-authentication. That means an attacker would need valid credentials for the application to log in or needs to exploit an additional vulnerability of which we are not aware of at this point of time.

An attacker would also be able to delete files on the system, if the user running the application has the rights to do so.

**Does this issue affect me?**

Likely yes, if you are using Squirrelmail. We checked the latest development version, which is 1.5.2-svn and the latest version available for download at this point of time, 1.4.22. Both contain the vulnerable code.

**What are the technical details for this vulnerability?**

There is an arbitrary read of files due to missing sanitization of user supplied input. An attacker can use a path traversal to reference arbitrary files from the target server getting attached to a mail. The parameter supplied by the attacker will be unserialized by the application and it contains the path to the temporary file that is supposed to be attached. The attacker fully controls that parameter and can set it to arbitrary values. One vulnerable code path ends up in the Deliver.class.php line 284:

 `284 $filename = $message->att_local_name;

285

[...]

294 $file_has_long_lines = file_has_long_lines($hashed_attachment_dir

295 . '/' . $filename, 990);

296

297 $file = fopen ($hashed_attachment_dir . '/' . $filename, 'rb');`

The reference to *$message->att\_local\_name* in line 284 is controlled by the attacker. The resulting call to *fopen* contains the attacker supplied path traversal, referencing an arbitrary file. The file will be attached to a mail and can be easily extracted by the attacker.

The file delete works in the same fashion.

**Why did you go full disclosure with this?**

We communicated this issue to Squirrelmail on 21.05.2017. We have since tried to reach out via additional mails and Twitter and have received no response. This is why we decided to fully disclose this issue. As this issue is post-authentication, we assume that the resulting damage from this full disclosure will likely be restricted. For more discussions on disclosures I would like to refer to [Another Perspective in Vulnerability Disclosure](https://insinuator.net/2016/01/another-perspective-in-vulnerability-disclosure/), [Sending Mixed Signals](https://insinuator.net/2015/09/sending-mixed-signals-what-can-happen-in-the-course-of-vulnerability-disclosure/) and [Reflections on Vulnerability Disclosure](https://insinuator.net/2015/07/reflections-on-vulnerability-disclosure/).

Florian

Subject: Squirrelmail directory traversal vulnerability allows exfiltrating
 files from server

Hi,

During the Troopers conference this week an unpatched vulnerability in
squirrelmail was presented by Florian Grunow from ERNW [1].

The issue is that when uploading a mail attachment a temporary file is
generated on the server that the client later references when sending
the mail. The filename is not sanitized in any way, so by passing a
filename of the form "../../../../some_path/some_filename" one can use
this to attach arbitrary files from the server that can be accessed by
the PHP process to a mail. Thus an attacker who has a mail account
could use this to exfiltrate files and send them as attachments.

The bug is unfixed. The finders say they tried to reach out to the
squirrelmail developers, but were unable to contact them.

Squirrelmail hasn't had a release for many years and the webpage has
its last news from 2013. But despite that until recently the subversion
repository and the provided svn snapshots still provided security
fixes, e.g. a 2017 found injection vuln [2] was fixed.
Despite its stale state I believe many people still use squirrelmail,
in my experience it works better than alternatives like roundcube in
situations where you have very weak internet connections.

I created a preliminary quick and dirty patch that should close the
main hole [3]. It guarantees that the filename only contains letters
and numbers (this should be okay as the filename is created by
squirrelmail and usually doesn't contain any user-controlled
characters in normal operation) and otherwise just terminates the
process. There may be an obscure cornercase where this patch does not
fully protect: If for some reason a user can guess another users
temporary filename while writing a mail one may be able to exfiltrate
that. I find that unlikely enough that I haven't bothered looking more
into this.

The researchers found this flaw while investigating a check point
appliance that bundles squirrelmail for their webmail functionality. As
squirrelmail is GPL I asked check point to share the patch, which they
did and I'm providing it here [4]. I haven't reviewed it, but the ERNW
people told me it may not work with all PHP versions.

In any case if anyone has contact to the squirrelmail authors it would
be great if they could incorporate a fix (and maybe even provide a new
release). Otherwise everyone using squirrelmail should obviously
patch this manually.

Hash: SHA256

Package        : squirrelmail
Version        : 2:1.4.23~svn20120406-2+deb7u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-8741
Debian Bug     : 893202

Florian Grunow and Birk Kauer of ERNW discovered a path traversal
vulnerability in SquirrelMail, a webmail application, allowing an
authenticated remote attacker to retrieve or delete arbitrary files
via mail attachment.

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
2:1.4.23~svn20120406-2+deb7u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your squirrelmail packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1616084#c0)  Laura Pardo    2018-08-14 22:26:32 UTC  ```  This is an automatically created tracking bug!  It was created to ensure that one or more security vulnerabilities are fixed in affected versions of fedora-all.  For comments that are specific to the vulnerability please use bugs filed against the "Security Response" product referenced in the "Blocks" field.  For more information see: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/TrackingBugs>  When submitting as an update, use the fedpkg template provided in the next comment(s).  This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the fedpkg commit message.  NOTE: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. While only one tracking bug has been filed, please correct all affected versions at the same time.  If you need to fix the versions independent of each other, you may clone this bug as appropriate.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1616084#c1)  Laura Pardo    2018-08-14 22:26:36 UTC  ``` Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.  This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1611645,1616084  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [PUT CVEs HERE]  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======  Additionally, you may opt to use the bodhi web interface to submit updates:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1616084#c2)  Ben Cotton    2019-05-02 21:06:09 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 28 is nearing its end of life. On 2019-May-28 Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 28. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '28'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 28 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1616084#c3)  Fedora Update System    2019-07-11 12:28:52 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2019-1a87523729 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 29. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2019-1a87523729>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1616084#c4)  Fedora Update System    2019-07-11 12:29:04 UTC  ``` FEDORA-EPEL-2019-aabd063c30 has been submitted as an update to Fedora EPEL 7. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-EPEL-2019-aabd063c30>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1616084#c5)  Fedora Update System    2019-07-12 02:15:53 UTC  ``` squirrelmail-1.4.23-1.fc30.20190710 has been pushed to the Fedora 30 testing repository.

Why do they not post alll of squirrelmail's code on github and let people fork it, so others can maintain SquirrelMail the way it should, by communicating..

Sure [@dertuxmalwieder](https://github.com/dertuxmalwieder), I know github is not the only one, but you just can't deny the facts that it is by far the easiest one to use, and has a much larger user-base. Furthermore, my main complaint on the SM project as it stands is the total lack of communication. Looking at their website makes you think it's dead, while it isn't.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Github is not the only VCS platform which allows forks and contributions. There is rarely a good reason to change your VCS every few years just because a different one is "the thing" now.

[@hannob](https://github.com/hannob)

is it really a good idea to go straight to `die()`?

or cant it just say "skip this file"?

ctype\_alnum is the wrong thing to use here

That code will also prevent you from having files called something.tar.gz

[@BernhardPosselt](https://github.com/BernhardPosselt) are you sure? As far as I understand, `$message->att_local_name` contains a temporary file name generated by squirrelmail, not the actual name of the attachment.

Crashing at the first sign of trouble seems suboptimal.

You can't have problems with slashes in filenames if there were never slashes in any real filenames to begin with.

"It is NATO that is dangerously diverting our attention and resources to war, and away from the grave threat of global warming." Links to all resources are at the bottom of this post, and I will quote some essential parts and conclusions, to make you understand why I'm even posting this (explaining why blaming NATO is valid and appropriate). "While China and Russia have a limited military presence with 4 and 8 foreign land-bases respectively, the USA operates 87, the UK 17, and France 13 foreign bases. Based solely on the extent of land occupation, NATO has -by far- the largest negative ecological impact of any global conglomerate. This assessment does not account for the environmental damage caused by bomb strikes, where NATO has surpassed every other possible contender or corporation over the past 40 years. [...] In all this the impacts of production stages in the weapons manufacturing industry have not been included, but it needs to be stated that even when discounting those it is undeniable that without the existence of NATO we would not have a global warming problem today."

If you're managing linux servers (or desktops, even), I highly recommend this firewalling suite called CSF/LFD. Been using it for decades, and it has protected 'my' linux machines better than anything else ever could. Proud to say none of the systems I manage have been compromised, hacked, broken in to or ransomwared. CSF is easy to install and comprehend even for linux noobs, has well written documentation and does what you hope it does and usually better! It offers an integrated webserver user interface, or integrates in existing control panels (like webmin). And amazingly it's still completely free! https://configserver.com/configserver-security-and-firewall/ I have not been paid for this. It's just out of sheer appreciation and being thankful for all the hard work that its devs have put into it which made me decide to post this.

Population declines of Earth's species: 56% of mammals (32–75%) 53% of birds (48–56%) 63% of amphibians (43–75%) 54% of insects (13–89%) 41% of fishes (11–84%) 28% of reptiles (14–63%) 'the magnitude of the Anthropocene biodiversity crisis is considerably more severe than suggested by analyses based on IUCN Red List conservation categories.' The scientific consensus: economic growth and the race for profit mean extinction. 'the planet is approaching a mass extinction event far graver than prior research has suggested' https://phys.org/news/2023-05-anthropocene-sixth-mass-extinction-event.html The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) says '28% of species are under threat'. However, a third of species currently classified as non-threatened on the IUCN Red List 'are actually spiraling toward extinction'. https://www.euronews.com/green/2023/05/26/almost-half-worlds-species-seeing-rapid-population-decline-study-finds Scenario-based climate projections considering the most critical life stages (spawners and embryos) clearly identify the temperature requirements for reproduction as a critical bottleneck in the life cycle of fish. http://web.archive.org/web/20221206235031/https://amp.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/02/fish-species-survival-climate-warming-study 60% of primate species are threatened with extinction, 75% are declining.

Blijft leuk ;) Interessant om te vermelden was dat die 'storingen' niet uit de zelfbouw zender kwamen, maar dat ik heel dicht bij een Centraal Antenne Systeem, een voorloper van kabeltelevisie, woonde, en dat de signaal-versterkers die daar toen gebruikt werden niet waren opgewassen tegen sterke hoog-frequent straling (ongeacht de golflengte van die straling). Het was niet zo dat de 'harmonischen stoorden op de luchtvaart- en TV-banden', zoals toen \*altijd\* werd ge-opperd in de rechtzaal. Er zaten zgn band-pass filters aan de uitgang van mijn zender, daar konden evt harmonischen niet eens doorheen komen. Van de 18 Watt output van de eindtrap bleef nog maar 10 Watt over voor de antenne, zo sterk waren die filters. Iedereen die ooit met hoogfrequent zenders en ontvangers heeft gewerkt weet dat gevoelige antenne-versterkers (t.b.v. ontvangst van ver weg gelegen TV-zenders) niet tegen sterke HF-straling in de nabijheid kunnen, en al helemaal niet als een kabeltelevisie richt-antenne precies jouw kant op staat, terwijl jij met een FM-zender aan het stoeien bent..

Try not to be insulted by the headline. I wrote this because it is slowly becoming mainstream to be scared of 5G, which is - honestly - really stupid. Most people complaining about the bad effects of 5G, 4G, microwave, wireless internet etc. have not been enjoying any education in basic physics. I'll try and explain why in simple to understand language; "How can we be so sure that many diseases are not being caused by the radiation poisoning now occurring from cell phones, 5G towers, EMF’s in the home (wifi, microwave ovens, refrigerators, digital meters etc) at the office, on a ship (many now have onboard 5G), at a concert (with tens of thousands of cell phones in use in close proximity)?" We can be quite sure of that because the radiation you refer to can easily be measured. Both in strength and in frequencies used by these devices. Prior to the growth of cable-TV, digital radio, wireless internet, smartphones, 2/3/4/5G UMTS, the air around us was literally loaded with actual TV signals (VHF/UHF) and FM/AM radio transmissions everywhere. Really powerful ones, from local radio- and TV-stations all the way up to nationwide transmitters. Most of those transmitters pumped…

The President of Ukraine, from 2014 to 2019; Imagine we would have a president in the Netherlands, saying this about Frisian citizen, or about Jewish people, or about Muslims, or about atheists? He would be ousted within a day. So how come some of you still wonder why the ethnic Russian population of the Donbass wanted to become part of Russia again? Sham-elections my ass. Even many Western Ukrainians actually spoke up against the ridiculously fascist government, but they were never heard, it seems.. Just a reminder of what CIA director William Burns said in a leaked email, back in 2008 (courtesy WikiLeaks): He was right. Ethnic Russians in Ukraine became the victim of an enormous apartheidsregime, enforced by Kiev's government. Read more about the chain of events here. And this anti-minority regime is still active, currently they're enforcing Ukrainian men joining their chosen war against ethnic Russians (i.e. most of them have relatives there, so in fact no sane Ukrainian man actually wants this war). UN estimates the total number of conflict-related casualties in the Donbass region from 14 April 2014 to 31 December 2021 to be 51,000–54,000, of which 14,200-14,400 were killed, and of which ~9000 injured were…

Let's do a simple comparison everybody can understand: Population of USA: 338 million, imprisoned: 2100k = 0.62% in jail. Population of Russia: 144 million, imprisoned: 472k = 0.33% in jail. Population of China: 1425 million, imprisoned: 1690k = 0.0011% in jail. Even if this would imply that (for example) policing in both Russia or China is really bad, that there are bribes keeping people out of prison, that crime-rings are left untouched, that both Russia and China are deliberately keeping crime on the streets instead of in prison, or that Russia and China are torturing and threatening people instead of locking them up, or that Russia and China prefer letting criminals work for them under the threat of being imprisoned if they refuse to comply (i.e. a form of slavery). Even if all that were the case, there would still be no way you'd reach and equal to the amount of lawlessness or police-state or freedom-infringement taking place in the US of A. The difference is just way too large to make that come close. Noteworthy as well is that both Russia and China have extremely low documented crime numbers in general, compared to those in Western Europe and the…

For some strange reason, nobody ever reads or listens to what the president, the leader, of their (fictitious) enemy has to say about stuff. Below is a copy-paste from what Putin most recently had to say about the nuke threats, which, I would reckon, is of value to our survival on this planet, no? So by all means, read the important clip from the translation here; Mr President, could you please comment, is it true that the world is on the verge of the possible use of nuclear weapons? How will Russia act in these circumstances, given that it is a responsible nuclear state? Thank you. Vladimir Putin: Look, as long as nuclear weapons exist, there will always be a danger that they could be used. This is the first thing. Second, the goal of the current fuss around such threats and the potential use of nuclear weapons is very primitive, and I would probably be not mistaken when I explain what this is about; I already said that the dictate of the Western countries and their attempts to apply pressure on all the participants of international communication, including countries that are neutral or friendly to us, are achieving nothing,…

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
