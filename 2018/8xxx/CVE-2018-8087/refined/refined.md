Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-8087:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a memory leak in the `hwsim_new_radio_nl()` function within the Linux kernel's mac80211_hwsim driver, which is used for simulating 802.11 wireless devices.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory Leak: When handling certain error conditions during the creation of a simulated radio, the `hwsim_new_radio_nl()` function fails to free allocated memory for the `hwname`. This results in a memory leak every time the error occurs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: The memory leak can lead to memory exhaustion, which can cause a system crash or general instability, resulting in denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local Attack: The vulnerability can be triggered by a local attacker with the ability to interact with the mac80211_hwsim driver and create simulated wireless devices.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- The attacker needs to have the capability to interact with the mac80211_hwsim driver, which is typically done via network configuration or testing tools.

**Additional notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involves ensuring that the `hwname` is freed in the error handling paths of the `hwsim_new_radio_nl()` function.
- The vulnerability affects various Linux distributions, including Ubuntu and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, where it can lead to a denial of service.
- The patch for this issue has been applied to multiple kernel versions across different Linux distributions.
- The bug report from Red Hat ([https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1555145](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1555145)) provides further details on the specific code location and the fix applied.
- Ubuntu security notices (USN-3676-1, USN-3676-2, USN-3677-1, USN-3677-2, USN-3678-1, USN-3678-2, USN-3678-3, USN-3678-4) confirm the presence of this vulnerability and provide guidance for applying updates.
