Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-8619:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the VBScript execution policy in Internet Explorer 11 does not apply to VBScript code embedded within MSXML XSL files. This allows VBScript to execute even when it should be disabled according to the configured security zones, such as the Internet Zone or Restricted Sites Zone.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Execution Policy Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to circumvent the intended VBScript execution policy.
- **MSXML XSL Processing:**  The vulnerability specifically exists due to the way MSXML processes XSL files that contain embedded VBScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary VBScript code by crafting malicious XSL files.
- **Circumvention of Security Controls:**  The exploitation allows attackers to bypass the intended security restrictions that are meant to limit VBScript execution from the internet.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Server Delivery:** The exploit involves placing malicious XSL files on a web server in the Internet Zone.
- **User Interaction:** The user would need to open an HTML file that references or loads the malicious XSL file through Internet Explorer 11.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Web Server Access:** The attacker needs a web server accessible to the target user, which can be in the Internet zone.
- **Crafting Malicious XSL:** The attacker needs to create malicious XSL files containing embedded VBScript that they want to execute.
- **Social Engineering:** In some cases, social engineering might be required to lure a user into visiting the malicious web page.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit-db content references a proof of concept available at a given gitlab link.
- The content notes that this was tested on Windows 10 Version 1803 with the latest patches applied and VBScript execution policy applied for the Internet Zone. This detail shows that the vulnerability was present even with the latest security patches in place, highlighting the severity of the issue.
