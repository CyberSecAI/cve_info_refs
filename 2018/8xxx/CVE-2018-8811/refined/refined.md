Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-8811

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in the `user_role.jsp` file within the OpenCMS application. The application doesn't implement checks to ensure that requests modifying user roles originate from legitimate user actions, allowing an attacker to forge requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The primary vulnerability is the absence of CSRF tokens or other suitable countermeasures to prevent unauthorized state-changing requests. This allows an attacker to make requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to elevate the privileges of a low-privileged user to that of a Root Administrator. This is achieved by crafting a malicious request that, when submitted by a logged-in administrator, grants root-level access to the specified target user. This can lead to complete compromise of the CMS instance.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious HTML Form:** The attack vector is a crafted HTML form that is sent to a logged-in administrator user. The form is designed to submit a request to the vulnerable `user_role.jsp` endpoint.
- **Social Engineering:** An attacker would likely use social engineering tactics to trick a user with administrator privileges into opening a web page hosting this form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Target a Logged-in Administrator:** The attacker needs to target a user who is currently logged in to OpenCMS with administrative privileges.
- **Ability to Deliver Malicious Content:** The attacker must be able to deliver the crafted HTML content to the targeted administrator, which can be accomplished through methods such as malicious links sent via email or on websites.
- **Knowledge of Target User ID:** The attacker needs to know or be able to determine the user ID of the target account to be elevated. The exploit code includes `userid` parameter, which needs to be substituted with the ID of a low-privileged user.
