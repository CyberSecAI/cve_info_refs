Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-8069

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `webname` parameter within the `/backend/system.html` page of the Qcms version 3.0 application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `webname` parameter. Specifically, it doesn't prevent the injection of malicious HTML/JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through the `webname` parameter. This code is then executed in the context of the victim's browser when they access the `/index.php` page, which displays the `webname` setting.
- **Account Hijacking:** By executing malicious JavaScript, an attacker could steal session cookies, potentially leading to account hijacking.
- **Data Manipulation/Defacement:** An attacker could manipulate the content of the webpage or deface it.
- **Further Attacks:** The injected script could potentially be used to launch further attacks on the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** An attacker crafts a malicious POST request to the `/backend/system.html` endpoint, setting the `webname` parameter to the malicious XSS payload.
- **Victim Accessing `/index.php`:**  The injected script is triggered when a victim visits the `/index.php` page, which displays the unsanitized `webname` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be logged into the administrative panel to modify the `webname` parameter via `/backend/system.html`.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the XSS vulnerability in the `webname` parameter.
- **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker requires the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Payload Example:**
-  `<svg/onload=alert(0)>`

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content includes the HTTP request, showing how the payload is delivered to the server. It also shows the usage of the parameter using URL encoding (`%3Csvg%2Fonload%3Dalert%280%29%3`).
- The screenshots in the documentation demonstrate the injection process and the resulting alert dialog box.
- The vulnerability requires admin-level authentication.
