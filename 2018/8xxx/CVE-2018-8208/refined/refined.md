Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the way the `CreateAppContainerToken` API is used during the activation of Desktop Bridge applications. Specifically, the AppInfo service, running as Local System, does not impersonate the user when calling this API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Arbitrary Object Directory Creation:** Because the `CreateAppContainerToken` API doesn't impersonate the user, it creates AppContainer object directories as the process user. This allows an attacker to create arbitrary object directories by using symbolic links within these locations.
- **Race Condition:** While the system checks that the directories are under the AppContainerNamedObjects directory, the kernel object persistence allows a race condition to be exploited. By opening a directory before all handles are closed, an attacker can keep it alive.
- **Insecure DACL:** The created directories are given an explicit DACL (Discretionary Access Control List) granting access to the user, allowing them to write to the created directories.
- **Session 0 Directory Permissions:** The `AppContainerNamedObjects` directory in Session 0 has write permissions for Everyone. This allows a system process running as an AppContainer in Session 0 to create exploitable directories.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** By creating arbitrary object directories, an attacker can achieve EoP by manipulating the system into executing code or actions with elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Symbolic Links:** Attackers place symbolic links in specific locations to redirect the creation of object directories.
- **Race Condition Exploitation:**  The attacker must win a race condition to keep the created directory alive and interact with it.
- **Targeting Desktop Bridge Applications:** The vulnerability is triggered through the activation process of Desktop Bridge applications.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Access:** The attacker must have local user access to the system.
- **Ability to Create Symbolic Links:** The attacker must be able to create symbolic links within the system.
- **Multi-Core System (Recommended):** Exploitation is more reliable on multi-core systems due to the race condition involved.
- **Installed Desktop Bridge Application:** The attacker needs an installed Desktop Bridge application to trigger the vulnerable activation process.

**Additional Technical Details:**

- The exploit leverages the `CreateAppContainerToken` API not impersonating the user.
- The vulnerability exists in Windows 10 versions 1703 and 1709 (not tested on RS4).
- The proof-of-concept (PoC) uses the "My Office" application as an example. However, any installed Desktop Bridge application can be used with minor modifications.
