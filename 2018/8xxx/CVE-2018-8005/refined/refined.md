Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-8005:

**CVE Description:** The CVE description is a placeholder, however, the Debian Security Advisory DSA-4282-1 provides a description and states:

> Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Apache Traffic Server, a reverse and forward proxy server, which could result in denial of service, cache poisoning or information disclosure.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Apache Traffic Server handles multi-range requests. The core issue is that the server did not have a mechanism to limit the number of ranges in a request. This could lead to a resource exhaustion attack (denial of service).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of validation or limitation on the number of ranges in a multi-range request.
- Potential for excessive resource consumption when handling specially crafted multi-range requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could send a request with an extremely large number of ranges, causing the server to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory) and become unresponsive or crash.
- Potential for other unspecified negative impacts mentioned as cache poisoning or information disclosure as noted in the DSA.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker would send a crafted HTTP request to the Traffic Server with a `Range` header containing a large number of ranges. This could be done through a client directly communicating with the proxy or through a web application sending these requests through the proxy.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Traffic Server. This can be from any network position that has access to the Traffic Server.

**Additional details:**
-  Pull Request #3106 introduces a new configuration option `proxy.config.http.allow_multi_range`, which is used to control whether multi-range requests are allowed or not. This PR aimed to address a potential abuse with well-formed multi-range requests.
-  The default value of this new configuration was left enabled initially in PR #3106, but later, in PR #3124, the default was set to disabled in order to prevent potential abuse and the configuration was added to the 8.0.0 milestone. This also disabled the support by default on LTS branches without breaking backward compatibility, as it required explicit enabling.
-  Debian fixed this issue in version `7.0.0-6+deb9u2` of the `trafficserver` package.
