For more information about WhatsUp Gold supported SQL databases, see the release notes [Database requirements](index.htm#o43736 "Database requirements") section. Also, please consult applicable Microsoft guidelines for the SQL Server database edition that best fits your requirements.

### Hardware requirement guidelines

Hardware requirements vary depending on the WhatsUp Gold configuration. Increasing the number of devices monitored, number of monitors, types of monitors, polling intervals, or other configuration options can result in additional load on the server and database. Hardware configuration adjustments may be required to optimize performance for your network.

\*The performance for the number of devices and monitors supported is dependent upon several system variables such as server processor and memory size, polling frequency, round-trip time (RTT) for polling distance, the amount of time for which data is archived in the database, types of monitors polled (for example, SNMP-type monitors are significantly more efficient than WMI monitors), and other factors.

Please note, Ipswitch has successfully tested the USR3500 Courier M2M 3G GSM Intelligent Cellular Modem from USRobotics which supports a wider set of bands and cellular technology.

#### Recommendations for accessing WhatsUp Gold 2018

Ipswitch recommends accessing the WhatsUp Gold server using a browser installed on a remote machine. The following specifications are recommended for optimal performance when accessing the WhatsUp Gold server.

|  | **100 Devices /** **500 Monitors\*****minimum required** | **2,500 Devices /** **12,500 Monitors\*****minimum required** | **20,000 Devices /****100,000 Monitors\*****minimum required** |

| **RAM** | 8 GB | 8 GB | 16 GB |
| **Processor** | i5 Class | i7 Class | i7 Class |
| **Video display resolution** | 1280 x 1024 or higher | 1280 x 1024 or higher | 1280 x 1024 or higher |
| **Sound card** | SAPI-capable sound card required for Text-to-Speech actions | SAPI-capable sound card required for Text-to-Speech actions | SAPI-capable sound card required for Text-to-Speech actions |

\*The performance for the number of devices and monitors supported is dependent upon several system variables such as server processor and memory size, polling frequency, round-trip time (RTT) for polling distance, the amount of time for which data is archived in the database, types of monitors polled (for example, SNMP-type monitors are significantly more efficient than WMI monitors), and other factors.

### Poller requirements

Depending on the network environment and product deployment, WhatsUp Gold can poll up to a maximum of 20,000 devices and up to 100,000 monitors with one WhatsUp Gold server and additional pollers (additional pollers required depend on the amount of SNMP and WMI monitors). Additional pollers installed on your WhatsUp Gold system transmit active monitor and performance monitor data to the WhatsUp Gold server. Extending polling activity across multiple pollers increases the number of devices for which WhatsUp Gold can poll and collect data to send back to the WhatsUp Gold system. Using additional pollers, WhatsUp Gold can efficiently scale polling operations to a larger number of network devices, ultimately providing the capacity to monitor and manage larger networks. Additional pollers may be installed on any Windows system on the network, other than the WhatsUp Gold server.

|  | **Minimum required for each** **additional poller** |
| --- | --- |
| **Processor(s)** | Dual-core |
| **Processor speed** | 2 GHz |
| **RAM** | 4 GB |
| **Hard drive space for application** | 2 GB |
| **Network interface card** | 100 Mbps |
| **OS support** | See Operating system and virtual environment requirements section above |

#### Installing WhatsUp Gold 2018

WhatsUp Gold 2018 supports direct upgrade installations from WhatsUp Gold v16.x, or 17.x. If you upgrade from a previous version of WhatsUp Gold, make sure to clear the browser cache so the user interface displays the new web application pages after the upgrade. Refer to the Installing WhatsUp Gold guide for details about installation, upgrade, repair, and uninstall. As always, before performing an upgrade be sure to back up your database, if using the SQL Express database included in WhatsUp Gold this can be done by the installer/updater before proceeding with the upgrade.

**Important**: Ipswitch does not support upgrades for WhatsUp Gold custom database modifications.

If the WhatsUp Gold installer detects database changes to your WhatsUp Gold database schema, it warns you of the issues and proceeds with the install. In future WhatsUp Gold releases, the installer will not proceed until the installer warnings are addressed.

### Offline Installation and Activation

**Important**: If you are unable to connect to the Internet, you must use the offline installer package to install WhatsUp Gold. Download the package from your Ipswitch Account using a connected machine, then run the installer on your designated server. When prompted to enter your activation number, select Use offline activation mode and proceed with the activation process. If you are an evaluator and do not have access to an Ipswitch Account, please contact Ipswitch Customer Service for assistance.

**Note**: Customers with pure IPv6 environments must use offline activation.

#### Troubleshooting

### Potential SQL Server installation errors

* DO NOT use Terminal Services or Remote Desktop for the installation. The installation or upgrade may fail.
* A Group Policy Object (GPO), applied on your domain, that has removed or altered the user rights of the `WhatsUpGold_User` account on the WhatsUp Gold server can cause a generic 503 Service Unavailable Error to be displayed after the WhatsUp Gold installation. To correct the error and verify/restore applicable settings, see [Group Policy Object 503 Service Unavailable Error](index.htm#o40230 "Group Policy Object 503 Service Unavailable error").
* There are known issues with installing WhatsUp Gold on a domain controller, therefore installing WhatsUp Gold on a domain controller is not a supported install scenario.
* If there was a previous, non-default installation of WhatsUp Gold, a "WhatsUp" Data Source (DSN) may still exist. Remove the WhatsUp DSN from the Data Sources (ODBC) Control Panel and restart the install.

### Configuring the firewall to allow WMI traffic

WhatsUp Gold uses Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to monitor and restart Windows Services. For each device that is assigned an NT Service Active Monitor, you must supply the Windows credentials. Also, when creating a Service Restart Action, you must supply Windows credentials for each Action. Credentials must have administrative permissions on the remote server. Local accounts with credentials that match remote accounts are no longer required to monitor remote servers.

For more Troubleshooting information, see the Troubleshooting section in the application Help or refer to the [WhatsUp Gold Support Site](https://www.ipswitch.com/support/).

##### Group Policy Object 503 Service Unavailable error

A Group Policy Object (GPO) applied on your domain which has removed or altered the user rights of the `WhatsUpGold_User` account on the Network Performance Monitor server can cause a generic 503 Service Unavailable Error to be displayed following Network Performance Monitor installation. The account is created during Network Performance Monitor installation and is used for the identity of the Network Performance Monitor application pool in IIS as well as the account with rights to the NPM virtual directory. This user should be added to the Local Administrators group and should not be removed.

To correct the error, verify/restore applicable settings using the following procedures:

1. Ensure the `WhatsUpGold_User` account exists on the Network Performance Monitor server:
   1. From the WhatsUp Gold server desktop, click **Start > Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Computer Management**.
   2. Expand Local Users and Groups in the Computer Management navigation tree.
   3. Click **Users**. If the `WhatsUpGold_User` account is not displayed, a GPO conflict exists and needs to be resolved at the Domain Controller.
2. Ensure the `WhatsUp_Gold User` is a member of the Local Administrators group on the Network Performance Monitor server:
   1. From the Network Performance Monitor server desktop, click **Start > Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Computer Management**.
   2. Expand Local Users and Groups in the Computer Management navigation tree.
   3. Click **Groups**.
   4. Double-click **Administrators**. If the `WhatsUpGold_User` account is not displayed, a GPO conflict exists and needs to be resolved at the Domain Controller.
3. Ensure the Local Administrators group has the Logon as a batch job Local Security option enabled:
   1. From the Network Performance Monitor server desktop, click **Start > Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Local Security Policy**.
   2. Expand Local Policies in the Security Settings navigation tree.
   3. Click **User Rights Assignment**.
   4. Double-click **Logon as batch job**. If the Administrators group is not displayed, a GPO conflict exists and needs to be resolved at the Domain Controller.

**Important**: If changes are made using these procedures, in IIS the Application pool Nmconsole is stopped. IIS needs to be restarted prior to continuing. Additionally, Event Viewer displays the following:

*Application pool ASP.NET v4.0 has been disabled. Windows Process Activation Service (WAS) encountered a failure when it started a worker process to serve the application pool.*

*Application pool ASP.NET v4.0 has been disabled. Windows Process Activation Service (WAS) did not create a worker process to serve the application pool because the application pool identity is invalid.*
