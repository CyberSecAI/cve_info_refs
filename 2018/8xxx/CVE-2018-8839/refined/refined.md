Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is a stack-based buffer overflow in the Delta Electronics PMSoft software when processing `.ppm` files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Multiple stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist due to the application's fixed-length stack buffer not being able to handle larger values from the `.ppm` file.
- This allows for overwriting the buffer which can lead to arbitrary code execution or an application crash.
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to:
    - Arbitrary code execution, giving the attacker control over the system running PMSoft.
    - Application crash, disrupting the normal operation of the software.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves crafting a malicious `.ppm` file with data that exceeds the buffer's capacity.
- The vulnerability requires the user to open a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious `.ppm` file.
- The attacker needs to trick the user into opening the malicious `.ppm` file in PMSoft, which is a user interaction requirement.
- According to the advisory the vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is assigned CVE-2018-8839 with a CVSS v3 base score of 7.1 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H).
- The affected product is PMSoft v2.10 and prior.
- The advisory mentions that the exploitation requires a "Low skill level"
- The fix is to update PMSoft to v2.11 or later.
