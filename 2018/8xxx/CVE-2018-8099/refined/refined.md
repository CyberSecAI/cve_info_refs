Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-8099:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the incorrect handling of error codes in the `index.c:read_entry()` function of libgit2. The function was returning a size_t value, which was also used to indicate errors (specifically by returning -1). Because size_t is unsigned, -1 would wrap to a very large positive number. This caused the caller of the function, `parse_index`, to continue processing the index with an invalid size, potentially leading to issues when the data is freed later.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Error Handling:** The `read_entry` function used its return value both for indicating the size of the index entry and for signaling an error, leading to confusion and incorrect processing when an error occurred.
- **Double Free:** Due to the incorrect return value, memory might be freed twice, causing a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can trigger a double-free, causing the application using libgit2 to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted Repository Index File:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious repository index file. An attacker can manipulate the index file to trigger the error condition in `read_entry`, leading to a double free.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to provide a crafted repository index file**  An attacker needs to be able to supply the vulnerable system with a specially crafted Git repository index file. This may occur when a user clones or processes a malicious repository.

**Additional Details (from the provided commit log):**

- The commit log from GitHub indicates that the `read_entry` function was modified to use an out parameter for the index entry size and to use its return value exclusively for error codes. This change fixes the vulnerability by ensuring that the calling function, `parse_index` receives an error when it should.
