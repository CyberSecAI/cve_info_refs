{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly validate the `oldimg` parameter before using it in a file deletion operation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Arbitrary file deletion due to lack of input validation on the `oldimg` parameter.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server, including critical files, potentially leading to complete compromise of the application or data loss.  It is explicitly stated that deleting install.lock could allow for CMS reinstallation and potentially hijacking of the website database.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET/POST requests to `licence_save.php` with a crafted `oldimg` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `licence_save.php` script and provide a valid `oldimg` value that exists on the server. The attacker also needs to bypass the check `$oldimg<>$img && $oldimg<>\"/image/nopic.gif\"`"
