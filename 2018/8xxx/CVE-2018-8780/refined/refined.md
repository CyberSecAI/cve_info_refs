Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-8780:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The provided content explicitly mentions **CVE-2018-8780** and its description, "Unintentional directory traversal by poisoned NULL byte in Dir", across multiple sources including Red Hat, Debian, SUSE, and Ruby. This confirms the content's relevance.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of NULL bytes in the path arguments of the `Dir.open`, `Dir.new`, `Dir.entries`, and `Dir.empty?` methods in Ruby. These methods fail to check for and sanitize NULL bytes, which can then be used by an attacker to cause the methods to recognize the directory path as complete before the NULL byte, enabling path traversal outside the intended directory.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of input validation and sanitization for the path parameter of `Dir` class methods, allowing NULL bytes to effectively truncate path strings.
*   **Directory Traversal:** The vulnerable methods, including `Dir.open`, `Dir.new`, `Dir.entries` and `Dir.empty?`, enable unintentional directory traversal due to the mishandling of NULL bytes.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Directory Access:** Exploiting this vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass intended directory access restrictions, potentially reading sensitive files, listing unauthorized directories and performing operations outside intended locations on the file system.
*   **Unintentional socket creation** (as referenced in associated CVE-2018-8779)

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector involves supplying crafted strings containing NULL bytes to the `Dir` methods mentioned above. The attacker needs to control the input of the vulnerable application.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Code Injection/External Input:** The attacker needs the ability to influence the input to ruby programs or libraries using the vulnerable `Dir` methods.
*   **Network Access:** Some attack vectors might be achieved remotely through network-accessible Ruby applications or services.
*   **Local Access:** Local users with the ability to run ruby scripts can also be the attacker.

**Summary of Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of NULL byte handling in path arguments of specific `Dir` class methods.
*   **Weakness:** Improper input validation, directory traversal.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary directory access or traversal, potentially leading to unintended file creation and information disclosure, unintentional socket creation.
*   **Attack Vector:** Crafted path strings containing NULL bytes supplied to vulnerable Ruby methods.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Code injection into ruby scripts or the ability to pass malicious path arguments to the vulnerable methods.
