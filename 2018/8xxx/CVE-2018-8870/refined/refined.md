- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Medtronic MyCareLink Patient Monitor contains a hard-coded operating system password.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of hard-coded password (CWE-259).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with physical access can gain privileged access to the monitor's operating system. Additionally, the vulnerabilities can allow a MyCareLink monitor, when operated in close proximity to an implantable cardiac device, to read and write arbitrary memory values of that device via debug functionality (CWE-749, CVE-2018-8868).
- **Attack vectors:** Physical access to the device is required. The attacker needs to remove the case of the device and connect to the debug port. The debug functionality is then accessed using the hardcoded password.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires physical access to the device and needs to be physically close to the implantable device to exploit the arbitrary memory read/write vulnerability. A high skill level is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
