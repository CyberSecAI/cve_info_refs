{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a result of insufficient checks during URL processing in Microsoft Edge, specifically within the `EdgeUrlUtils::IsAboutFlagsResUri` method, which incorrectly identifies certain URLs as requiring privileged content processes. Additionally, an inadequate check in the compatibility view list handling allows for the use of arbitrary schemes like 'file://'. Finally, a flaw in Internet Explorer's handling of 'file://' scheme URLs when they point to folders can be bypassed by crafted lnk files, allowing arbitrary file execution.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient URL validation in `EdgeUrlUtils::IsAboutFlagsResUri`, which allows for the execution of arbitrary javascript code in a privileged process",
         "Inadequate scheme validation for compatibility view redirects, allowing 'file://' scheme",
        "Improper handling of 'file://' scheme URLs by Internet Explorer, which does not properly validate folders and allows for lnk file execution",
       "Lack of proper sanitization and validation of URLs"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution, leading to a sandbox escape from Microsoft Edge and ultimately executing code in Internet Explorer context.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafting a malicious URL that bypasses Edge's URL validation.",
        "Using a domain present in IE's compatibility view to redirect to an arbitrary scheme, such as `file://`.",
        "Employing a crafted lnk file that bypasses the folder check in IE and allows execution of an arbitrary file."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": [
        "Ability to inject JavaScript into a web page.",
        "Access to a machine that can host a samba server and is also in the IE compatibility list (or able to modify the hosts file for testing)",
        "Ability to create a crafted lnk file that bypasses the folder check in IE"
