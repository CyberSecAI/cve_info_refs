- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Notification Center of Synology Calendar.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing the injection of arbitrary web script or HTML.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful XSS attack can lead to the execution of malicious scripts in the context of the victim's browser, potentially allowing an attacker to steal cookies, hijack user sessions, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through the "title" parameter in the Notification Center of Synology Calendar.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a remote, authenticated user of the Synology Calendar. The attacker must also trick a user to trigger the malicious payload by viewing the crafted title.
