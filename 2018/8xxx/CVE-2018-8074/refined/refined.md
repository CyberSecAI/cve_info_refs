The provided content discusses a security vulnerability in the Yii framework related to the `findOne()` and `findAll()` methods in the `yii\elasticsearch\ActiveRecord` class. This aligns with CVE-2018-8074.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `findOne()` and `findAll()` methods in `yii\elasticsearch\ActiveRecord` did not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input when used as search criteria.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Input Handling:** The methods directly used user-provided input to construct Elasticsearch queries, allowing injection of arbitrary search conditions.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code did not sanitize or validate the input before using it to create the Elasticsearch query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Altered Search Results:** Attackers could inject malicious search conditions that would return different results than intended.
- **Error Responses:**  Malicious input could cause the Elasticsearch server to return errors.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct User Input:** Passing unsanitized user-provided data directly to `findOne()` or `findAll()` methods.
- The vulnerability is present if the application does not ensure that scalar values are passed to the methods, or if the application accepts input that can modify the structure of array inputs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to control the input that is passed to the `findOne()` or `findAll()` methods.
- This can be through a variety of means, such as by manipulating request parameters.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is fixed in `yiisoft/yii2-elasticsearch` version 2.0.5 and later.
- The document advises users to not only upgrade but to also review all usages of these methods to ensure proper input sanitization.
- The document explains that methods `where()` and `filterWhere()` also do not escape column names, so this is an additional area to review to ensure they are not vulnerable.
- The patch only fixes the most direct issues such as SQL injection. Applications using user input with these methods must be reviewed and modified to avoid further issues.
