- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Attachment Preview feature of Synology Drive.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied data when rendering attachment previews, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML, potentially leading to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of web pages
  - Phishing attacks
  - Other malicious actions within the user's browser context.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is triggered through a malicious attachment.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be a remote authenticated user of the affected Synology Drive instance.
    - The attacker needs to be able to upload a crafted file attachment.
    - The user needs to interact with the attachment, likely by previewing it.
