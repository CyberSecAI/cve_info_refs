Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-8060:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies within the HWiNFO AMD64 Kernel driver (version 8.98 and lower) which allows unprivileged users to send IOCTLs to the device driver without proper validation of input and output buffers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Null Pointer Dereference (CWE-476):**  The driver doesn't properly handle null or invalid input/output buffer pointers, leading to a null pointer dereference.
*   **Improper Address Validation in IOCTL with METHOD_NEITHER I/O Control Code (CWE-781):** The driver may not be validating buffer addresses correctly when using `METHOD_NEITHER`, which allows user-supplied addresses to be passed directly to the kernel.
*   **Lack of Privilege Checks:** The driver does not properly check if the caller has the required privileges to perform the requested IOCTL operations.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Kernel Panic / Blue Screen of Death:** Exploiting the vulnerability can cause a kernel panic, resulting in a system crash (Blue Screen of Death on Windows).
*   **Denial of Service:** The crash leads to a denial of service as the system becomes unusable.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **IOCTL Sending:** Attackers send specific IOCTL codes to the HWiNFO driver.
*   **Unprivileged User:** The attack can be performed by an unprivileged user, meaning no special privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Malformed Input/Output Buffers:** Specifically crafted input/output buffers are sent to trigger the vulnerability, including null pointers.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system where the vulnerable driver is loaded.
*   **Ability to send IOCTLs:** The attacker needs to be able to send IO control codes to the HWiNFO device driver.

**Additional details from the content:**
* The provided code repository includes a simple IOCTL dispatcher to send IOCTLs, which can be used to trigger the vulnerability.
* The easiest way to trigger the vulnerability is by supplying a null pointer as the input buffer.
* The targeted device driver is identified as "HWiNFO32".
* The vulnerability is related to IOCTLs above 0x85FE2600.
