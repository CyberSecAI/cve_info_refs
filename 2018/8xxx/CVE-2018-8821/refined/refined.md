The provided content is a GitHub repository page for a project named "poc" by user "bigric3". The README.md file within the repository explicitly states "Assigned cve-2018-8821", suggesting the repository contains a proof of concept (PoC) related to CVE-2018-8821. It includes a GIF demonstrating the exploit, and a binary executable called `dos_poc.exe`. This likely is a proof of concept for a denial-of-service vulnerability.

Based on the information, we can derive:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The content strongly implies the `dos_poc.exe` is the root cause of the denial of service vulnerability. 
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Denial of Service vulnerability, exploited through a binary executable.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service, possibly crashing or making a targeted system unavailable.
*   **Attack vectors:** Executing the malicious binary file (`dos_poc.exe`).
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to download and execute the provided binary file on the target system.

The content provides more details than the official CVE description, including the existence of an executable PoC.
