# /user/ppsave.php

## Edition :

zzcms 8.2

## Location

`/user/ppsave.php`

### Code:

```
if ($oldimg<>$img && $oldimg<>"image/nopic.gif") {
	//deloldimg
		$f=$oldimg;
		if (file_exists($f)){
		unlink($f);
		}
		$fs=str_replace(".","_small.",$oldimg);
		if (file_exists($fs)){
		unlink($fs);
		}
```

### Rows : 68

### Harm

Allows attackers to delete files arbitrarily

### Cause the cause

First analyze the code, the first condition is `action=modify`

[![](/Ni9htMar3/vulnerability/raw/master/zzcms_8.2/images/24.png "24")](/Ni9htMar3/vulnerability/blob/master/zzcms_8.2/images/24.png)

There is no other previous condition, just can directly control oldimg

## poc

[![](/Ni9htMar3/vulnerability/raw/master/zzcms_8.2/images/25.png "25")](/Ni9htMar3/vulnerability/blob/master/zzcms_8.2/images/25.png)

An attacker can use this vulnerability to delete any file, such as deleting install.lock for CMS reinstall and hijacking the website database.

## Solution

Can be filtered through the input of control parameters, strictly control the type of parameters, suffixes
