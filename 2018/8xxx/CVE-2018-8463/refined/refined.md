{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from improper URL handling in Microsoft Edge's `LCIEUrlPolicy::GetPICForPrivilegedInternalPage` method within `eModel.dll`, specifically in `EdgeUrlUtils::IsAboutFlagsResUri`. The method fails to correctly validate URLs, allowing a crafted URL to be recognized as requiring a privileged content process.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Inadequate URL validation in `EdgeUrlUtils::IsAboutFlagsResUri`.",
    "Lack of scheme restriction when launching Internet Explorer for compatibility in a privileged content process.",
     "Bypassing folder check in Internet Explorer when using 'file://' scheme, by using a crafted .lnk file."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Allows an attacker to escape the sandbox, execute arbitrary code in a privileged context and ultimately on the system by leveraging Internet Explorer vulnerabilities.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Crafted 'res' scheme URL to trigger a privileged process within Microsoft Edge.",
    "JavaScript navigation to the 'res' scheme (requires an additional exploit).",
    "Request to launch IE for some sites with an arbitrary scheme from privileged content process.",
    "File scheme to execute arbitrary files using ShellExecuteExW on internet explorer."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "Ability to trigger a navigation in Microsoft Edge.",
     "Ability to host a samba server reachable by a domain in the IE compatibility view list, or modification of the hosts file for testing.",
     "Ability to create a crafted .lnk file.",
    "Knowledge of hardcoded offsets for a specific build of Windows (e.g., 'Build 17692.rs_prerelease.180609-1317')."
