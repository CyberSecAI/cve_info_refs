  "CVE-2018-8174": {
    "related": true,
    "info": "The vulnerability is a use-after-free issue in the VBScript engine, specifically within the VariantClear function in oleaut32.dll.",
    "root_cause": "The VBScriptClass::Release function checks the object reference count *before* calling VBScriptClass::TerminateClass. The Class_Terminate event handler can increase the reference count of the object being destroyed, but the subsequent cleanup process does not account for this, leading to the object being freed while still referenced. This results in a dangling pointer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-After-Free (UAF)",
      "Dangling Pointer"
     ],
    "impact": "Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code by exploiting the use-after-free vulnerability.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted VBScript code.",
      "Web pages using vbscript (Internet Explorer)."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to get the victim to execute the malicious vbscript. This can be achieved by hosting it on a website and getting the user to visit this website in IE. "
