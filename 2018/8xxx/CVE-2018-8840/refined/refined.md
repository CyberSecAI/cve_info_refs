Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-8840:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `TCPServer.dll` module of InduSoft Web Studio and InTouch Machine Edition due to the use of the `mbstowcs()` function when handling command 50.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121). The `mbstowcs()` function is vulnerable to overflowing the buffer when processing an overly large input from a network packet.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: A successful attack can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system with the privileges of the vulnerable service. This could lead to complete compromise of the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: A remote attacker sends a specially crafted network packet to a vulnerable service. The vulnerability is triggered during tag, alarm, or event related actions, such as read and write operations within the applications.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the target system
- Ability to send network packets. The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2017-14024, which also involves a buffer overflow in `TCPServer.dll` but leverages command 49 instead of command 50.
- A proof of concept (PoC) is provided, demonstrating a simple network packet that triggers the overflow.
- The affected products are InduSoft Web Studio v8.1 and prior versions, and InTouch Machine Edition 2017 v8.1 and prior versions.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Tenable Research.
