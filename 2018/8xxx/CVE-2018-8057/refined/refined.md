Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2018-8057:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the `channel_name` and `platform` parameters within the `/application/controllers/manage/channel.php` file of Cobub Razor 0.8.0. Specifically, user-supplied input is directly used in SQL queries without any checks or filtering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, specifically error-based and AND/OR time-based blind SQL injection. This allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious code through the vulnerable parameters.
*   **Path Leakage:** While not the main focus of CVE-2018-8057,  there is also a mention of physical path leakage through some URLs, like `/export.php` and `/index.php?/manage/channel/addchannel`.
*   **SWF Cross Site Scripting** A SWF file was found vulnerable to XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Information Disclosure:** Successful SQL injection can lead to full disclosure of the application's database. This includes potentially sensitive data such as user credentials, application data, etc.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  In some cases, successful SQL injection can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code on the server (though this is not explicitly stated in the provided information, it is a common risk with SQLi).
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:**  The attacker could modify or delete data within the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Requests:** The primary attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to specific endpoints.
    *  `/index.php?/manage/channel/addchannel`
    *   `/index.php?/manage/channel/addsychannel`
    *   `/index.php?/manage/channel/modifychannel`
*   **Vulnerable Parameters:** The `channel_name` and `platform` parameters within those requests are the primary injection points.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of web application vulnerabilities, HTTP requests, and SQL injection techniques.
*   **No Authentication Required for Path Leakage** Path leakage vulnerability is available without authentication

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Code Location:** `/application/controllers/manage/channel.php` at line 75-95.
*   **Vulnerable Parameters:** `channel_name`, `platform`.
*   **SQL Injection Types:** Error-based, and AND/OR time-based blind SQL injection.
*   **Payload Examples:**
    *   `channel_name=test" AND (SELECT 1700 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x7171706b71,(SELECT (ELT(1700=1700,1))),0x71786a7671,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS GROUP BY x)a)-- JQon&platform=1`
    *   `channel_name=test" AND SLEEP(5)-- NklJ&platform=1`
    *   `channel_name=1&platform=1%22`
    *  `channel_id=1212%22&channel_name=xss><svg/onload=alert(1)>&platform=1`
*   **Additional Vulnerability:** A SWF file, `uploadify.swf` is vulnerable to XSS

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content contains PoCs and SQLmap results, confirming the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is present in Cobub Razor version 0.8.0 and earlier.
*   The exploit-db entry (44454) confirms the same findings.
