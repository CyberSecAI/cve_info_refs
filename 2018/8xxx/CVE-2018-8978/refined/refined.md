- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application's source code allows arbitrary web applications to accept untrusted input that can cause the application to redirect to a URL contained within that untrusted input. Additionally, the application does not properly sanitize user input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Open Redirect: The application redirects to URLs specified in the `redirect_url` parameter without proper validation.
  - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application does not properly sanitize user input, allowing injection of malicious scripts via crafted URLs.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
  - Open Redirect: Attackers can redirect users to malicious sites, potentially leading to phishing scams and credential theft.
  - Reflected XSS: Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or further attacks.

- **Attack vectors:**
  - Open Redirect: Modifying the `redirect_url` parameter in the URL.
  - Reflected XSS: Injecting malicious scripts through crafted URLs, specifically by using a crafted `img` tag with an `onerror` attribute.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs with malicious payloads and convince users to click them. This can be achieved through phishing attacks, malicious links on websites, or other social engineering methods.
