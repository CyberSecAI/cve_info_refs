- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in the Attachment Preview feature of Synology Note Station.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization when handling file attachments, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML. This could lead to actions such as stealing session cookies, performing actions on behalf of the user, or redirecting users to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a malicious attachment. An authenticated user needs to upload a crafted file that contains malicious script or HTML. When the attachment is previewed, the embedded script will execute within the user's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a remote, authenticated user to exploit the vulnerability. The user also needs to entice a victim to preview the malicious attachment.
