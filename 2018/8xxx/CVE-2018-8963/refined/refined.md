The provided content describes multiple heap-use-after-free vulnerabilities in the `decompile.c` file of the libming library, specifically within the `decompileGETVARIABLE`, `decompileSingleArgBuiltInFunctionCall`, `decompilePUSHPARAM`, `decompileDELETE`, `decompileSETTARGET`, `decompileSUBSTRING`, `decompileNEWOBJECT` and `decompileIMPLEMENTS` functions.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a use-after-free condition caused by incorrect memory management in the `decompile.c` file, when processing SWF files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-use-after-free: The program attempts to access memory that has already been freed. This can cause crashes and potentially allow for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Crash: The most immediate impact is a crash of the `swftophp` tool, triggered when processing a crafted SWF file.
- Potential arbitrary code execution: A heap-use-after-free can be further exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution by manipulating the freed memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious SWF file: The vulnerability is triggered by parsing a specially crafted SWF file using the `swftophp` tool.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide a crafted SWF file to the `swftophp` tool.

**Functions affected:**
- `decompileGETVARIABLE`
- `decompileSingleArgBuiltInFunctionCall`
- `decompilePUSHPARAM`
- `decompileDELETE`
- `decompileSETTARGET`
- `decompileSUBSTRING`
- `decompileNEWOBJECT`
- `decompileIMPLEMENTS`
