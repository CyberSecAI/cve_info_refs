### Version 1.5 Highlights

#### Security Improvements

The Kontena Vault now uses a stronger key derived from the configured VAULT\_KEY for encrypting vault secrets. The configured VAULT\_KEY was previously truncated to the first 32 bytes, limiting the effective AES-CBC key strength to 128 bits for hexadecimal values, or 192 bits for base64-encoded values. Existing vault secrets will be re-encrypted using the stronger key on upgrade. (PR [#3248](https://github.com/kontena/kontena/pull/3248) / Issue [#3247](https://github.com/kontena/kontena/issues/3247%5D)

The Kontena Vault secrets are now encrypted using a random AES-CBC Initialization Vector (IV) that is randomized for each secret. The configured VAULT\_IV was previously used as a static IV shared across all encrypted secrets, but is no longer required. Existing vault secrets will be re-encrypted using randomized IVs on upgrade. (PR [#3184](https://github.com/kontena/kontena/pull/3184) / Issue [#3183](https://github.com/kontena/kontena/issues/3183)

A potential XSS vulnerability in the "kontena master login --remote" code display has been fixed. ([#3223](https://github.com/kontena/kontena/pull/3223))

#### Options After Parameters

Commands that accept parameters now accept options also after the parameter. For example,

these commands did not work before:

```
$ kontena stack deploy example-stack --help
ERROR: too many arguments
$ kontena stack rm example-stack --force
ERROR: too many arguments

```

Note that if you need to use something that looks like an option as a parameter you need to use the

common double dash `--` option break indicator:

```
$ kontena master ssh -- ls -al
ERROR: Unrecognised option '-l'
$ kontena master ssh -- ls -al
$ kontena vault write -- SECRET --secret-password--

```
#### Kontena Stack Registry V2 API And The New 'meta' Fields

While mostly invisible to the end-user, the CLI stack registry API client is now using

the completely rewritten stack registry and the V2 JSON-API it offers. The registry

supports GZip responses, private stacks, server-side stack YAML validation and parsing

of the new top level 'meta:' fields.

The meta fields can be used to add extra information to stacks published in the registry.

You can find the full set of accepted metadata fields in the pull request [#3219](https://github.com/kontena/kontena/pull/3219) description.

As the CLI HTTP client now supports gzip compressed responses, we have also added the option

to enable compression in the Kontena Master API. To enable, set `KONTENA_SERVER_GZIP=true`

in the Master environment.

#### Drop Support For Ruby 2.1, Build Installer With Embedded Ruby 2.5.0

As Ruby 2.1 branch has been out of development for almost a year now, it's time to upgrade

if you already didn't.

The MacOS Kontena CLI installation package is now bundled with Ruby version 2.5.0

Ruby 2.2 is nearing its EOL at the end of March 2018.

#### Process Multiple Items In One Command

Many of the subcommands can now accept a list of items instead of just one. This is handy in

shell scripts and one-liners, for example:

```
$ kontena vault ls -q | xargs kontena vault rm --force
$ kontena vault rm --force $(kontena vault ls -q)

```
#### Master Authentication Token Descriptions

You can now add descriptions to the master authentication tokens:

```
$ kontena master token create -e 0 --description "deploy key"
$ kontena master token ls
ID                         TOKEN_TYPE   TOKEN_LAST4   EXPIRES_IN   SCOPES       DESCRIPTION
5a8c275351d1a1001566a4ef   bearer       f539          never        user         deploy key

```
#### Health Check

The agent now uses the port in health check definition when configuring the load balancer. (PR [#3113](https://github.com/kontena/kontena/pull/) / Issue [#1709](https://github.com/kontena/kontena/issues/1709))

Example configuration:

```
    health_check:
      protocol: http
      uri: /
      port: 8000

```

The health check will now consider HTTP 3XX status codes as healthy. (PR [#3265](https://github.com/kontena/kontena/pull/3265) / Issue [#1790](https://github.com/kontena/kontena/issues/1790))

#### Logging Container Crashes

It was previously not possible to see if a container restarted because it crashed or if it was intentional and caused by for example a deploy or a manual restart. ([#3286](https://github.com/kontena/kontena/pull/3286))

```
2018-02-16T14:43:26.731698302Z container die 9d21e309419ffbd32d75ab4bf544baf4deefb491934a762fc88b5c34a3071a52 (exitCode=137...)

```
#### Service Affinities

When scheduling a service with an affinity like `service==api` affinity, only the bare service names were previously matched without considering their stack scope. If multiple stacks had identically named services that match the affinity filter, then all of those external services would have been considered as matching candidates. (PR [#2967](https://github.com/kontena/kontena/pull/2967) / Issue [#2911](https://github.com/kontena/kontena/issues/2961))

You can now set the stack scoped affinity as `service==stack/api`.

The affinity filters can now also include regular expressions such as `node!=/^node-(2|3)$/`. (PR [#3099](https://github.com/kontena/kontena/pull/3099) / Issue [#2909](https://github.com/kontena/kontena/issues/2909))

#### Daemon Strategy Node Stickiness

When a service has been deployed using the daemon strategy and a node goes offline, the scheduler now keeps the existing instances on the nodes they were running on already. ([#3137](https://github.com/kontena/kontena/pull/3137))

| Node | All Online | Node 2 Offline Before 1.5 | Node 2 Offline With Kontena 1.5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | instance-1 | instance-1 | instance-1 |
| 2 | instance-2 |  |  |
| 3 | instance-3 | instance-2 | instance-3 |
| 4 | instance-4 | instance-3 | instance-2 |

#### Let's Encrypt Certificate Challenges

The Kontena Let's Encrypt certificate integration now supports http-01 challenges as a replacement for the disabled tls-sni-01 challenges. (PR [#3212](https://github.com/kontena/kontena/pull/3212) / Issue [#3209](https://github.com/kontena/kontena/issues/3209))

It's possible to inject javascript into the remote login HTML page.

Exploitability is quite small, the attacker would have to trick the user to go to something like `master_url/code#code=abcd<script>alert("foo")</script>`.

Since the master does not have any cookie authentication and the browser won't send any bearer auth headers, the attacker would seem to have very little to gain by doing so.

One possible attack could be to display a fake cloud login screen.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| I can't repro this, at least on firefox the `window.location.hash` is URL-encoded, so the resulting `document.write(...)` not actually HTML:  ``` >>> window.location.hash "#code=foo%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22foo%22)%3C/script%3Ebar"  ```  EDIT: this seems specific to firefox, with chrome it ends up getting blocked by the XSS auditor? |

### **[SpComb](/SpComb)** commented [Feb 2, 2018](#issuecomment-362618383)

| Anyways, the right way to fix this XSS is to replace the `document.write` with an insintrically safe method like `innerText = ...`: <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/DOM_based_XSS_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet#RULE_.237_-_Fixing_DOM_Cross-site_Scripting_Vulnerabilities>  ```     <div id="code" style='...'></div>     <script>       var code = window.location.hash.split('code=')[1].split('&')[0];       document.getElementById("code").innerText = code;     </script>  ```  Trying to regexp your way out of XSS injection usually just ends in tears. |

# The next step for LGTM.com: GitHub code scanning!

Today, GitHub code scanning has all of LGTM.comâs key featuresâand more! The time has therefore come to announce the plan for the gradual deprecation of LGTM.com.

Three years ago, [the team that built LGTM.com joined GitHub](https://github.blog/2019-09-18-github-welcomes-semmle/). From that moment on, we have worked tirelessly to natively integrate its underlying CodeQL analysis technology into GitHub. In 2020, GitHub code scanning was [launched](https://github.blog/2020-05-06-new-from-satellite-2020-github-codespaces-github-discussions-securing-code-in-private-repositories-and-more/#security) in public beta, and later that year it became [generally available](https://github.blog/2020-09-30-code-scanning-is-now-available/) for everyone. GitHub code scanning is powered by the very same analysis engine: CodeQL.

Weâve since continued to invest in CodeQL and GitHub code scanning. Today, GitHub code scanning has all of LGTM.comâs key featuresâand [more](https://github.blog/changelog/label/code-scanning/)! The time has therefore come to announce the plan for the gradual deprecation of LGTM.com.

### End of August 2022: no more user sign-ups and new repositories

Starting at the end of August, LGTM.com will no longer accept new user sign-ups. It will also no longer be possible to add new repositories for analysis to LGTM.com. Existing users will continue to be able to log in and use LGTM.com, and the analysis of existing repositories will continue to work. However, [historical analysis](https://lgtm.com/help/lgtm/viewing-history-of-project) will no longer be performedâonly new commits will be analyzed.

### October: help migrate repositories to GitHub code scanning

We will do our best to help migrate repositories that actively use LGTM.com to flag potential security issues in their pull requests. For those repositories, we will create pull requests that add a [GitHub Actions workflow that runs code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/setting-up-code-scanning-for-a-repository#setting-up-code-scanning-manually). Once that configuration file is merged, the repositoryâs source code (and future pull requests) will be scanned by GitHub code scanning. GitHub code scanning will flag any potential security issues [in pull requests](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-06-02-users-can-view-and-comment-on-code-scanning-alerts-on-the-conversation-tab-in-a-pull-request/) and on the repositoryâs [security tab](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/managing-code-scanning-alerts-for-your-repository). Once thatâs all working as it should, you can disable the LGTM.com integration.

Some repositories make use of advanced LGTM.com build and analysis configurations. In such cases, we might not be able to automatically propose a GitHub Actions workflow to set up code scanning. We will notify such repositories directly.

### End of November: new commits and pull requests are no longer analyzed

At the end of November, LGTM.com will stop fetching new commits for the repositories that it analyzes. It will also stop analyzing pull requests on GitHub.com. Repositories that still use LGTM.comâs pull request analysis in the week(s) leading up to this deprecation phase will be reminded through a message in the pull request comments that are posted by LGTM.com.

### 16th of December: LGTM.com will be shut down

From the 16th of December, LGTM.com will no longer be available. This includes but is not limited to:

* [LGTM.com code quality badges](https://lgtm.com/help/lgtm/adding-badges-to-project-readme-files)
* The LGTM query console (including historical results)
* The LGTM documentation
* All LGTM.com APIs

## So long and thanks for all the fish!

On behalf of the entire LGTM.com team, weâd like to thank you all for joining us on this wonderful journey. From launching LGTM.com back in 2017, all the way through [GitHubâs acquisition of Semmle in 2019](https://github.blog/2019-09-18-github-welcomes-semmle/), the subsequent [launch of GitHub code scanning](https://github.blog/2020-05-06-new-from-satellite-2020-github-codespaces-github-discussions-securing-code-in-private-repositories-and-more/#security), and all the [improvements weâve since shipped](https://github.blog/changelog/label/code-scanning/): itâs been an absolutely amazing journey. Thank you!
