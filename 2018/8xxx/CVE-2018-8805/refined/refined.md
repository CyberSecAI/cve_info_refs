{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of input and output filtering for the 'content' variable in the guestbook functionality of YXcms, specifically in the `_guestbook.php` files for both desktop and mobile versions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper input sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious code into the web page through the guestbook, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the browsers of other users or administrators. This could result in user account compromise, data theft, and potentially server compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through the 'content' field in the guestbook form.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to submit data to the guestbook form. No special privileges or server access are needed. This can be done remotely by anyone able to submit form data to the application."
