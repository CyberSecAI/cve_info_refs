      "cve": "CVE-2018-8932",
      "root_cause": "The MASTERKEY vulnerability bypasses the AMD Platform Security Processor (PSP) signature checks, allowing an attacker to update the PSP with malicious firmware.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient signature verification of PSP firmware updates."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can gain persistent code execution in the PSP, bypassing platform security controls, potentially leading to full system compromise, bypassing Secure Boot, Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV), Windows Credential Guard and other security features implemented on the PSP like fTPM.",

      "impact": "The attacker can gain code execution in the PSP or the SMM (System Management Mode), which are areas not visible to typical security products, allowing for a persistent attack and complete system compromise.  These vulnerabilities can bypass platform security controls, although these changes are not persistent across reboots.",
