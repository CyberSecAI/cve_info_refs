Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-8061:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The HWiNFO AMD64 kernel driver (version 8.98 and lower) allows unprivileged users to send a specific IOCTL (0x85FE2608) that results in a direct physical memory read or write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Direct Physical Memory Access:** The driver allows an IOCTL to read from or write to physical memory directly.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The driver does not properly validate the physical memory address provided by the user.
- **Unprivileged Access:** Unprivileged users can send this special IOCTL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Memory Access:** An attacker can read or write to arbitrary physical memory locations.
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could read sensitive data from physical memory.
- **System Compromise:** An attacker could potentially gain control of the system by manipulating kernel memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An unprivileged user crafts a malicious IOCTL call.
- The user provides a physical address, size, and a virtual address within the input buffer to the IOCTL.
- The driver maps the specified physical address and copies the content to the specified virtual address

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have access to the system as an unprivileged user.
- The attacker must be able to send IOCTLs to the HWiNFO device driver ("HWiNFO32").
- The attacker must know the specific IOCTL number (0x85FE2608) and the format of the input buffer.

**Additional Notes:**
The content clarifies that the `8061.data` file contains the physical address to read from, the size of the data to read, and the destination virtual address to which the read data is copied to.
This vulnerability allows for both read and write capabilities, not just reads as indicated in the initial github description of the CVE.
