The provided content is related to CVE-2018-8949.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the `editAttribute` function within the `Attribute.php` model. Specifically, when editing an attribute, the system was checking for the `uuid` of the attribute. If the `uuid` was present, it would locate the existing attribute based on this `uuid` for modification. However, if the `uuid` was not set in the request, but the `id` of the attribute was specified, the system would bypass the `uuid` check. It was then possible to overwrite an existing attribute by setting the `id` and crafting a request without a `uuid`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper access control: The system allows modification of attributes without proper verification using the `uuid` if only the `id` is supplied.
- Attribute Overwriting: A crafted request could overwrite existing attributes by manipulating the request and including the `id`, but not the `uuid`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data Integrity Loss: Attackers could modify attributes of other events.
- Data Loss: A malicious user could overwrite existing attributes potentially resulting in a loss of original information.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted API Request: An attacker can make a crafted request to the `editAttribute` function by including the `id` of the attribute to be modified, and omitting the `uuid`.
- Attacker Position: An attacker would need to be an authenticated user capable of making API requests to the MISP instance.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated user: The attacker needs to be a user with the ability to edit attributes in the MISP system.
- API Access: The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the MISP API.
