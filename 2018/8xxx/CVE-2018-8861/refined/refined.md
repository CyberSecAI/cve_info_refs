* This could impact system confidentiality, system integrity, or system availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** Exploitation requires local access to the affected system.
*   **Kiosk Breakout:** The attacker must be able to exploit vulnerabilities within the kiosk environment to break out and access the underlying operating system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have local access to the affected CT scanner.
*   They need to have some level of access, either as a limited kiosk user or an unauthorized user, to initiate the breakout attempt.
