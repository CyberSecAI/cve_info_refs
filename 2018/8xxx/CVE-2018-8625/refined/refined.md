  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A reference leak in Microsoft VBScript's VbsErase function when handling arrays, which can be turned into a use-after-free condition.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use-after-free vulnerability due to a reference leak in how VbsErase manages SafeArray objects during array destruction. The function temporarily sets a pointer to null and restores it, but a user-defined callback during SafeArrayDestroyData can modify the VBScript variable, causing the object's reference count to be mishandled.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service condition by overflowing the 32-bit reference counter of built-in objects, leading to memory corruption or unexpected program behavior. It could also be used to potentially achieve remote code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by calling the VbsErase function on a VBScript array. A user-defined callback function, executed during SafeArray destruction, manipulates the reference count of an object.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to execute VBScript code, typically within a browser like Internet Explorer. They need to craft a specific VBScript code with a class that has Class_Terminate event handler that can modify the reference count of a VBScript variable."
