Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2018-8292:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how .NET Core applications handle HTTP redirects. Specifically, when authentication information is manually added to an "Authorization" header of an HTTP request, this information can be inadvertently exposed in an outbound request that encounters an HTTP redirect.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of authentication information (present in the "Authorization" header) during an HTTP redirect.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Compromise of Web Application:**  An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could obtain the exposed authentication information and use it to further compromise the web application. This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Redirects:** The attack vector involves triggering an HTTP redirect after an initial request with the vulnerable "Authorization" header has been made.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be in a position to observe network traffic, or in a position to trigger the vulnerable application to make a request that will be redirected.
- The attacker does not require any specific user interaction and can perform the attack remotely.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability exists in .NET Core runtimes version 1.0.x (prior to 1.0.13), 1.1.x (prior to 1.1.10), and 2.0.x.
- The vulnerability is related to the `System.Net.Http` package. Vulnerable versions are: 2.0.20126.16343, 2.0.20505, 2.0.20710, 4.0.0, 4.1.0, 4.1.1, 4.1.2, 4.3.0, 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.3.3. Secure versions are 4.3.4 or later.
- The vulnerability is resolved by updating .NET Core runtime to versions 1.0.13 and 1.1.10, and migrating .NET Core 2.0 applications to version 2.1 or later.

**Mitigation:**
- System administrators should update to .NET Core runtime versions 1.0.13, 1.1.10 and later.
- Developers are advised to update their .NET Core SDK to versions 1.1.11, and migrate applications using .NET Core 2.0 to a newer version.
