Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis related to the vulnerabilities described in the context of CVE-2018-8933, specifically focusing on the MASTERKEY vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** MASTERKEY

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The AMD Secure Processor (PSP) firmware signature checks can be bypassed, allowing an attacker to update the PSP with malicious firmware. This occurs because the cryptographic checks performed on the firmware update are insufficient or improperly implemented.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Insufficient cryptographic signature verification for PSP firmware updates.
    *   Lack of proper validation of the updated firmware prior to installation.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Code Execution in PSP:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker code execution within the AMD PSP.
    *   **Persistence:** The malicious firmware update persists across operating system reinstalls and potentially even BIOS updates, establishing a persistent foothold.
    *   **Bypass Security Features:** The attacker can bypass platform security controls, including Windows Credential Guard, Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV), Secure Boot, and security features based on the PSP (e.g., fTPM).
    *   **Block/Infect BIOS Updates/Brick Device:**  The ability to modify the PSP firmware can enable attackers to block legitimate BIOS updates, infect future updates, or potentially brick the device.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The primary attack vector involves updating the BIOS with a crafted firmware image that includes the malicious PSP update.
    *   The malicious BIOS update can be performed through the operating system with administrative access.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs administrative access to the target system, meaning they must be able to run an executable with administrator privileges.
    *   The attacker must be able to initiate a BIOS update and reboot the system. No physical access is needed to carry out the attack.

**Summary:**

The MASTERKEY vulnerability allows attackers with administrative privileges to install a malicious firmware on the AMD PSP by bypassing signature checks. This grants them a persistent foothold and the ability to control key security features of the system. The vulnerability poses a serious risk due to its potential for persistence and ability to circumvent various security measures.
