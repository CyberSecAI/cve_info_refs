### WordPress changes and details the WP Activity Log keeps a log of

As a comprehensive and thorough activity log solution for WordPress, WP Activity Log not only tells you that a post, a user profile, or an object was updated, it also lets you know exactly what was changed within the post, the user profile, or the object.

Below is a summary of the changes that the plugin can keep a record of:

* **Post, page and custom post type changes** such as status, [content changes](https://melapress.com/support/kb/wp-activity-log-how-keep-record-of-content-changes/?utm_source=wp+repo&utm_medium=repo+link&utm_campaign=wordpress_org&utm_content=wsal), title, URL, custom field, and other metadata changes
* **Tags and categories changes** such as creating, modifying or deleting them, and adding or removing them from posts
* **Widgets and menus changes** such as creating, modifying, or deleting them
* **User changes** such as user created or registered, deleted, or added to a site on multisite network
* **User profile changes** such as password, email, display name, and role changes
* **User activity** such as login, logout, failed logins, and terminating other sessions
* **WordPress core and settings changes** such as installed updates, permalinks, default role, URL, and other site-wide changes
* **WordPress multisite network changes** such as adding, deleting or archiving sites, adding or removing users from sites etc ([activity logs for multisite networks](https://melapress.com/support/kb/wp-activity-log-multisite-network-features/?utm_source=wp+repo&utm_medium=repo+link&utm_campaign=wordpress_org&utm_content=wsal)).
* **Plugins and Themes changes** such as installing, activating, deactivating, uninstalling, and updating

* Changes on **WooCommerce Stores & products**, **Yoast SEO**, **WPForms**, **Gravity Forms**, **Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)**, **MainWP** and other popular WordPress plugins.

For every event that the plugin records it also reports the:

* Date & time (and milliseconds) of when it happened
* User & role of the user who did the change
* Source IP address from where the change happened
* The object on which the change has taken place

HelloIn the user login report, for some users, instead of the IP address, it writes the following address. What does this address mean instead of the IP address?

I came to use WPAL when I switched my site-management tool to MainWP and discovered there was a WPAL integration. It’s been a great addition to my management workflow and is a godsend when managing dozens of client sites, especially when some of those sites are managed by the clients themselves and can be susceptible to missteps. WPAL makes it easy to narrow down where things went wrong, and which user was responsible.
Recently I discovered that an updated version of WPAL was conflicting with another plugin, causing a fatal error on several of the sites I manage. The WPAL team was very responsive to my forum post, and within a week had issued a patch for my issue as part of a larger WPAL update release. Great support all around.

Very few plugins are worth paying for these days but for any serious or business-oriented WP site this plugin is a must-have for security and peace of mind. Support team is very responsive and helpful as well. Thanks for a solid product and great customer service (both rare things these days).

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
