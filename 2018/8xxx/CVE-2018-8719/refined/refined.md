Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-8719:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided content includes a direct reference to CVE-2018-8719 in the exploit-db.com document. This confirms the relevance of the information to the specified CVE.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of access control on the directories and files generated by the "WP Security Audit Log" plugin. Specifically, log files containing sensitive information, like failed login attempts, are stored in publicly accessible directories under `/wp-content/uploads/wp-security-audit-log/`.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive data due to the lack of proper access control to the log files. These files can contain information such as usernames, IP addresses of failed login attempts, and potentially other user-related information.
*   **Insecure File Storage:** The plugin stores log files in a publicly accessible location under the `/wp-content/uploads/` directory. This location is typically accessible via web browsers without requiring authentication.
*   **Lack of Directory Protection:** The plugin does not implement any access control mechanism (like `.htaccess` rules) to prevent unauthorized access to the created directories containing log files.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** Attackers can access sensitive data, including failed login attempts and potentially other user data contained in the logs. This information can be used for further attacks, such as brute-forcing credentials or targeted attacks against specific users.
*   **Privacy Violation:** The disclosure of failed login attempts and other user-related data can lead to privacy breaches and compromise the confidentiality of user information.
*   **Potential Escalation:** The leaked information can potentially lead to other forms of attacks, as it can be used for reconnaissance and further penetration of the vulnerable website.

**5. Attack vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Access:** Attackers can directly access the log files via web browsers, by browsing to the publicly exposed directories under `/wp-content/uploads/wp-security-audit-log/`.
*   **Google Dorking:** The exploit-db document mentions using "Google Dork" queries to find vulnerable sites, which indicates that search engines can index these vulnerable directories, making them easily discoverable by attackers.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any authentication to access the exposed files; they only need to know or discover the location of these files.
*   **Basic Web Access:** An attacker can be in any location with internet access and a web browser to exploit this vulnerability, provided they know or can find the vulnerable web site.
*   **Information Gathering:** The attacker needs to be able to discover the vulnerable path of the affected WordPress website, through google dorks or other methods.
