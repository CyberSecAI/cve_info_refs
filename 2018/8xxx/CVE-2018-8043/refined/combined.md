# USN-3630-1: Linux kernel vulnerability

23 April 2018

The system could be made to crash under certain conditions.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel
* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2

## Details

It was discovered that the Broadcom UniMAC MDIO bus controller driver in

the Linux kernel did not properly validate device resources. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 17.10

* [linux-image-4.13.0-1017-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2)
  -
  [4.13.0-1017.18](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.13.0-1017.18)
* linux-image-generic
  -
  4.13.0.39.42
* linux-image-generic-lpae
  -
  4.13.0.39.42
* [linux-image-4.13.0-39-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.13.0-39.44](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.13.0-39.44)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-39-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.13.0-39.44](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.13.0-39.44)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-39-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [4.13.0-39.44](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.13.0-39.44)
* linux-image-lowlatency
  -
  4.13.0.39.42
* linux-image-raspi2
  -
  4.13.0.1017.15

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Details

Jann Horn discovered that the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) implementation

in the Linux kernel improperly performed sign extension in some situations.

A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-16995](/security/CVE-2017-16995))

It was discovered that a race condition leading to a use-after-free

vulnerability existed in the ALSA PCM subsystem of the Linux kernel. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-0861](/security/CVE-2017-0861))

It was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel allowed

passthrough of the diagnostic I/O port 0x80. An attacker in a guest VM

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the host OS.

([CVE-2017-1000407](/security/CVE-2017-1000407))

It was discovered that an information disclosure vulnerability existed in

the ACPI implementation of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use

this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory addresses).

([CVE-2017-11472](/security/CVE-2017-11472))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

network namespaces implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-15129](/security/CVE-2017-15129))

It was discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free when handling

device removal. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2017-16528](/security/CVE-2017-16528))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the usbtest device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate endpoint metadata. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2017-16532](/security/CVE-2017-16532))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the Conexant cx231xx USB video capture

driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate interface descriptors.

A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2017-16536](/security/CVE-2017-16536))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the SoundGraph iMON USB driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically

proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2017-16537](/security/CVE-2017-16537))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the IMS Passenger Control Unit USB driver

in the Linux kernel did not properly validate device descriptors. A

physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2017-16645](/security/CVE-2017-16645))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the DiBcom DiB0700 USB DVB driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly handle detach events. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2017-16646](/security/CVE-2017-16646))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the CDC USB Ethernet driver did not

properly validate device descriptors. A physically proximate attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-16649](/security/CVE-2017-16649))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the QMI WWAN USB driver did not properly

validate device descriptors. A physically proximate attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-16650](/security/CVE-2017-16650))

It was discovered that the USB Virtual Host Controller Interface (VHCI)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-3619-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu

14.04 LTS.

Jann Horn discovered that the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) implementation

in the Linux kernel improperly performed sign extension in some situations.

A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-16995](/security/CVE-2017-16995))

It was discovered that a race condition leading to a use-after-free

vulnerability existed in the ALSA PCM subsystem of the Linux kernel. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-0861](/security/CVE-2017-0861))

It was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel allowed

passthrough of the diagnostic I/O port 0x80. An attacker in a guest VM

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the host OS.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# USN-3632-1: Linux kernel (Azure) vulnerabilities

24 April 2018

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-azure](/security/cves?package=linux-azure) - Linux kernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems

## Details

It was discovered that a race condition leading to a use-after-free

vulnerability existed in the ALSA PCM subsystem of the Linux kernel. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-0861](/security/CVE-2017-0861))

It was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel allowed

passthrough of the diagnostic I/O port 0x80. An attacker in a guest VM

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the host OS.

([CVE-2017-1000407](/security/CVE-2017-1000407))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

network namespaces implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-15129](/security/CVE-2017-15129))

It was discovered that the HugeTLB component of the Linux kernel did not

properly handle holes in hugetlb ranges. A local attacker could use this to

expose sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2017-16994](/security/CVE-2017-16994))

It was discovered that the netfilter component of the Linux did not

properly restrict access to the connection tracking helpers list. A local

attacker could use this to bypass intended access restrictions.

([CVE-2017-17448](/security/CVE-2017-17448))

It was discovered that the netfilter passive OS fingerprinting (xt\_osf)

module did not properly perform access control checks. A local attacker

could improperly modify the system-wide OS fingerprint list.

([CVE-2017-17450](/security/CVE-2017-17450))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel

contained an out-of-bounds read when handling memory-mapped I/O. A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2017-17741](/security/CVE-2017-17741))

It was discovered that the Salsa20 encryption algorithm implementations in

the Linux kernel did not properly handle zero-length inputs. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2017-17805](/security/CVE-2017-17805))

It was discovered that the HMAC implementation did not validate the state

of the underlying cryptographic hash algorithm. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-17806](/security/CVE-2017-17806))

It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly check permissions when a key request was performed on a task's

default keyring. A local attacker could use this to add keys to

unauthorized keyrings. ([CVE-2017-17807](/security/CVE-2017-17807))

It was discovered that the Broadcom NetXtremeII ethernet driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate Generic Segment Offload (GSO) packet

sizes. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (interface

unavailability). ([CVE-2018-1000026](/security/CVE-2018-1000026))

It was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Socket (RDS) implementation in

the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write during RDMA page

allocation. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5332](/security/CVE-2018-5332))

Mohamed Ghannam discovered a null pointer dereference in the RDS (Reliable

Datagram Sockets) protocol implementation of the Linux kernel. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-5333](/security/CVE-2018-5333))

èé¾é£ discovered that a race condition existed in loop block device

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-5344](/security/CVE-2018-5344))

It was discovered that the Broadcom UniMAC MDIO bus controller driver in

the Linux kernel did not properly validate device resources. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-8043](/security/CVE-2018-8043))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.13.0-1014-azure](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-azure)
  -
  [4.13.0-1014.17](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-azure/4.13.0-1014.17)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
