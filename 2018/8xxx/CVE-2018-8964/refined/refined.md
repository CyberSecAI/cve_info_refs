The provided content is related to CVE-2018-8964.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is heap-use-after-free vulnerabilities in the `decompile.c` file of the libming library. Specifically, multiple functions within this file are affected, including `decompileGETVARIABLE`, `decompileSingleArgBuiltInFunctionCall`, `decompilePUSHPARAM`, `decompileDELETE`, `decompileSETTARGET`, `decompileSUBSTRING`, `decompileNEWOBJECT`, and `decompileIMPLEMENTS`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Multiple heap-use-after-free vulnerabilities. The issue occurs when the code attempts to access memory that has already been freed, resulting in a crash or other undefined behavior. The vulnerabilities occur in multiple functions when processing specific SWF opcodes during decompilation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation can lead to program crashes and potentially arbitrary code execution. The AddressSanitizer output clearly indicates a "heap-use-after-free" error which can be leveraged for malicious purposes.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves crafting a malicious SWF file containing specific opcodes that trigger the vulnerable functions in `decompile.c`. The vulnerable functions are triggered when the `swftophp` utility is used to decompile this SWF file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to create a malicious SWF file with specific opcodes. The attacker also needs to be able to get the victim to use the vulnerable `swftophp` utility on the crafted file. This implies the attacker may need to deliver or trick a user to open the file locally.
