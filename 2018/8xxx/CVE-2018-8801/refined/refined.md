Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input validation when processing webhook URLs, which allows an attacker to specify arbitrary URLs, including internal addresses, for the webhook to access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application allows a user-controlled URL to be fetched by the server, leading to an SSRF vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information disclosure:** An attacker can scan the internal network and retrieve sensitive information. For example, the attacker can retrieve the list of all servers connected to a Consul cluster using URLs such as `http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/catalog/nodes`
- **Potential destructive actions:** Besides information disclosure, the attacker might also be able to perform destructive actions by accessing internal services if the internal service APIs allow such actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the webhook integration settings in GitLab. An attacker can create a new project, then navigate to the integrations page, and add a malicious URL in the webhook URL field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a GitLab account and be able to create a project. They need to be able to access the project's integration settings.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found on gitlab.com.
- The content includes a specific example of how to trigger the vulnerability, using URLs like `http://127.0.0.1:80/haha.txt` to demonstrate the SSRF. The attacker can use such URLs to probe the internal network.
- The content indicates that internal services such as Consul can also be accessed through this vulnerability.

This information is consistent with a typical SSRF vulnerability.
