Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-8139:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `BoundFunction::NewInstance` method of the Chakra JIT engine in Microsoft Edge. This method handles calls to bound functions. The core issue is that when allocating a new argument array for a bound function call, it incorrectly handles the `CallFlags_ExtraArg` flag. This flag indicates the presence of an additional argument (typically `new.target`).  The method creates an array that's one element smaller than required when `CallFlags_ExtraArg` is set, leading to an out-of-bounds read when the extra argument is accessed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read due to the undersized array allocation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided exploit leads to a denial of service condition, likely due to the out-of-bounds read causing the browser to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **JavaScript:** The vulnerability is triggered through crafted JavaScript code. Specifically, using a bound function with `Reflect.construct`.
*   **Microsoft Edge:** The attack target is Microsoft Edge's Chakra JIT engine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Execution of JavaScript:** The attacker must be able to execute JavaScript code within a vulnerable Microsoft Edge instance. This could be achieved by hosting a malicious page, or by leveraging other vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit is a proof-of-concept (PoC) that demonstrates the vulnerability and can cause a crash, but doesn't seem to include methods for remote code execution.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Google Security Research and reported on Project Zero.
*   The affected function is within the JIT compilation process.
