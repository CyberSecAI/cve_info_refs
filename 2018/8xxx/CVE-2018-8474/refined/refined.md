Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-8474:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Microsoft Lync for Mac 2011 handles embedded iframes within chat messages. Specifically, it does not properly sanitize or validate the `src` attribute of the iframe tag.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** Lync for Mac 2011 fails to properly sanitize or validate the URLs provided in the `src` attribute of an iframe.
- **Forced Browsing:** The application automatically opens a new browser window and navigates to the URL specified in the iframe's `src` attribute, even if the user does not explicitly interact with the link.
- **Forced Download:** When the URL in the iframe's `src` attribute points to a file, Lync for Mac 2011 automatically downloads the file if the file type is among the allowed types (e.g., zip).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Web Browsing:** An attacker can force a victim's default browser to navigate to any website of their choosing, potentially leading to phishing attacks or exploitation of other web vulnerabilities.
- **Arbitrary File Download:** An attacker can force a victim to download arbitrary files, potentially leading to the execution of malware or other malicious content.
- **Denial of Service:** Although not explicitly mentioned, repeated forced browsing/download may lead to a form of denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Chat Message:** An attacker crafts a chat message containing an iframe with a malicious `src` attribute.
- **Targeted User:** The attacker sends this specially crafted message to the victim.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Lync 2013 SDK:** The attacker needs to have the Lync 2013 SDK installed to send messages via Lync programmatically.
- **Access to Lync Network:** The attacker must be able to communicate with the target user through the Lync network (e.g., via chat).
- **Target's Lync Client Running:** The victim needs to have Microsoft Lync for Mac 2011 running.

**Additional Details:**

- **No User Interaction Required:** The vulnerability is triggered automatically upon receipt of the malicious message and doesn't require any user action beyond having the Lync application open.
- **Microsoft's Stance:** Microsoft decided not to fix the vulnerability.
- **Affected Versions:** Lync for Mac 2011 version 14.4.3 and likely earlier versions are vulnerable.
- **Disclosure Timeline:** The issue was reported to Microsoft on 07/18/2017, reproduced on 11/22/2017, and Microsoft's decision not to fix was communicated on 03/07/2018, with a blessing for public disclosure.
