Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-8755:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an authentication/authorization bypass in the Nucom WR644GACV router.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Authentication/Authorization Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is that an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access to the device.
*   **Cleartext Storage of Credentials:**  The router stores system credentials in plaintext and Base64 format within the configuration file, making them easily accessible if the configuration file is obtained.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Full Device Control:** An attacker can gain full control of the vulnerable device.
*   **Credential Theft:**  Attackers can download the device's configuration file and extract the stored credentials.
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can achieve remote access to the device without needing valid credentials, which could lead to further malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Network Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **Internet Exposure:**  If the device is exposed to the internet, the risk of exploitation is higher.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the device via the network.  This could be from the local network or remotely if the device is exposed to the internet.
*   **No Credentials Required:** The attacker does not need valid credentials to exploit the authentication/authorization bypass vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Product:** Nucom WR644GACV Home Gateway / Wireless Dual Band Gigabit VoIP Router
*   **Vulnerable Software Version:** Firmware version <= STA005
*   **Mitigated Software Version:** Firmware version STA006 (latest available version at the time of the report)
*   **CVSS Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
