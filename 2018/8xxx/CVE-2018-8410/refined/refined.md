Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-8410:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in a double dereference issue within the `NtEnumerateKey` system call in Windows 10 version 1803 (and possibly other related functions like `NtEnumerateValueKey`). The kernel incorrectly dereferences an object associated with a predefined registry key twice, leading to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Double Dereference:** The core weakness is the redundant dereferencing of a kernel object within the `NtEnumerateKey` (and similar) system call. Specifically, after a check for `STATUS_INVALID_HANDLE` on predefined keys, the code incorrectly dereferences the object a second time at an exit label.
*   **Use-After-Free Potential:** While initially causing a `REFERENCE_BY_POINTER` bugcheck, the double dereference can potentially be exploited as a Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability. The corrupted object could be used for further operations, modifying freed memory locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact is a kernel crash (bugcheck), leading to a local denial of service.
*   **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** The more severe impact is the potential to escalate privileges. By using the corrupted object to perform actions (like `NtDuplicateObject`), an attacker can modify a freed pool allocation which can result in a Use-After-Free. The freed memory then is used by the kernel leading to an elevation of privilege.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the vulnerable system.
*   **System Call Manipulation:** The attacker must make a specific system call, such as `NtEnumerateKey`, targeting a predefined registry key and then use the resulting handle in other operations like `NtDuplicateObject`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to execute code on the target system.
*   **System Call Access:** The attacker needs to be able to call specific system calls, such as `NtEnumerateKey`, and then perform further actions with the resulting handle before it is closed to trigger the double free.
*   **Windows 10 Version 1803:** The system has to be a vulnerable version of Windows which according to this source is Windows 10 1803.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is specific to Windows 10 version 1803 (and not present in earlier versions).
*   The issue is related to how the kernel handles predefined keys, specifically those used for performance information under `\Registry\Machine\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Perflib`.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) in C# demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability and the potential for a UAF.
* The PoC uses `NtApiDotNet` NuGet package.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Google Security Research.
