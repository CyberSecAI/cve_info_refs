# “AMD Flaws” Technical Summary

Two weeks ago, we were engaged by [CTS Labs](http://www.cts-labs.com) as independent consultants at our standard consulting rates to review and confirm the technical accuracy of their preliminary findings. We participated neither in their research nor in their subsequent disclosure process. Our recommendation to CTS was to disclose the vulnerabilities through a CERT.

Our review of the vulnerabilities was based on documentation and proof-of-concept code provided by CTS. We confirmed that the proof-of-concept code worked as described on the hardware we tested, but we will defer to AMD for a final determination of their full impact, patches, and remediation recommendations.

> So this <https://t.co/vYktqat10K> business… CTS Labs asked us to review their research last week, and sent us a full technical report with PoC exploit code for each set of bugs.

Most of the discussion after the public announcement of the vulnerabilities has been focused on the way they were disclosed rather than their technical impact. In this post, we have tried to extract the relevant technical details from the [CTS whitepaper](https://safefirmware.com/amdflaws_whitepaper.pdf) so they can be of use to the security community without the distraction of the surrounding disclosure issues.

## Technical Summary

The security architecture of modern computer systems is based on a defense in depth. Security features like [Windows Credential Guard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard), TPMs, and virtualization can be used to prevent access to sensitive data from even an administrator or root.

The AMD Platform Security Processor (PSP) is a security coprocessor that resides inside AMD CPUs and is implemented as a separate ARM CPU. It is similar to Intel ME or the [Apple Secure Enclave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UNeUT_sRos). It runs applications that provide security features like the TPM or Secure Encrypted Virtualization. The PSP has privileged access to the lowest level of the computer system.

The PSP firmware can be updated through a BIOS update, but it must be cryptographically signed by AMD. Physical access is usually not required to update the BIOS and this can be done with administrator access to the computer. The MASTERKEY vulnerability bypasses the PSP signature checks to update the PSP with the attacker’s firmware. Cfir Cohen on the Google Cloud Security Team discovered a [similar issue](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2018/Jan/12) in an adjacent area of the AMD PSP in September 2017.

The PSP also exposes an API to the host computer. The FALLOUT and RYZENFALL vulnerabilities exploit the PSP APIs to gain code execution in the PSP or the SMM.

The “chipset” is a component on the motherboard used to broker communication between the processor, memory, and peripherals. The chipset has full access to the system memory and devices. The CHIMERA vulnerability abuses exposed interfaces of the AMD Promontory chipset to gain code execution in the chipset processor.

**Exploitation requirements**

* All exploits require the ability to run an executable as admin (no physical access is required)
* MASTERKEY additionally requires issuing a BIOS update + reboot

**Potential technical impact**

* Code execution in the PSP and SMM (no visibility to typical security products)
* Persistence across OS reinstallation and BIOS updates
* Block or infect further BIOS updates, or brick the device
* Bypass Windows Credential Guard
* Bypass Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV)
* Bypass Secure Boot
* Bypass or attack security features implemented on top of the PSP (e.g., fTPM)

There is no immediate risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities for most users. Even if the full details were published today, attackers would need to invest significant development efforts to build attack tools that utilize these vulnerabilities. This level of effort is beyond the reach of most attackers (see <https://www.usenix.org/system/files/1401_08-12_mickens.pdf>, Figure 1)

These types of vulnerabilities should not surprise any security researchers; similar flaws have been found in other embedded systems that have attempted to implement security features. They are the result of simple programming flaws, unclear security boundaries, and insufficient security testing. In contrast, the recent [Meltdown and Spectre](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2018/01/30/an-accessible-overview-of-meltdown-and-spectre-part-1/) flaws required previously unknown techniques and novel research advances to discover and exploit.

   Can the attacks against memory encryption be leveraged from within a VM? Some of the PSP MIMO registers at least are available to guests.

     Why should a guest have direct access to the PSP MMIO ranges? IMHO the Hypervisor would have explicitly configure the nested page tables to grant access to those ranges to a guest.

   Fortunately it seems that most of these can be fixed with a microcode / bios update, even possibly for CHIMERA. If you’re paranoid, then replacing the motherboard is not too expensive either.

‎03-21-2018
07:07 AM

On March 12, 2018, AMD received a communication from CTS Labs regarding research into security vulnerabilities involving some AMD products. Less than 24 hours later, the research firm went public with its findings. Security and protecting users’ data is of the utmost importance to us at AMD and we have worked rapidly to assess this security research and develop mitigation plans where needed. This is our first public update on this research, and will cover both our technical assessment of the issues as well as planned mitigation actions.

The security issues identified by the third-party researchers are not related to the AMD “Zen” CPU architecture or the Google Project Zero exploits made public Jan. 3, 2018. Instead, these issues are associated with the firmware managing the embedded security control processor in some of our products (AMD Secure Processor) and the chipset used in some socket AM4 and socket TR4 desktop platforms supporting AMD processors.

As described in more detail below, AMD has rapidly completed its assessment and is in the process of developing and staging the deployment of mitigations. It’s important to note that all the issues raised in the research require administrative access to the system, a type of access that effectively grants the user unrestricted access to the system and the right to delete, create or modify any of the folders or files on the computer, as well as change any settings. Any attacker gaining unauthorized administrative access would have a wide range of attacks at their disposal well beyond the exploits identified in this research. Further, all modern operating systems and enterprise-quality hypervisors today have many effective security controls, such as Microsoft Windows Credential Guard in the Windows environment, in place to prevent unauthorized administrative access that would need to be overcome in order to affect these security issues. A useful clarification of the difficulties associated with successfully exploiting these issues can be found in this [posting from Trail of Bits](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2018/03/15/amd-flaws-technical-summary/), an independent security research firm who were contracted by the third-party researchers to verify their findings.

The security issues identified can be grouped into three major categories. The table below describes the categories, the AMD assessment of impact, and planned actions.

| **Vulnerability Groups** | **Problem Description & Method of Exploitation** | **Potential Impact** | **Planned AMD Mitigation** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **MASTERKEY**  **and**  **PSP Privilege Escalation**  **(AMD Secure Processor or “PSP” firmware)** | Issue: Attacker who already has compromised the security of a system updates flash to corrupt its contents. AMD Secure Processor (PSP) checks do not detect the corruption.    Method: Attacker requires Administrative access | Attacker can circumvent platform security controls. These changes are persistent following a system reboot. | **Firmware patch release through BIOS update. No performance impact is expected.**    **AMD is working on PSP firmware updates that we plan to release in the coming weeks.** |
| **RYZENFALL and FALLOUT**    **(AMD Secure Processor firmware)** | Issue: Attacker who already has compromised the security of a system writes to AMD Secure Processor registers to exploit vulnerabilities in the interface between x86 and AMD Secure Processor (PSP).    Method: Attacker requires Administrative access. | Attacker can circumvent platform security controls but is not persistent across reboots.    Attacker may install difficult to detect malware in SMM (x86). | **Firmware patch release through BIOS update. No performance impact is expected.**    **AMD is working on PSP firmware updates that we plan to release in the coming weeks.** |
| “Promontory” Chipset |  |  |  |
| **CHIMERA**  “Promontory” chipset used in many socket AM4 desktop and socket TR4 high-end desktop (HEDT) platforms.  AMD EPYC server platforms, EPYC and Ryzen Embedded platforms, and AMD Ryzen Mobile FP5 platforms do not use the “Promontory” chipset. | Issue: Attacker who already has compromised the security of a system installs a malicious driver that exposes certain Promontory functions.    Method: Attacker requires Administrative access. | Attacker accesses physical memory through the chipset.    Attacker installs difficult to detect malware in the chipset but is not persistent across reboots. | **Mitigating patches released through BIOS update. No performance impact is expected.**    **AMD is working with the third-party provider that designed and manufactured the “Promontory” chipset on appropriate mitigations.** |

AMD will provide additional updates on both our analysis of these issues and the related mitigation plans in the coming weeks.

*​Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer*
