The provided content relates to CVE-2018-8937.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application's source code allows it to accept untrusted input, specifically a `redirect_url` parameter, which can cause the web application to redirect the request to a URL contained within this untrusted input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Open Redirect:** The application redirects to a URL provided in the `redirect_url` parameter without proper validation, allowing an attacker to redirect users to an arbitrary website.
*  **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS via a crafted src attribute of an IMG element within a URI.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Open Redirect:** An attacker can use the open redirect vulnerability to launch phishing attacks by redirecting users to malicious websites and stealing their credentials.
*   **Reflected XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a user's browser session and perform actions as the user or steal session data.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Open Redirect:** The attacker manipulates the `redirect_url` parameter in the URL.
*   **Reflected XSS:** The attacker crafts a URL containing malicious JavaScript within a `src` attribute of an `img` tag, which is then reflected in the application's response.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
*   The attacker needs to entice a user to click on this malicious URL.
