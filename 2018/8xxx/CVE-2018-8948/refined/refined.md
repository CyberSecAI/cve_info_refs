The content is related to CVE-2018-8948.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled data within the `resolved_attributes.ctp` view of the MISP application, which potentially allows for XSS if a malicious MISP module is loaded on the instance.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of proper output encoding of user-controlled data. Specifically, the code was directly outputting data in several locations, including:
    - the `option` values in the `select` element for the attribute type
    - the `option` values in the `select` element for the sharing group
    - the `placeholder` attribute of the comment field input element
    - the `value` attribute of the comment field input element
    - the `value` attribute of the tag input element
    - the `option` values in the dropdown.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the page by crafting a malicious MISP module that includes specially crafted data.
- This injected code could potentially be executed in the context of a user's browser when they view the resolved attributes.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious MISP module is loaded onto the instance.
- This module would inject malicious code/data into the fields that are vulnerable to XSS.
- When an authorized user views the resolved attributes using the vulnerable view, the malicious code is executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to load a malicious module on the instance.
- The attacker does not necessarily need direct access to the web UI, but can achieve the attack by crafting the module.
