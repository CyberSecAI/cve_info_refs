Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data:** The N'Vision 8840 Physician Programmer and its removable compact flash application card (8870) store Personal Health Information (PHI) and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) unencrypted.
*   **Protection Mechanism Failure:** The 8840 programmer executes code from the 8870 application card. The card's contents, including binary executables, can be modified to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data:** PHI and PII are stored unencrypted on the application card.
*   **CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure:** The programmer does not adequately verify the integrity or legitimacy of the code on the application card.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to PHI/PII:** An attacker with physical access to the application card can access unencrypted patient data, including sensitive health information and personally identifiable information.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker with physical access to the application card and sufficient technical capability can modify the card to execute malicious code on the programmer. This could potentially lead to the compromise of the device's functionality and data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** The primary attack vector is physical access to the N'Vision 8840 Physician Programmer or its removable 8870 application card.
*   **Card Modification:** An attacker must have the technical capability to modify the application card.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the programmer or the application card.
*   **Technical Expertise:** To modify the card and execute arbitrary code, the attacker needs a certain level of technical proficiency.
*   **Clinical Setting:** The attacker needs to be able to access the device in the clinical setting where it is used.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The device is not networked and has no Wi-Fi, USB, or Bluetooth capabilities, preventing remote exploitation.
*   The devices are not sold commercially but are loaned to healthcare professionals.
*   Medtronic has not developed a product update but has reinforced security practices in the bulletin.
*   The advisory is also related to CVE-2018-10631, which is specifically related to the arbitrary code execution vulnerability via the application card.
