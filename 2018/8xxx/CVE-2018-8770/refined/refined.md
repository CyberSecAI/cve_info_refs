Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-8770

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the exposure of the physical path of the web application through various PHP files. This occurs due to the application's configuration or coding practices that lead to the full server-side file paths being revealed in error messages or responses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Physical Path Leakage:** The application leaks the absolute paths of files within its directory structure. This is a common vulnerability that exposes internal system information.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The leaked paths reveal potentially sensitive information about the application's structure, including directory names and file names.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Gathering:** An attacker can use the leaked paths to understand the application's structure, locate configuration files, and identify other potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Increased Attack Surface:** The knowledge of the physical paths makes it easier to target specific files for further exploitation such as local file inclusion.
*   **Potential for Further Compromise:**  In some cases, the leaked paths might also reveal the locations of sensitive configuration files or credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability can be triggered by simply accessing the vulnerable URLs using a web browser or other HTTP client.
*   **Error Messages/Responses:**  The paths are revealed in the response content of the server, particularly when the targeted scripts are accessed directly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** An attacker only needs network access to the web application.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to make basic HTTP requests.

**Technical Details:**

The following URLs were identified as leaking the physical paths:

```
http://localhost/tests/generate.php
http://localhost/tests/controllers/getConfigTest.php
http://localhost/tests/controllers/getUpdateTest.php
http://localhost/tests/controllers/postclientdataTest.php
http://localhost/tests/controllers/posterrorTest.php
http://localhost/tests/controllers/posteventTest.php
http://localhost/tests/controllers/posttagTest.php
http://localhost/tests/controllers/postusinglogTest.php
http://localhost/tests/fixtures/Controller_fixt.php
http://localhost/tests/fixtures/Controller_fixt2.php
http://localhost/tests/fixtures/view_fixt2.php
http://localhost/tests/libs/ipTest.php
http://localhost/tests/models/commonDbfix.php
```

The content from `exploit-db.com` confirms the vulnerability and provides the same list of vulnerable URLs as a proof-of-concept (PoC).

The github content shows the source code repository for the vulnerable software.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a simple case of physical path leakage, which is not a high-severity issue in itself, but it provides valuable information to attackers that can be leveraged to exploit other potential vulnerabilities.
