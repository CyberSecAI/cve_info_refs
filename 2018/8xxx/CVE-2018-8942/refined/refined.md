{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Xiuno BBS 4.0.0 software has insufficient input sanitization in the \"Site Name\" setting located in the admin panel. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they view the vulnerable page. This could lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a user inputs a malicious XSS payload in the \"Site Name\" field, then the page that displays this setting is accessed by a victim. Specifically, the payload `\"><svg/onload=alert(0)>` was used to demonstrate the vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the administrative panel and the \"Site Name\" setting. They also need to be authenticated to be able to change this setting."
