Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the security issues related to CVE-2018-1000082 and the others mentioned:

**CVE-2018-1000082 is related to the Security Misconfiguration**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient access controls, allowing unauthorized users to download application plugins.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper authentication and authorization checks for plugin download requests.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can download plugins, potentially including those with known vulnerabilities, to compromise the server. This could lead to arbitrary code execution, data theft, or other malicious activities.
*  **Attack Vector:** A non-admin user can make a request to download plugins.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be a user on the system, but does not need administrator privileges.

**Other Vulnerabilities Described:**

*   **CSRF with RCE (Remote Code Execution):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of CSRF protection in the `/api/terminal/create` endpoint.
    *   **Weakness:** The application doesn't properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can trick an authenticated admin user into executing arbitrary commands on the server.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker crafts a malicious HTML page that, when visited by an authenticated user, sends the command to the server.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Requires an authenticated user to visit a malicious site controlled by the attacker.

*   **Improper Error Handling:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Malformed JSON in login requests causes the server to return a traceback including server paths.
    *   **Weakness:** The server leaks potentially sensitive information due to verbose error messages.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can gain knowledge of the server's filesystem structure.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Send a malformed JSON object in a login request.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** No special privileges needed.

*   **Denial of Service:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of input validation on the sensor name leads to a denial of service.
    *   **Weakness:** The server is vulnerable to being overwhelmed when processing an overly large sensor name.
    *   **Impact:** The server becomes unresponsive.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Send a very large string as the sensor name.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** No special privileges needed.

*   **Information Disclosure:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The login page source code includes sensitive configuration information.
    *   **Weakness:** The application embeds configuration information in the client-side code.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can obtain system information, such as the OS version, and the superuser's username.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Viewing the page source.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** No special privileges needed.
