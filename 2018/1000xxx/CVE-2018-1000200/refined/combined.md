| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1568744#c0)  Adam Mariš    2018-04-18 08:29:27 UTC  ``` It was found that out of memory (oom) killing a process that has large spans of mlocked memory can result in deferencing a NULL pointer, leading to denial of service.  The issue arises from an oom killed process's final thread calling exit_mmap(), which calls munlock_vma_pages_all() for mlocked vmas.  This can happen synchronously with the oom reaper's unmap_page_range() since the vma's VM_LOCKED bit is cleared before munlocking (to determine if any other vmas share the memory and are mlocked).

mm, oom: fix concurrent munlock and oom reaper unmap, v3Since exit\_mmap() is done without the protection of mm->mmap\_sem, it is
possible for the oom reaper to concurrently operate on an mm until
MMF\_OOM\_SKIP is set.
This allows munlock\_vma\_pages\_all() to concurrently run while the oom
reaper is operating on a vma. Since munlock\_vma\_pages\_range() depends
on clearing VM\_LOCKED from vm\_flags before actually doing the munlock to
determine if any other vmas are locking the same memory, the check for
VM\_LOCKED in the oom reaper is racy.
This is especially noticeable on architectures such as powerpc where
clearing a huge pmd requires serialize\_against\_pte\_lookup(). If the pmd
is zapped by the oom reaper during follow\_page\_mask() after the check
for pmd\_none() is bypassed, this ends up deferencing a NULL ptl or a
kernel oops.
Fix this by manually freeing all possible memory from the mm before
doing the munlock and then setting MMF\_OOM\_SKIP. The oom reaper can not
run on the mm anymore so the munlock is safe to do in exit\_mmap(). It
also matches the logic that the oom reaper currently uses for
determining when to set MMF\_OOM\_SKIP itself, so there's no new risk of
excessive oom killing.
This issue fixes CVE-2018-1000200.

## Details

It was discovered that, when attempting to handle an out-of-memory

situation, a null pointer dereference could be triggered in the Linux

kernel in some circumstances. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-1000200](/security/CVE-2018-1000200))

Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate meta-data information. An attacker could

use this to construct a malicious xfs image that, when mounted, could cause

a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-10323](/security/CVE-2018-10323))

Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate xattr information. An attacker could use

this to construct a malicious xfs image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10840](/security/CVE-2018-10840))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly keep meta-data information consistent in some

situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-10881](/security/CVE-2018-10881))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle corrupted meta data in some situations. An

attacker could use this to specially craft an ext4 filesystem that caused a

denial of service (system crash) when mounted. ([CVE-2018-1093](/security/CVE-2018-1093))

Jann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel's implementation of random seed

data reported that it was in a ready state before it had gathered

sufficient entropy. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information. ([CVE-2018-1108](/security/CVE-2018-1108))

It was discovered that the procfs filesystem did not properly handle

processes mapping some memory elements onto files. A local attacker could

use this to block utilities that examine the procfs filesystem to report

operating system state, such as ps(1). ([CVE-2018-1120](/security/CVE-2018-1120))

Jann Horn discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly keep xattr information consistent in some

situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-11412](/security/CVE-2018-11412))

Piotr Gabriel Kosinski and Daniel Shapira discovered a stack-based buffer

overflow in the CDROM driver implementation of the Linux kernel. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-11506](/security/CVE-2018-11506))

Shankara Pailoor discovered that a race condition existed in the socket

handling code in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause

a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-12232](/security/CVE-2018-12232))

Shankara Pailoor discovered that the JFS filesystem implementation in the

Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow when handling extended attributes.

A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-12233](/security/CVE-2018-12233))

Felix Wilhelm discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel

did not properly perform permission checks in some situations when nested

virtualization is used. An attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this

to escape into an outer VM or the host OS. ([CVE-2018-12904](/security/CVE-2018-12904))

Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle an error condition with a corrupted xfs

image. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious xfs image that,

when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-13094](/security/CVE-2018-13094))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly handle setgid file

creation when performed by a non-member of the group. A local attacker

could use this to gain elevated privileges. ([CVE-2018-13405](/security/CVE-2018-13405))

Silvio Cesare discovered that the generic VESA frame buffer driver in the

Linux kernel contained an integer overflow. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-13406](/security/CVE-2018-13406))

Jakub Jirasek discovered that multiple use-after-free errors existed in the

USB/IP implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-5814](/security/CVE-2018-5814))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ARM Advanced

Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) driver in the Linux kernel that

could result in a double free. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-9415](/security/CVE-2018-9415))

It was discovered that an information leak existed in the generic SCSI

driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-1000204](/security/CVE-2018-1000204))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

##### Ubuntu 16.04

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux-hwe](/security/cves?package=linux-hwe) - Linux hardware enablement (HWE) kernel

## Details

USN-3752-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 18.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS for Ubuntu

16.04 LTS.

It was discovered that, when attempting to handle an out-of-memory

situation, a null pointer dereference could be triggered in the Linux

kernel in some circumstances. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-1000200](/security/CVE-2018-1000200))

Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate meta-data information. An attacker could

use this to construct a malicious xfs image that, when mounted, could cause

a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-10323](/security/CVE-2018-10323))

Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate xattr information. An attacker could use

this to construct a malicious xfs image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10840](/security/CVE-2018-10840))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly keep meta-data information consistent in some

situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-10881](/security/CVE-2018-10881))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle corrupted meta data in some situations. An

attacker could use this to specially craft an ext4 filesystem that caused a

denial of service (system crash) when mounted. ([CVE-2018-1093](/security/CVE-2018-1093))

Jann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel's implementation of random seed

data reported that it was in a ready state before it had gathered

sufficient entropy. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information. ([CVE-2018-1108](/security/CVE-2018-1108))

It was discovered that the procfs filesystem did not properly handle

processes mapping some memory elements onto files. A local attacker could

use this to block utilities that examine the procfs filesystem to report

operating system state, such as ps(1). ([CVE-2018-1120](/security/CVE-2018-1120))

Jann Horn discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly keep xattr information consistent in some

situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-11412](/security/CVE-2018-11412))

Piotr Gabriel Kosinski and Daniel Shapira discovered a stack-based buffer

overflow in the CDROM driver implementation of the Linux kernel. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-11506](/security/CVE-2018-11506))

Shankara Pailoor discovered that a race condition existed in the socket

handling code in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause

a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-12232](/security/CVE-2018-12232))

Shankara Pailoor discovered that the JFS filesystem implementation in the

Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow when handling extended attributes.

A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-12233](/security/CVE-2018-12233))

Felix Wilhelm discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel

did not properly perform permission checks in some situations when nested

virtualization is used. An attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this

to escape into an outer VM or the host OS. ([CVE-2018-12904](/security/CVE-2018-12904))

Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle an error condition with a corrupted xfs

image. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious xfs image that,

when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-13094](/security/CVE-2018-13094))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly handle setgid file

creation when performed by a non-member of the group. A local attacker

could use this to gain elevated privileges. ([CVE-2018-13405](/security/CVE-2018-13405))

Silvio Cesare discovered that the generic VESA frame buffer driver in the

Linux kernel contained an integer overflow. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-13406](/security/CVE-2018-13406))

Jakub Jirasek discovered that multiple use-after-free errors existed in the

USB/IP implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-5814](/security/CVE-2018-5814))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ARM Advanced

Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) driver in the Linux kernel that

could result in a double free. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-9415](/security/CVE-2018-9415))

It was discovered that an information leak existed in the generic SCSI

driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-1000204](/security/CVE-2018-1000204))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-33-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-33-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.15.0-33-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.15.0-33.36~16.04.1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Details

It was discovered that, when attempting to handle an out-of-memory

situation, a null pointer dereference could be triggered in the Linux

kernel in some circumstances. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-1000200](/security/CVE-2018-1000200))

Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate meta-data information. An attacker could

use this to construct a malicious xfs image that, when mounted, could cause

a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-10323](/security/CVE-2018-10323))

Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate xattr information. An attacker could use

this to construct a malicious xfs image that, when mounted, could cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-10840](/security/CVE-2018-10840))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly keep meta-data information consistent in some

situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-10881](/security/CVE-2018-10881))

Wen Xu discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle corrupted meta data in some situations. An

attacker could use this to specially craft an ext4 filesystem that caused a

denial of service (system crash) when mounted. ([CVE-2018-1093](/security/CVE-2018-1093))

Jann Horn discovered that the Linux kernel's implementation of random seed

data reported that it was in a ready state before it had gathered

sufficient entropy. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive

information. ([CVE-2018-1108](/security/CVE-2018-1108))

It was discovered that the procfs filesystem did not properly handle

processes mapping some memory elements onto files. A local attacker could

use this to block utilities that examine the procfs filesystem to report

operating system state, such as ps(1). ([CVE-2018-1120](/security/CVE-2018-1120))

Jann Horn discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly keep xattr information consistent in some

situations. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image

that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-11412](/security/CVE-2018-11412))

Piotr Gabriel Kosinski and Daniel Shapira discovered a stack-based buffer

overflow in the CDROM driver implementation of the Linux kernel. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-11506](/security/CVE-2018-11506))

Shankara Pailoor discovered that a race condition existed in the socket

handling code in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause

a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-12232](/security/CVE-2018-12232))

Shankara Pailoor discovered that the JFS filesystem implementation in the

Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow when handling extended attributes.

A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-12233](/security/CVE-2018-12233))

Felix Wilhelm discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel

did not properly perform permission checks in some situations when nested

virtualization is used. An attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this

to escape into an outer VM or the host OS. ([CVE-2018-12904](/security/CVE-2018-12904))

Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle an error condition with a corrupted xfs

image. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious xfs image that,

when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-13094](/security/CVE-2018-13094))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly handle setgid file

creation when performed by a non-member of the group. A local attacker

could use this to gain elevated privileges. ([CVE-2018-13405](/security/CVE-2018-13405))

Silvio Cesare discovered that the generic VESA frame buffer driver in the

Linux kernel contained an integer overflow. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-13406](/security/CVE-2018-13406))

Jakub Jirasek discovered that multiple use-after-free errors existed in the

USB/IP implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-5814](/security/CVE-2018-5814))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ARM Advanced

Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) driver in the Linux kernel that

could result in a double free. A local attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-9415](/security/CVE-2018-9415))

It was discovered that an information leak existed in the generic SCSI

driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2018-1000204](/security/CVE-2018-1000204))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

  -
  [4.15.0-33.36](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/4.15.0-33.36)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory read from address to which a recent memory write has occurred may see an older value and subsequently cause an update into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2019-03-05 14:08:14 UTC | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1566890#c0)  Prasad Pandit    2018-04-13 07:14:17 UTC  ``` An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of Load & Store instructions (a commonly used performance optimization).  It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory read from address to which a recent memory write has occurred may see an older value and subsequently cause an update into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire).  As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1566890#c8)  Petr Matousek    2018-05-16 15:10:22 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Product Security is aware of this issue.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Topic

An update for kernel-alt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-alt packages provide the Linux kernel version 4.x.

Security Fix(es):

* An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of Load & Store instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory read from address to which a recent memory write has occurred may see an older value and subsequently cause an update into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3639, aarch64)
* A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port, thus the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2018-5390)
* A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithm by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2018-5391)

Space precludes documenting all of the security fixes in this advisory. See the descriptions of the remaining security fixes in the related Knowledge Article:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/3658021>

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Ken Johnson (Microsoft Security Response Center) and Jann Horn (Google Project Zero) for reporting CVE-2018-3639; Juha-Matti Tilli (Aalto University - Department of Communications and Networking and Nokia Bell Labs) for reporting CVE-2018-5390 and CVE-2018-5391; Qualys Research Labs for reporting CVE-2018-1120; David Rientjes (Google) for reporting CVE-2018-1000200; and Wen Xu for reporting CVE-2018-1092, CVE-2018-1094, and CVE-2018-1095. The CVE-2018-14619 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer (Red Hat) and Ondrej Mosnacek (Red Hat).

Additional Changes:

[Download RAW [message](?l=linux-kernel&m=152400522806945&q=mbox) or [body](?l=linux-kernel&m=152400522806945&q=raw)]

Since exit_mmap() is done without the protection of mm->mmap_sem, it is
possible for the oom reaper to concurrently operate on an mm until
MMF_OOM_SKIP is set.

This allows munlock_vma_pages_all() to concurrently run while the oom
reaper is operating on a vma.  Since munlock_vma_pages_range() depends on
clearing VM_LOCKED from vm_flags before actually doing the munlock to
determine if any other vmas are locking the same memory, the check for
VM_LOCKED in the oom reaper is racy.

This is especially noticeable on architectures such as powerpc where
clearing a huge pmd requires kick_all_cpus_sync().  If the pmd is zapped
by the oom reaper during follow_page_mask() after the check for pmd_none()
is bypassed, this ends up deferencing a NULL ptl.

Fix this by reusing MMF_UNSTABLE to specify that an mm should not be
reaped.  This prevents the concurrent munlock_vma_pages_range() and
unmap_page_range().  The oom reaper will simply not operate on an mm that
has the bit set and leave the unmapping to exit_mmap().

Fixes: 212925802454 ("mm: oom: let oom_reap_task and exit_mmap run concurrently")

# CVE-2018-1000200 (Linux): Bad memory access on oom kill of large mlocked process

---

*From*: David Rientjes <rientjes () google com>

Hi all,

Out of memory (oom) killing a process that has large spans of mlocked
memory can result in a bad memory access or a NULL pointer dereference due
to concurrent memory unmapping by the oom reaper kernel thread.

This affects Linux 4.14, 4.15, and 4.16.

It is much more likely on PowerPC where clearing a huge pmd results in
serialize_against_pte_lookup(), which forces all cpus out of idle.  All
architectures are vulnerable, however.

An example dereference:

Unable to handle kernel paging request for data at address 0x00000018
Faulting instruction address: 0xc000000000167ac0
Oops: Kernel access of bad area, sig: 11 [#1]
SMP NR_CPUS=256 NUMA PowerNV
NIP __lock_acquire
LR lock_acquire
Call Trace:
lock_acquire
_raw_spin_lock
follow_page_pte
munlock_vma_pages_range
exit_mmap
mmput
do_exit
do_group_exit
get_signal
do_signal
do_notify_resume

The issue arises from an oom killed process's final thread calling
exit_mmap(), which calls munlock_vma_pages_all() for mlocked vmas.  This
can happen synchronously with the oom reaper's unmap_page_range() since
the vma's VM_LOCKED bit is cleared before munlocking (to determine if any
other vmas share the memory and are mlocked).

The simple exploit is provided inline, below.  The amount of memory to be
mlocked, MEM_LENGTH, must be large enough to trigger an oom kill.  There
are two common ways to do that: (1) MEM_LENGTH exceeds all memory on the
system, or (2) the exploit is attached to a memory control group (cgroup)
that is limited to less than MEM_LENGTH.  Note that this has only been
reproduced on PowerPC so far, due to the pmd clearing mentioned above but
all platforms should be equally as vulnerable since the oom reaper kernel
thread can race with munlock.

The proposed fix is <https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=152460926619256>.
(Please note that key maintainers are currently at a conference, so review
and merge may be delayed longer than normal.)

Thanks for your time.

#include <sys/mman.h>

#define MEM_LENGTH      (1UL << 30)

int main(void)
{
        void *ptr = mmap(0, MEM_LENGTH, PROT_WRITE,
                MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS, 0, 0);
        if (ptr == MAP_FAILED)
                return -1;

        return mlock(ptr, MEM_LENGTH);
}

```

Since exit_mmap() is done without the protection of mm->mmap_sem, it is
possible for the oom reaper to concurrently operate on an mm until
MMF_OOM_SKIP is set.

This allows munlock_vma_pages_all() to concurrently run while the oom
reaper is operating on a vma.  Since munlock_vma_pages_range() depends on
clearing VM_LOCKED from vm_flags before actually doing the munlock to
determine if any other vmas are locking the same memory, the check for
VM_LOCKED in the oom reaper is racy.

This is especially noticeable on architectures such as powerpc where
clearing a huge pmd requires serialize_against_pte_lookup().  If the pmd
is zapped by the oom reaper during follow_page_mask() after the check for
pmd_none() is bypassed, this ends up deferencing a NULL ptl or a kernel
oops.

Fix this by manually freeing all possible memory from the mm before doing
the munlock and then setting MMF_OOM_SKIP.  The oom reaper can not run on
the mm anymore so the munlock is safe to do in exit_mmap().  It also
matches the logic that the oom reaper currently uses for determining when
to set MMF_OOM_SKIP itself, so there's no new risk of excessive oom
killing.

This issue fixes CVE-2018-1000200.
