  "CVE-2018-1000200": {
    "description": "The Linux kernel has a vulnerability where out-of-memory (OOM) killing a process with large mlocked memory spans can result in dereferencing a NULL pointer, leading to a denial of service.",
    "root_cause": "A race condition exists between the OOM killer's unmap_page_range() function and the process's exit_mmap() function, specifically within the munlock_vma_pages_all() function. The VM_LOCKED bit of the vma is cleared before the munlock, creating a race where the OOM reaper might access freed memory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race Condition",
      "NULL Pointer Dereference",
	  "Concurrent memory unmapping"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (system crash) due to a NULL pointer dereference.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local attacker can trigger OOM kill on process with large mlocked memory spans."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Local user can allocate memory and lock it using mlock, triggering the out-of-memory condition on the system or a memory cgroup with limited memory",
	"additional_details":"This issue is more prominent on architectures like PowerPC due to additional synchronization requirements during pmd clearing, but all architectures are vulnerable due to the race condition between exit_mmap and the oom reaper."
