Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000836:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure parsing of XML input within the `IscheduleClient.java` file of the BW Calendar Engine. Specifically, the application processes XML data using a weakly configured XML parser that doesn't prevent external entity expansion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The core vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization or configuration of the XML parser. It allows the inclusion of external entities in the processed XML data. This vulnerability is present in `org/bedework/calsvc/scheduling/hosts/IscheduleClient.java`, specifically at line 422.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this XXE vulnerability can lead to several impacts:
  - **Disclosure of confidential data:** Attackers could potentially access sensitive information from the server's file system.
  - **Denial of service (DoS):** By exploiting XML parsing, attackers can craft payloads that could cause excessive resource consumption, leading to denial of service.
  - **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** An attacker can force the server to make requests to other internal or external systems, acting as a proxy.
  - **Port scanning:** An attacker could use the vulnerable server to scan the local network, discovering other systems and services.
  - **Other system impacts:** The vulnerability might be used to cause other unforeseen issues depending on the system and environment configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious XML Input:** The attacker crafts malicious XML content that contains references to external entities.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack (implied):** Although not explicitly stated in the provided text, the issue is mentioned as "XXE via MitM / Malicious Server," implying that the attacker could potentially intercept network traffic to inject malicious XML data. This is because the vulnerable code is a client (`IscheduleClient`) that fetches data from a server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide malicious XML:** The attacker needs to be able to inject XML data into the application which will be parsed by the vulnerable `IscheduleClient`. This could involve intercepting traffic (MitM), compromising the server the client fetches XML from, or directly providing the XML if the application accepts this as an input.
- **Network proximity (potentially):** To perform a MitM attack, the attacker needs to be positioned within the network path between the client and server or compromise the server the client is talking to.

The content provided is more detailed than the standard CVE description because it pinpoints the exact vulnerable code location and the associated risks including SSRF and port scanning in addition to information disclosure and DoS.
