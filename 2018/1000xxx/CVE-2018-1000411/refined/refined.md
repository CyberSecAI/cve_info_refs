Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000411:

**CVE-2018-1000411**

*   **Root Cause:** The JUnit Plugin had a URL endpoint that allowed setting the description of a test object without requiring a POST request.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): The vulnerability stemmed from the lack of POST request enforcement, allowing an attacker to craft a malicious request that could be triggered by an authenticated user, thus allowing changes to the description of test objects without the user's direct intent.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially modify the descriptions of test objects within the JUnit plugin. While the impact is low, it could lead to misleading or confusing test results.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is a crafted malicious URL that, when visited by an authenticated user, would trigger the vulnerable endpoint in the JUnit plugin to set the test description.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to lure an authenticated Jenkins user to visit a malicious link or web page to trigger the CSRF attack. No specific permissions are required for the attacker besides the ability to send a request that looks like a legitimate request to the Jenkins server.
    *   The user has to have access to Jenkins
*   **Additional Notes:**
    *   The fix was to enforce POST requests for the vulnerable URL endpoint.
