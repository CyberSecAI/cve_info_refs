The provided content discusses a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in bigtreecms version 4.2.21, which is likely related to CVE-2018-1000521.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization when creating or modifying user data. Specifically, the email field does not properly sanitize special characters before it's rendered on the user listing page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is a stored XSS vulnerability. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected through the email field during user creation. This injected script is then executed when a user views the user list page.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A low-privileged administrator user can inject malicious JavaScript code, and when a high-privileged user (e.g., a developer) views the user list, the injected code executes within their browser session. This could allow the attacker to steal cookies, perform actions on behalf of the high-privileged user, or potentially gain full control of the application. The attacker can also manipulate the interface and conduct further attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the user creation form. The attacker, having low-privileged administrative access, adds or modifies a user's email field with a malicious payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have administrative access to create users. They also need to be able to manipulate the email field to inject the malicious script.
