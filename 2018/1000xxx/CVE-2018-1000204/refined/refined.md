  "CVE-2018-1000204": {
    "description": "It was discovered that an information leak existed in the generic SCSI driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).",
    "root_cause": "An information leak vulnerability existed in the generic SCSI driver in the Linux kernel due to incorrect handling of the SG_IO ioctl, leading to uninitialized memory being exposed to userspace.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Leak",
       "Improper Initialization"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could use this flaw to expose sensitive information by reading kernel memory.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access via a malformed SG_IO ioctl call on a SCSI device file."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Local user access to a SCSI device file."
       "CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO to access unzeroed memory"
    ],
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability has limited scope, as users don't usually have permissions to access SCSI devices, but some guides suggest making them world-writable. However, a check in the kernel in `sg_build_indirect()` will result in non-root users getting zeroed pages even if they can access `/dev/sg*` unless they also have `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` or `CAP_SYS_RAWIO` capabilities."
