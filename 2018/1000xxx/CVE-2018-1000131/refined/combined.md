sql inject in wordpress plugin wp-support-plus-responsive-ticket-system.
<https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-support-plus-responsive-ticket-system/>

there are two sql injects,one in the cookie value email and another in the post parameter "filter[order\_by]".

there is a picture for the test of the official website of responsive-ticket-system.
[![Aaron Swartz](/00theway/exp/raw/master/wordpress/wp.png)](/00theway/exp/blob/master/wordpress/wp.png)

the cookie is base64 encoded,a php serialized object.
and the parameter email in cookie was inject.

the post parameter "filter[order\_by]" was inject too but is blind.

the issuse fixed in the version 9.0.3 and after.

Please add a “hot-close-button” and
canned message: “This bug has been marked as a duplicate of XY ticket” with URL to main ticket
and other suggestion: “merge the same tickets” when the reply (solution is same)
