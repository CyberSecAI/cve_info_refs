Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper sanitization of user-supplied input within the "WP Support Plus Responsive Ticket System" WordPress plugin, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection via two attack vectors:
    *   **Cookie Value (`email`):**  The `email` parameter within a base64 encoded PHP serialized object stored in a cookie is vulnerable.
    *   **POST Parameter (`filter[order_by]`):** The `filter[order_by]` POST parameter is also vulnerable to SQL injection but is described as "blind."

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
*   Gain unauthorized access to the database
*   Modify or delete data within the database
*   Potentially gain control over the WordPress site

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Cookies:** By crafting a malicious base64 encoded PHP serialized object with SQL injection payloads in the email parameter and setting it as a cookie.
*   **HTTP POST Requests:** By sending a POST request containing the malicious SQL injection payload within the `filter[order_by]` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   For the cookie-based attack, the attacker needs to be able to manipulate cookies.
* No special privileges are required.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided text specifies that the issue was fixed in version 9.0.3 and later.
* The plugin has been closed as of November 23, 2022 and is not available for download as per the wordpress.org content
* One of the SQL injections is "blind", meaning the attacker might not see direct output from the database but can still manipulate it.
* The github content has a link to a picture that was used to test the exploit on the official website.
