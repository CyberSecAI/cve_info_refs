Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000840:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a weakness in how the `loadXML()` function within the Processing framework parses XML input. Specifically, it's vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XXE Injection:** The core issue is the lack of proper configuration and sanitization when parsing XML input. The `loadXML()` function doesn't prevent the processing of external entities defined within the XML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidential Data Disclosure:** Attackers can leverage the vulnerability to include arbitrary files from the system into the XML document. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.
*   **Automated HTTP Requests:** By crafting a malicious XML with external entity definitions that include HTTP requests, attackers can potentially exfiltrate the included data to a remote server they control.
*   **Arbitrary File Inclusion:** The vulnerability allows for arbitrary file inclusion from the system that parses the XML.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious XML Input:** The primary attack vector is providing a specially crafted XML document containing malicious external entity definitions.
*   **External DTD:** An external DTD is referenced which contains the malicious entities that extract local files and sends them via http.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Supply Malicious XML:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the vulnerable application with malicious XML.
*   **Access to Application's Parsing Functionality:** The attacker needs to target the application functionality that utilizes the vulnerable `loadXML()` function for parsing.
*   **Optional Access to External Server:** For data exfiltration, the attacker needs a remote server where the extracted data can be sent.

**Technical Details:**

The provided example clarifies the attack with these steps:

1.  The Processing script uses `loadXML()` to parse the malicious XML (`XXE.xml`).
2.  The XML references an external DTD from `http://lucapezzolla.com/xxe-test.dtd`.
3.  The remote DTD is parsed by the vulnerable XML parser. It contains entity definitions to read a local file (`/sys/power/image_size`) and exfiltrate its content via HTTP to `http://lucapezzolla.com/mirror.php`.
4.  The `mirror.php` page displays the request parameters, thereby exposing the exfiltrated file content.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content includes a clear, reproducible proof-of-concept scenario, making the vulnerability's impact and attack vectors very explicit.
*   The suggested remediation involves using the OWASP XML External Entity (XXE) Prevention Cheat Sheet.
