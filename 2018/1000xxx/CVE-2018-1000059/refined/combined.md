## Description

[![@prodigysml](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16996819?u=8ac045207384ce660425a4fdded4a836e20988a2&v=4&size=48)](/prodigysml)[prodigysml](https://github.com/prodigysml)opened [on Feb 3, 2018](https://github.com/validformbuilder/validformbuilder/issues/126#issue-294154754)
### Expected behavior

When some form data provided by the web application client for unserialize, PHP Object serialization should only be valid for ValidForm objects (or whatever they should be)

### Actual behavior

User can enter any PHP Object. This can lead to vulnerabilities like remote code execution and local file inclusion.

[validformbuilder/classes/ValidFormBuilder/ValidForm.php](https://github.com/validformbuilder/validformbuilder/blob/153efaaf47601b8372cc10852d881273d40eca1c/classes/ValidFormBuilder/ValidForm.php#L1165)

|  | \* Unserialize previously serialized ValidForm object |
| --- | --- |

This method requires an object to be provided with base64 encoding and gunzip. If we input a serialised PHP object with gunzipped and then base64 encoded, the vulnerability will trigger. I am yet to sift through all the code in the project to find an appropriate class to leverage.

### Which version/branch of ValidForm Builder do you use?

I use version/branch: 4.5.4
