## Description

[![@renini](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1587083?v=4&size=48)](/renini)[renini](https://github.com/renini)opened [on Sep 7, 2018](https://github.com/privacyidea/privacyidea/issues/1227#issue-357981297)

The failcounter increments on every token without a PIN when the user= parameter just has a .

In our case this resulted basically in a denial-of-service of our two factor authentication system, as by default any fail counter over 10 will lock the token out.

# What did you try to do?

Have tokens without PIN, for example in our setup we have HOTP, TOTP and VASCO tokens without PIN.

Then a request with a user= will increment the failcounter for all these tokens.

**For example with httpie:**

`http http://localhost:5000/validate/check "pass=" "user= "`

**Or with curl:**

`curl http://localhost:5000/validate/check --data "pass=&user= "`

This will return: "**wrong otp value**" and increment all failcounters by 1.

# What outcome did you expect?

Since the **user=** parameter does not match any user in privacyidea with a token, i was expecting it to just deny/drop the request.

# What outcome did you experience?

All tokens verifications were blocked because all failcounters where incremented to their current max of 10. And any valid check would output the following **"matching 1 tokens, Failcounter exceeded"**.

# Configuration

Tested on privacyIDEA 2.22 and 2.23.1.

Debian stable, virtualenv.

# Extra information

I'm suspecting something wrong in the logic of [privacyidea/lib/token.py#L2205](https://github.com/privacyidea/privacyidea/blob/aded3ad61a281412f761023430219f59debb4c96/privacyidea/lib/token.py#L2205), so that this is matching all tokens without a PIN.

```
    elif pin_matching_token_list:
        # We did not find a valid token and no challenge.
        # But there are tokens, with a matching pin.
        # So we increase the failcounter. Return failure.
        for tokenobject in pin_matching_token_list:
            tokenobject.inc_failcount()
            reply_dict["message"] = "wrong otp value"

```
