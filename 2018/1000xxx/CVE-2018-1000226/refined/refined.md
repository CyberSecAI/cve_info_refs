Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000226:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the improper or absent validation of authentication tokens in numerous endpoints of the Cobbler XMLRPC API. While many API methods require a security token, the implementation of these methods often neglects to actually check the validity of the provided token, or simply ignores it entirely.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access control due to the failure to validate security tokens. This allows unauthenticated users to access and execute functions that should be restricted to authorized users.
*   **Unauthenticated API Access:**  The API is effectively unauthenticated as a large number of endpoints do not validate the provided tokens, allowing anyone to invoke the methods.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Due to the ability to invoke administrative methods without authentication, attackers can gain elevated privileges.
*   **Insecure defaults:** The `anamon_enabled` setting is disabled by default, which is designed to prevent unauthenticated users from uploading log data. However, because an unauthenticated user can enable this setting by using `modify_setting` endpoint, it makes this default insecure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading a crafted log file via the `upload_log_data` endpoint once `anamon_enabled` is set to true, an attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can use endpoints like `rename_*`, `disable_netboot`, etc., to manipulate the server's state.
*   **Configuration Tampering:** Attackers can use `modify_setting` to change crucial Cobbler settings, including the LDAP server, potentially gaining control of user credentials.
*   **Denial of Service:**  Attackers can potentially delete systems, disrupt services, or alter configurations which leads to denial of service.
*   **Data Exfiltration/Deletion:** Attackers can exfiltrate data by using `get_systems_since`, or delete important data like the list of systems by using `delete_systems`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attack vector is network-based, requiring access to the `/cobbler_api` endpoint of the Cobbler server, which is commonly exposed on port 80 or 443.
*   **XMLRPC API:** The vulnerabilities are located within the Cobbler XMLRPC API.
*   **Unvalidated Parameters:** The attack relies on exploiting the lack of validation of the security token parameter within the API endpoints.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Cobbler server, specifically the `/cobbler_api` endpoint.
*   **Basic knowledge of XMLRPC:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the XMLRPC API, however this is easily achieved with the provided python snippets.
*  **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication is required to exploit the vulnerabilities.

**Additional Details:**

*   The blog post provides a detailed explanation and proof-of-concept (PoC) code snippets.
*   It identifies at least 70 API endpoints vulnerable to this issue.
*   It provides the timeline for responsible disclosure, and shows the lack of response from the maintainers.
*   The vulnerable versions include Cobbler 2.6.11+, and potentially older versions 2.0.0+.
*   It highlights the ability to inject malicious javascript code to be run by any user of the Cobbler UI.
*   It mentions that this vulnerability is tracked under CVE-2018-1000226.
