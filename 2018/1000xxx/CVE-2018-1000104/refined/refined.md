**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Plaintext storage of passwords.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Jenkins administrators could also retrieve the passwords, potentially leading to exposure through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, etc.

**Attack vectors:**
- Access to the Jenkins controller's local file system.
- Exploitation of vulnerabilities that allow access to administrator's session data, potentially via browser extensions or XSS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the Jenkins controller's local file system.
- High-level privileges within the Jenkins environment (e.g. administrator access).

**Additional Notes:**
- The plugin now uses the Credentials Plugin to store passwords and automatically migrates existing passwords.
- The plugin has been deprecated and its functionality has been migrated to the Synopsys Coverity Jenkins plugin.
