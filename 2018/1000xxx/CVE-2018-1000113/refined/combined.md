This plug-in integrates Jenkins and [TestLink](http://testlink.org/) and
generates reports on automated test execution. With this plug-in you can
manage your tests in TestLink, schedule and control in Jenkins, and
execute using your favorite test execution tool (TestPartner, Selenium,
TestNG, Perl modules, PHPUnit, among others).

This plug-in is not part of TestLink project, issues regarding Jenkins
and TestLink integration must be reported in [Jenkins
JIRA](http://issues.jenkins-ci.org/). It has been reported by users that
it is also possible to use ReportNG, as this tool has an option to
output TestNG XML too.

When filing an issue, remember to include as much data as possible, but
avoid including sensitive data, as attachments can take a while to be
deleted from JIRA, as the process is manual and quite troublesome

#### [Who is using Jenkins TestLink Plug-in](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Who%2Bis%2Busing%2BTestLink%2BPlug-in)

[Let us know if you are using this
plug-in.](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Who%2Bis%2Busing%2BTestLink%2BPlug-in)

## Description

The TestLink plug-in integrates **Jenkins** with
[TestLink](http://testlink.org/). TestLink plug-in uses
[testlink-java-api](http://testlinkjavaapi.sourceforge.net/ "testlink-java-api")
to access TestLink **XML-RPC** API. With the information that you
provide in the build step configuration the plug-in **retrieves
automated tests from TestLink**. With the plug-in, you are able to
execute **build steps** that call testing tools. It reads **TestNG**,
**JUnit** and **TAP** test report **formats**, used to update TestLink
test cases' executions.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/testlink/docs/images/1.png){width="900"}

The job configuration changed! Now there are three sections, what helps
you to configure your job, and add extra build steps, result seeking
strategies and general information about TestLink.

TestLink configuration section

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/testlink/docs/images/001.PNG){width="900"}

Test Execution section

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/testlink/docs/images/002.PNG){width="900"}

And Result Seeking Strategy section

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/testlink/docs/images/003.PNG){width="900"}

You can use environment variables in Test project name, Test plan name
or Build name. For instance, build-project-$BUILD\_NUMBER would be
replaced by build-project- and the number of the Build executed in
Jenkins.

#### How does the plug-in execute my automated tests?

TestLink Plug-in retrieves automated test cases data from TestLink. This
data is then set as environment variables. This way your build steps can
make use of this information to execute your automated tests.

For instance, you could run ant passing a Test Class as parameter, more
or less something like this, /opt/java/apache-ant-1.8.0/bin/ant
-DtestClass=$TESTLINK\_TESTCASE\_TEST\_CLASS. In this case, Test Case is
the name of a custom field in TestLink.

List of environment variables available during TestLink Plug-in
execution of single build steps
([JENKINS-17622](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-17622)):

* TESTLINK\_BUILD\_NAME
* TESTLINK\_TESTPLAN\_NAME
* TESTLINK\_TESTPROJECT\_NAME
* TESTLINK\_TESTCASE\_TOTAL

List of environment variables available during TestLink Plug-in
execution of iterative build steps:

* TESTLINK\_TESTCASE\_ID
* TESTLINK\_TESTCASE\_NAME
* TESTLINK\_TESTCASE\_TESTPROJECTID
* TESTLINK\_TESTCASE\_AUTHOR
* TESTLINK\_TESTCASE\_SUMMARY
* TESTLINK\_BUILD\_NAME
* TESTLINK\_TESTCASE\_TESTSUITEID
* TESTLINK\_TESTPLAN\_NAME
* TESTLINK\_TESTPROJECT\_NAME
* TESTLINK\_TESTCASE\_$CUSTOM\_FIELD\_NAME

For each Custom Field found, TestLink Plug-in defines an environment
variable for with its name and value, as shown above
(%CUSTOM\_FIELD\_NAME%). If the custom field name contains spaces the
plug-in will convert them into \_'s. i.e., Test Class can be accessed as
%TESTLINK\_TESTCASE\_TEST\_CLASS% in Windows or
$TESTLINK\_TESTCASE\_TEST\_CLASS in \*nix-like systems.

For each test case, the plug-in executes one call for each custom field.
In other words, if you have 1000 tests in a test plan, the plug-in will
execute a lot of calls to TestLink, downgrading the execution of your
job.

#### How does the plug-in know if a test passed or failed?

You can choose among different **result seeking strategies** in your job
configuration. The plug-in supports three **result formats**, *TestNG*,
*JUnit* and *TAP*.

###### TestNG result seeking strategies

**TestNG class name**: The plug-in matches the TestNG class name (e.g.:
org.tap4j.TestParser) and the key custom field value.

**TestNG method name**: The plug-in matches the TestNG method name
(e.g.: org.tap4j.TestParser#testTokenizer) and the key custom field
value.

**TestNG suite name**: The plug-in matches the TestNG suite name (e.g.:
functional tests) and the key custom field value.

###### JUnit result seeking strategies

**JUnit case class name**: The plug-in matches the JUnit case class name
(e.g.: org.tap4j.TestParser) and the key custom field value.

**JUnit case name**: The plug-in matches the JUnit case class name
(e.g.: testTokenizer) and the key custom field value.

**JUnit method name**: The plug-in matches the JUnit case class name
(e.g.: org.tap4j.TestParser#testTokenizer) and the key custom field
value.

**JUnit suite name**: The plug-in matches the JUnit suite name
(e.g.:functional tests) and the key custom field value.

###### TAP result seeking strategies

**TAP file name**: The plug-in matches the TAP file name (e.g.:
testFtpProtocol.tap) and the key custom field value.

**TAP file name multiple test points:** Adds one test execution in
TestLink for each TAP Test Result with its execution status

## Configuration

1. Download and install the latest version of TestLink
   (<http://testlink.org/>).
2. Create automated tests in TestLink with Custom Field for automation.
3. Install the TestLink plug-in from the Jenkins Plugin Manager
4. Define a TestLink configuration from the Configure System page.
5. Add a Invoke TestLink build step in the job you want execute
   automated tests.
6. Configure the required properties.

## Languages Supported

1. English (American)
2. Portuguese (Brazil)

## Descriptions

### Environment Injector Plugin before 1.91 stored sensitive build variables

**SECURITY-248**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`envinject`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/envinject)**

**Description:**

EnvInject plugin stores environment variables in order to visualize them in the "Injected Environment Variables" view.
Sensitive build variables, typically passwords, are exempt from this behavior.
Plugin versions older than 1.91 (released on Mar 08, 2015) however did not exempt sensitive variables, and persisted them on disk too.
Such persisted sensitive variables may be displayed by any release of this plugin for builds run before it was updated to version 1.91 or newer.

While the bug persisting sensitive build variables has been addressed in release 1.91, there is no fix addressing this problem for historical build data.

You may be affected by this sensitive data exposure issue if all of the following are true:

* You define sensitive environment variables globally, per node, or per job.
* You have ever used Environment Injector Plugin 1.90 or older.
* You still have build records created while Environment Injector Plugin 1.90 or older was installed and enabled.

To prevent the further exposure of sensitive build variables, we recommend that you take the following steps if you are affected by this:

* Disable the visualization of Injected Environment variables in the global configuration.
  After this change the data will be accessible only to those ones who have access to raw build.xml files.
  This is a reversible action that can be applied immediately, and can be reverted once you’ve purged the data on disk (below).
* Remove the sensitive data from disk by manually removing corresponding entries from `injectedEnvVars.txt` files, or deleting the `injectedEnvVars.txt` files in old build directories.
* Rotate all secrets that have potentially been exposed.
### Coverity Plugin stored keystore and private key passwords in plain text

**SECURITY-260
/
CVE-2018-1000104**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`coverity`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/coverity)**

**Description:**

The Coverity Plugin stored passwords unencrypted as part of its configuration.
This allowed users with Jenkins controller local file system access and Jenkins administrators to retrieve the stored password.
The latter could result in exposure of the passwords through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

The Coverity Plugin now integrates with [Credentials Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials) to store passwords, and automatically migrates existing passwords.

### Improper access control in Gerrit Trigger Plugin allowed unauthorized users to read some server configuration information

**SECURITY-402
/
CVE-2018-1000105**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`gerrit-trigger`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gerrit-trigger)**

**Description:**

Missing permission checks in Gerrit Trigger Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read permission to access a form that showed the configuration of Gerrit servers in Jenkins.
The key file password was only shown in its encrypted form, if configured.
Other options were plainly visible.

The missing permission check has been added.

### Improper access control in Gerrit Trigger Plugin allowed unauthorized users to modify global Gerrit Server configurations

**SECURITY-403
/
CVE-2018-1000106**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`gerrit-trigger`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gerrit-trigger)**

**Description:**

Missing permission checks in Gerrit Trigger Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read permission to perform the following actions:

* Configure Gerrit servers
* Connect and disconnect configured Gerrit servers

The missing permission checks have been added.

### Improper access control allowed users without ManageOwnership permission to change job ownership metadata in Job and Node ownership Plugin

**SECURITY-498
/
CVE-2018-1000107**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ownership`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ownership)**

**Description:**

Job and Node ownership Plugin did not prevent the ownership metadata being overwritten when a job or node configuration was updated from the CLI or using the remote API (`POST config.xml`).

This allowed users with Job/Configure permission but without ManageOwnership/Jobs permission to change job ownership metadata, and users with Computer/Configure but without ManageOwnership/Nodes to change node ownership metadata.

Changes to job or node ownership metadata via remote API now require ManageOwnership/Jobs or ManageOwnership/Nodes permission, respectively.
Changes to job or node ownership via CLI require Overall/Administer permission.

### Azure Slave Plugin bundled outdated httpclient library with denial of service vulnerability

**SECURITY-554
/
CVE-2015-5262**

**Severity (CVSS):**
medium

**Affected plugin:
[`azure-slave-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/azure-slave-plugin)**

**Description:**

The Azure Slave Plugin bundles a version of the httpclient library that is vulnerable to [CVE-2015-5262](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-5262).

As the plugin has been deprecated in favor of [Azure VM Agents Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/azure-vm-agents) in 2016, there are no plans to release a fix.
It has been removed from distribution per request by the former maintainers.

### Reflected cross-site-scripting vulnerability in report URL of CppNCSS Plugin

**SECURITY-712
/
CVE-2018-1000108**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`cppncss`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/cppncss)**

**Description:**

CppNCSS Plugin did not properly escape the report name and graph name, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.

Report name and graph name are now properly escaped.

### Unprivileged users are able to enumerate credential IDs in Google Play Android Publisher Plugin

**SECURITY-715
/
CVE-2018-1000109**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`google-play-android-publisher`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/google-play-android-publisher)**

**Description:**

Google Play Android Publisher Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring a job to select the one they’d like to use to authenticate with the Google Play API.

This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credential IDs.
Those could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

Additionally, a related form validation function would allow verification whether a specified credential is valid for use with the Google Play API.

Enumeration of credentials IDs and validation of specified credentials in this plugin now requires the permission to have the ExtendedRead permission (when that permission is enabled; otherwise Configure permission) to the job in whose context credentials are being accessed.

### Disclosure of user names and node names to unauthorized users through post-commit hook URL in Git Plugin

**SECURITY-723
/
CVE-2018-1000110**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`git`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/git)**

**Description:**

The class handling unauthenticated Git post-commit hook notification requests at the `/git/` path unnecessarily extended another type that handled requests to the `â¦/search/` sub-path.

This allowed submission of search queries to Jenkins, and getting a list of search results usually available to anyone with Overall/Read permission.
In current Jenkins releases, those are typically the names of known users (both actual users of Jenkins, and known SCM committers) and nodes (built-in node and agents).

The class handling requests to `/git/` no longer extends the class handling requests to the `â¦/search/` sub-path, therefore any such requests will fail.

### Disclosure of user names and node names to unauthorized users through post-commit hook URL in Subversion Plugin

**SECURITY-724
/
CVE-2018-1000111**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`subversion`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/subversion)**

**Description:**

The class handling unauthenticated Subversion post-commit hook notification requests at the `/subversion/` path unnecessarily extended another type that handled requests to the `â¦/search/` sub-path.

This allowed submission of search queries to Jenkins, and getting a list of search results usually available to anyone with Overall/Read permission.
In current Jenkins releases, those are typically the names of known users (both actual users of Jenkins, and known SCM committers) and nodes (built-in node and agents).

The class handling requests to `/subversion/` no longer extends the class handling requests to the `â¦/search/` sub-path, therefore any such requests will fail.

### Disclosure of user names and node names to unauthorized users through post-commit hook URL in Mercurial Plugin

**SECURITY-726
/
CVE-2018-1000112**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`mercurial`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/mercurial)**

**Description:**

The class handling unauthenticated Mercurial post-commit hook notification requests at the `/mercurial/` path unnecessarily extended another type that handled requests to the `â¦/search/` sub-path.

This allowed submission of search queries to Jenkins, and getting a list of search results usually available to anyone with Overall/Read permission.
In current Jenkins releases, those are typically the names of known users (both actual users of Jenkins, and known SCM committers) and nodes (built-in node and agents).

The class handling requests to `/mercurial/` no longer extends the class handling requests to the `â¦/search/` sub-path, therefore any such requests will fail.

### Stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in TestLink Plugin

**SECURITY-731
/
CVE-2018-1000113**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`testlink`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/testlink)**

**Description:**

Users with Job/Configure permission were able to configure TestLink reports to display arbitrary unescaped HTML e.g. in test case names.

The plugin now properly escapes its HTML output.

### Promoted Builds Plugin allowed unauthorized users to run some promotion processes

**SECURITY-746
/
CVE-2018-1000114**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`promoted-builds`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/promoted-builds)**

**Description:**

Users with Job/Read access were able to approve and re-execute promotion processes with a manual promotion condition that did not specify a list of users allowed to manually approve the promotion.

The plugin now requires users to have the Promotion/Promote permission to be able to approve or re-execute a promotion with manual condition that does not specify a list of users allowed to approve it.

The following additional changes to permission enforcement were implemented in this update to make condition enforcement consistent for the three actions Approve, Re-Execute, and Force:

|  | Some of these changes allow users to act on some promotions they were not able to act on in 2.x releases of this plugin. |
| --- | --- |

1. Users with just the Promotion/Promote permission are no longer allowed to re-execute or force promotions with a manual condition that specifies a list of users, unless the user is on that list.
2. Administrators are now able to approve any promotion with a manual condition.
3. Users specified in a manual promotion condition are now allowed to force this promotion.
