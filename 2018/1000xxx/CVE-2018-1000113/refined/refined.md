Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-1000113:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The TestLink plugin for Jenkins did not properly escape HTML output in reports, specifically in test case names.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This occurs because the plugin allows users with Job/Configure permission to inject arbitrary, unescaped HTML into TestLink reports through fields like test case names.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious HTML/JavaScript into the TestLink report, which would then be executed in the browsers of other users viewing the report within Jenkins. This could allow attackers to:
- Steal session cookies
- Perform actions on behalf of the user viewing the report
- Redirect users to malicious websites
- Modify the content of the Jenkins page viewed

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker with Job/Configure permission can configure a Jenkins job to include malicious HTML in fields used in the TestLink reports.
- When other users view the report within Jenkins, the injected HTML executes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have Job/Configure permission for at least one Jenkins project that is integrated with TestLink.
- The attacker needs to be able to configure TestLink reports.
