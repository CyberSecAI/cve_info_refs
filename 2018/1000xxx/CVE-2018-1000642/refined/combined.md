# The Issue

Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) may allow an attacker to execute JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This may lead to unauthorised actions being performed, unauthorised access to data, stealing of session information, denial of service, etc. An attacker needs to coerce a user into visiting a link with the XSS payload to be properly exploited against a victim.

# Where the Issue Occurred

The following code shows that the `$_GET['registration']` variable is reflected to the victim's browser without any input validation, leading to reflected XSS:

[FlightAirMap/registration-sub-menu.php](https://github.com/Ysurac/FlightAirMap/blob/aee2fd646e98a96b6125a83a1a05fc5adf202447/registration-sub-menu.php#L18)

Line 18
in
[aee2fd6](/Ysurac/FlightAirMap/commit/aee2fd646e98a96b6125a83a1a05fc5adf202447)

|  | <li><a href="<?php print $globalURL; ?>/registration/<?php print $\_GET['registration']; ?>" <?php if (strtolower($current\_page) == "registration-detailed"){ print 'class="active"'; } ?>><?php echo \_("Detailed"); ?></a></li> |
| --- | --- |

An example payload for the registration variable is given below:

```
"><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
```

# FlightAirMap Reflected XSS

August 5, 2018 · Sajeeb Lohani · CVE-2018-1000642

## The Issue

Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) may allow an attacker to execute JavaScript code in the context of the victim’s browser. This may lead to unauthorised actions being performed, unauthorised access to data, stealing of session information, denial of service, etc. An attacker needs to coerce a user into visiting a link with the XSS payload to be properly exploited against a victim.

The FlightAirMap registration-sub-menu file overly trusts user-controlled input. This lack of sufficient sanitisation allows an attacker to execute JavaScript code in the context of a victim’s browser.

## Where the Issue Occurred

The code below displays the GET variable without sufficient sanitisation (found on line 18 [FlightAirMap/registration-sub-menu.php#18](https://github.com/Ysurac/FlightAirMap/blob/aee2fd646e98a96b6125a83a1a05fc5adf202447/registration-sub-menu.php#L18)):

```
<li><a href="<?php print $globalURL; ?>/registration/<?php print $_GET['registration']; ?>" <?php if (strtolower($current_page) == "registration-detailed"){print 'class="active"'; } ?>><?php echo _("Detailed"); ?></a></li>

```
