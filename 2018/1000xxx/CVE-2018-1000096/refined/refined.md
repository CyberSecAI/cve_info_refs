The content relates to CVE-2018-1000096.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The tiny-json-http library, by default, disabled SSL certificate validation, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. This was a deliberate design choice to simplify local development using self-signed certificates.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing SSL certificate validation. The library does not verify the SSL/TLS certificates of the servers it connects to.
- Implicit trust of all network infrastructure between client and server, including routers, switches, wireless access points, and DNS servers.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks become possible. An attacker can intercept and modify communication between the client using the library and the remote server, potentially stealing sensitive information, manipulating data, or injecting malicious content.
- Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive information like Slack tokens or credentials.
- Data breaches and compromised systems are possible.
- If used in a bot within a channel with dissidents, their communications could be intercepted.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based MitM attacks.
- Attackers can intercept traffic through compromised routers, switches, wireless access points, or DNS servers.
- An attacker could perform the attack simply by being on the same network as a user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to intercept network traffic between the client using the library and the remote server.
- The attacker does not need to be within the Slack datacenter for targeted attacks.
