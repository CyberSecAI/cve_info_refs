The provided content is related to CVE-2018-1000658. It describes a commit that addresses vulnerabilities in the file upload functionality of LimeSurvey.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation and sanitization of file paths and sizes during file uploads and ZIP archive extractions. Specifically, the application was vulnerable to:

1.  **Zip Bomb attacks:** An attacker could upload a specially crafted ZIP archive that, when extracted, would create an excessive number of files or very large files, potentially leading to a denial-of-service.
2.  **Path traversal:** An attacker could potentially manipulate file paths within a ZIP archive to extract files outside the intended directory, leading to overwriting or access of sensitive files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Lack of validation of the size of zip archive before extraction
*   Lack of sanitization of file paths within the zip archives, allowing relative paths to be used during extraction.
*   Usage of a predictable method for creating temporary directories.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Denial of service (DoS) due to zip bomb attacks exhausting server resources (disk space, processing power).
*   Arbitrary file overwrite/read due to path traversal during zip extraction, leading to potential compromise of the application or server.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Uploading a specially crafted zip archive via the file upload functionality
*   Manipulating the content and file paths within the uploaded zip archive

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to upload files to the LimeSurvey instance. This is likely an authenticated action.

**Technical details:**

The commit `91d143230eb357260a19c8424b3005deb49a47f7` implements the following fixes:
*   The commit introduces a new function `createRandomTempDir` in `application/helpers/common_helper.php` to create temporary directories using a random string. This replaces the usage of `_tempdir` function in `application/core/Survey_Common_Action.php` which created predictable temporary directories.
*   The commit introduces a function `isZipBomb` to check if a zip archive is a zip bomb, by checking if the total size of files within the archive exceeds maximum upload size.
*   The commit implements a check in the PclZip constructor (`application/third_party/pclzip/pclzip.lib.php`) using `isZipBomb()` to prevent zip bomb attacks during archive extraction.
*   The commit calls `get_absolute_path()` to sanitize paths during file extraction in `pclzip.lib.php`.
*   The functions `getRandomString` and `crypto_rand_secure` are added to `application/helpers/common_helper.php` to generate random strings.

The commit `20fc85edccc80e7e7f162613542792380c44446a` introduces `isZipBomb()` and `get_zip_originalsize()` functions in `application/helpers/common_helper.php` and uses `isZipBomb` in `pclzip.lib.php` to prevent Zip Bomb attacks. It also adds `get_absolute_path()` to sanitize paths.
