Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2018-1000013:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Release plugin did not require form submissions to be submitted via the POST method. This lack of enforcement allowed for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The plugin failed to validate the origin of form submissions, allowing an attacker to craft malicious requests that could be triggered by a victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to trigger release builds without the victim's knowledge or consent.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CSRF:** An attacker can craft a malicious web page or link that, when accessed by an authenticated Jenkins user, would trigger a release build request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated Jenkins user (victim) into accessing a malicious link or web page.
*   The attacker does not need any specific privileges or access to the Jenkins instance itself.

**Summary:**

The Release plugin was vulnerable to a CSRF attack due to the absence of proper validation of form submission methods. An attacker could leverage this to trigger arbitrary release builds by tricking a logged-in user into visiting a malicious website.
