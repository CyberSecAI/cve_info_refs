Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-1000132:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the Mercurial HTTP server's lack of proper permission checking for certain wire protocol commands and the batch wire protocol command. Specifically, the server failed to consult configured access control options like `web.allow-pull`, `web.allow-push`, and `deny_read` before executing these commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Missing Permission Checks:** Wire protocol commands that didn't explicitly declare their permissions were not subjected to any permission checks. This allowed bypassing configured access controls.
2.  **Batch Wire Protocol Bypass:** The batch wire protocol command did not list its permission requirements nor enforce permissions on individual subcommands, allowing execution of unauthorized commands.
3. **Incorrect Access Control**: The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-285, indicating a general issue of improper access control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers could access data that should have been restricted by `web.*` configuration options, enabling reads on repositories that shouldn't allow read access.
*   **Unauthorized Data Modification:** Attackers could modify data via wire protocol commands that can mutate data, even in scenarios where the server is supposed to be read-only. A well-crafted batch command could invoke write operations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable via network connectivity to the Mercurial HTTP server.
*   **Wire Protocol Commands:** Attackers could exploit the lack of permission checks in individual wire protocol commands.
*   **Crafted Batch Commands:**  A specially crafted batch command could be used to bypass restrictions and execute commands that perform unauthorized writes or reads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Mercurial HTTP server.
*   **Knowledge of Wire Protocol:**  The attacker needs to have a knowledge of the Mercurial wire protocol to craft specific commands.
*  **No authentication required:** According to the description, the attack could be performed without any authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects all Mercurial versions prior to 4.5.2.
*   The issue regarding wire protocol commands has existed since Mercurial 1.0.
*   The batch wire protocol vulnerability is present since version 1.9.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Mercurial 4.5.2.
*   The fix involves enforcing permission checks on affected wire protocol commands and the batch wire protocol command.
