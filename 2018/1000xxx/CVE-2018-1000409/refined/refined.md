- **Root cause of vulnerability:** When a user signs up for a new account on Jenkins instances using Jenkins' own user database, the existing session was not invalidated and a new one was not created, leading to session fixation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Session fixation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially hijack a user's session.
- **Attack vectors:** User signup process on Jenkins instances using Jenkins' own user database.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No specific privileges are needed, attacker just needs to initiate user signup process. The attacker needs to trick a user into using the pre-set session ID (e.g. via sending a link to a user).
