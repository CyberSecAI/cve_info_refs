### @nvt **[nvt](/nvt)** commented [Aug 20, 2018](#issue-352145656) • edited Loading

Addresses the issues pointed out in [#594](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/issues/594), [#595](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/issues/595), [#596](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/issues/596), [#597](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/issues/597), [#598](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/issues/598), and [#599](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/issues/599).

The attack vector, as pointed out in the reports, is limited to when an attacker has access to insert DB queries directly, which should not be allowed for multiple reasons. Still, the reports will help remove some crashes on invalid input.

Next on the agenda is to create a new set of tests for storage (including tests for the aforementioned issues), but this will be addressed in a later PR.

Thanks to [@cve-reporting](https://github.com/cve-reporting) for the report, and sorry for the late reply -- a long vacation just ended.

Fixes [#594](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/issues/594)

Fixes [#595](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/issues/595)

Fixes [#599](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/issues/599)

Sorry, something went wrong.

## Description

[![@cve-reporting](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36542150?v=4&size=48)](/cve-reporting)[cve-reporting](https://github.com/cve-reporting)opened [on Jul 9, 2018](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/issues/594#issue-339485301)

Function next\_token that provides next token during AQL parsing tries to memcpy input data (part of AQL files) into fixed size buffer.

Allocated buffer can fit only DB\_MAX\_ELEMENT\_SIZE (16) bytes and the check is missing.

Crash line: aql-lexer.c:238

Declaration of buffer:

aql.h:117:

typedef char value\_t[DB\_MAX\_ELEMENT\_SIZE];

db\_options.h:104:

#define DB\_MAX\_ELEMENT\_SIZE 16

aql.h:123:

value\_t value;

aql-lexer.c:119-125:

int

lexer\_start(lexer\_t \*lexer, char \*input, token\_t \*token, value\_t \*value)

{

lexer->input = input;

lexer->prev\_pos = input;

lexer->token = token;

lexer->value = value;

Overflow:

aql-lexer.c:239:

memcpy(lexer->value, s, length);

This could lead to Remote Code Execution via stack smashing attack (overwriting the function return address).

The risk of this issue is reduced (Attack Vector:Local) because attacker would need to run malicious AQL query, however it is quite possible when using database in IoT application.

Proposed CVSS score:

CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H (9.3 - critical)

Following AQL code will trigger crash (crash\_001\_next\_token.sql):

E0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Mitigation :

The size of input token should be limited to DB\_MAX\_ELEMENT\_SIZE.

Please take a look at patch fixing this issue in TizenRT (using antelope engine as arastorage):
