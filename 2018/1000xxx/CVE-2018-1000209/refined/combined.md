* **NEW**: Sensu Core 1.7.1 no longer supports Debian 7, which has reached end of life.
* **BUGFIX**: Sensu now triggers a reconnect when trying to publish to RabbitMQ when in a disconnected state.
* **BUGFIX**: Use `--no-document` when installing gems via `sensu-install` instead of deprecated `--no-ri --no-rdoc`.

## Core 1.7.0 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#170---2019-02-19)

**February 21, 2019** — Sensu Core version 1.7.0 has been released
and is available for immediate download. Please note the following
improvements:

### CHANGES

* **NEW**: Sensu now includes a built-in client deregistration extension. See the [client reference](/sensu-core/1.7/reference/clients/#deregistration-events) to configure the deregistration extension.
* **NEW**: Sensu now provides opt-in global error handling. See the [Sensu configuration reference](/sensu-core/1.7/reference/configuration#sensu-definition-specification) for more information.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: The health API now returns information to help diagnose an unhealthy Sensu instance, including transport consumer and message counts. See the [API docs](/sensu-core/1.7/api/health-and-info) for more information.
* **BUGFIX**: The clients API GET endpoints now redact sensitive attributes as defined in the [client configuration](/sensu-core/1.7/reference/clients/#client-attributes).
* **BUGFIX**: Stale server registry entries now expire after 30 seconds without an update.
* **BUGFIX**: Token substitution now splits default values on the first instance of the pipe character, fixing a bug impacting regular expressions in token substitution default values.
* **BUGFIX**: Fixed a bug causing incorrect tokens in check requests created using the Sensu API.
* **BUGFIX**: Improved error logging.

## Core 1.6.2 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#162---2018-12-07)

**December 10, 2018** — Sensu Core version 1.6.2 has been released
and is available for immediate download. Please note the following
improvements:

### CHANGES

* **IMPROVEMENT**: Sensu Core now includes the Sensu Translator: a command-line
  tool to help you transfer your Sensu Core 1.x configuration to Sensu Go 5.0.
  For more information, see the [Sensu Translator on GitHub](https://github.com/sensu/sensu-translator), and read the [Sensu Go migrate guide](https://docs.sensu.io/sensu-go/latest/operations/maintain-sensu/migrate/).
* **BUGFIX**: Sensu Core 1.6.2 improves error handling for Redis Sentinel
  connections. In the event of a Sentinel DNS lookup error, Sensu now
  retries the failing Sentinel instances until they become available, but
  proceeds with normal operation as long as one Sentinel can direct Sensu to
  the current Redis leader.

## Core 1.6.1 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#161---2018-10-23)

**October 23, 2018** — Sensu Core version 1.6.1 has been released
and is available for immediate download. Please note the following
improvements:

### CHANGES

* **BUGFIX**: Fixed an issue preventing Sensu clients from resuming activities
  after reconnecting to RabbitMQ.

## Core 1.6.0 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#160---2018-10-12)

**October 12, 2018** — Sensu Core version 1.6.0 has been released
and is available for immediate download. Please note the following
improvements:

### CHANGES

* **NEW**: The [Checks API](/sensu-core/1.6/api/checks#checkscheck-delete) now provides an endpoint to delete check history and
  check results, giving you an easy way to clean up unused checks.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Sensu Core 1.6 implements changes in RabbitMQ communication
  by using two discrete connections to the transport instead of two channels
  on a single connection, thereby doubling the number of concurrent connections
  RabbitMQ receives. This change prevents check result processing rates from
  being impacted by check execution request publishing rates and reduces the
  possibility of false keepalive alerts under certain conditions. To support
  the increased number of concurrent connections, we recommend making sure
  the open file limit is configured according to RabbitMQ’s guidelines for
  [Ubuntu/Debian](https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-debian.html#kernel-resource-limits) and [RHEL/CentOS](https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-rpm.html#kernel-resource-limits).
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Sensu now redacts additional fields (such as webhook URLs)
  when displaying configuration files.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Commands in check results from proxy clients can often contain
  sensitive information following token substitution. Clients now reset
  commands to remove tokens before publishing check results, providing
  better handling for sensitive information.
* **BUGFIX**: Fixed a bug impacting macOS packages using Ruby 2.4.4.
* **BUGFIX**: Fixed an issue impacting FreeBSD packages causing incompatibility with newer compilers.
* **BUGFIX**: Fixed a bug impacting the installation process for Solaris 10 packages.

## Core 1.5.0 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#150---2018-09-04)

**September 4, 2018** — Sensu Core version 1.5.0 has been released
and is available for immediate download. Please note the following
improvements:

### CHANGES

* **IMPROVEMENT**: The built-in check dependencies filter lets you
  reduce noise by only alerting for the root cause of a given failure.
  Sensu Core 1.5 gives you the option to specify check dependencies by subscription
  instead of by client, making this useful filter even more flexible.
  See the [filter reference doc](/sensu-core/1.5/reference/filters#check-dependencies-filter) for more information.
* **BUGFIX**: Improved validation for check results created using the
  results API and the client socket. Sensu now validates check result
  attributes with the same methods used to validate check definitions.
* **BUGFIX**: Fixed a bug in the Sensu package that impacted user and group
  creation on Linux. Sensu now checks for an existing “sensu” user and group
  against multiple providers.
* **BUGFIX**: Sensu packages now include Ruby 2.4.4. This includes a fix
  for a bug in Ruby 2.4.1 that impacted Sensu clients on AIX.

## Core 1.4.3 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#143---2018-07-23)

**July 24, 2018** — Sensu Core version 1.4.3 has been
released and is available for immediate download. Please note
the following improvements:

### CHANGES

* **BUGFIX**: Failures when using token substitution to provide a value
  for the check `source` attribute could cause the value of `source`
  to be returned as an empty string, causing unexpected display and user
  experience behaviors in the dashboard. The `source` attribute is now
  removed by the client when its value is empty.
* **BUGFIX**: When using a handler extension, a bug in filter log
  messages made it possible for handler extension class variables to
  be leaked into Sensu’s log files. Some users experienced very large
  logfiles as a symptom of this behavior. Handler extensions may now
  use class instance variables without having them leak into the log
  file.
* **BUGFIX**: Lack of validation for check result `ttl` attribute on
  the /results API endpoint made it possible to submit check results
  with invalid TTL values and subsequently cause the Sensu server to
  crash. The /results API endpoint now appropriately applies
  validation to check result `ttl` attribute values.
* **BUGFIX**: Check definitions generated using token substitution and
  `proxy_requests` check definition attributes were not updated when
  token values changed, causing unexpected behavior in proxy request checks.
  This has been fixed in the Sensu server by preventing the
  original check definition from being mutated.
* **BUGFIX**: Under systemd, post-installation package scripts did not
  properly execute `systemctl daemon-reload` when moving/updating Sensu
  unit files. Daemon reload is now called appropriately when installing
  via RPM or DEB packages.

## Core 1.4.2 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#142---2018-05-10)

**May 10, 2018** — Sensu Core version 1.4.2 has been
released and is available for immediate download. Please note
the following improvements:

### CHANGES

* **SECURITY FIX**: Sensu’s directory permissions on Microsoft Windows
  platforms were overly permissive, making it possible for
  unprivileged users to execute code as the Sensu service user. This
  vulnerability is fixed in Sensu Core 1.4.2-3, released May
  31, 2018. Our thanks to Matt Bush with [The Missing
  Link](https://themissinglink.com.au/) for discovering and reporting
  this vulnerability.
* **BUGFIX**: Fixed API GET /results, results were incorrectly reported
  under a single client name.

## Core 1.4.1 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#141---2018-05-04)

**May 4, 2018** — Sensu Core version 1.4.1 has been
released and is available for immediate download. Please note
the following improvements:

### CHANGES

* **BUGFIX**: Now including em-http-request Ruby gem in runtime
  dependencies, fixing the 1.4 sensu-server.

## Core 1.4.0 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#140---2018-05-02)

**May 2, 2018** — Sensu Core version 1.4.0 has been
released and is available for immediate download. Please note
the following improvements:

### CHANGES

* **NEW**: Sensu call-home mechanism, the Tessen client (opt-in). It
  sends anonymized data about the Sensu installation to the Tessen
  hosted service (Sensu Inc), on sensu-server startup and every 6
  hours thereafter. All data reports are logged for
  transparency/awareness and transmitted over HTTPS. The anonymized
  data currently includes the flavour of Sensu (Core or Enterprise),
  the Sensu version, and the Sensu client and server counts.
* **NEW**: API list endpoints (e.g. /events) now all support
  pagination.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Support for writing multiple check results to the
  client socket (in one payload).
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Now updating event last\_ok when storing latest
  check results for better accuracy.
* **BUGFIX**: Include child process (e.g. check execution) stop
  (SIGTERM/KILL) error message in timeout output. This helps when
  debugging defunct/zombie processes, e.g. “Execution timed out -
  Unable to TERM/KILL the process: Operation not permitted”.

## Core 1.3.0 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#130----2018-03-09)

**April 12, 2018** — Sensu Core version 1.3.0 has been
released and is available for immediate download. Please note
the following improvements:

### CHANGES

* **NEW**: Redis TLS connection support. Sensu Redis connections can now
  be configured to use TLS, this includes the Sensu server and Redis
  transport connections! The Sensu Redis configuration definition
  now includes the optional “tls” (or “ssl”) attribute, a hash
  containing TLS options (“private\_key\_file”, “cert\_chain\_file”, and
  “verify\_peer”).
* **NEW**: The Sensu client TCP/UDP socket can now be disabled via
  configuration. The Sensu client configuration definition now
  includes the socket “enabled” attribute, which defaults to true,
  and it can be set to false in order to disable the socket. (#1799)
* **IMPROVEMENT**: The Sensu Ruby gems are now cryptographically signed.
  To learn more about Ruby gem signing, please refer to the RubyGems
  security guide. (#1819)
* **IMPROVEMENT**: The Sensu API POST /clients endpoint no longer
  requires client subscriptions to be specified. (#1795)
* **IMPROVEMENT**: All Sensu event handler types now include event ID in
  log events.
* **BUGFIX**: Sensu TCP event handlers will no longer connect to a socket
  if the provided event data is nil or empty. (#1734)
* **BUGFIX**: The RabbitMQ transport will now reconnect after failing to
  resolve DNS, instead of independently retrying broker hostname
  resolution. This fixes retry timer backoff and allows the
  transport to connect to another eligible broker after failing to
  resolve a hostname.

## Core 1.2.1 Release Notes

**February 9, 2018** — Sensu Core version 1.2.1 has been
released and is available for immediate download. Please note
the following improvements:

### CHANGES

* **SECURITY FIX**: Sensu’s configuration redaction function failed to
  handle key/value pairs in deeply nested data structures, resulting in
  sensitive configuration data (e.g. passwords) being logged in clear-text.
  The redaction function now handles the necessary recursion to address
  this vulnerability.

  This vulnerability is documented as [CVE-2018-1000060](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1000060).

## Core 1.2.0 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#120---2017-12-05)

**December 5, 2017** — Sensu Core version 1.2.0 has been
released and is available for immediate download. Please note
the following improvements:

### CHANGES

* **NEW**: Scheduled maintenance, Sensu now gives users the ability to
  silence a check and/or client subscriptions at a predetermined
  time (begin epoch timestamp), with an optional expiration (in
  seconds), enabling users to silence events in advance for
  scheduled maintenance windows.
* **NEW**: The Sensu API now logs the “X-Request-ID” header, making it
  much easier to trace a request/response. If the API client does
  not provide a request ID, the API generates one for the request
  (UUID).
* **IMPROVEMENT**: The Sensu API /results/\* endpoints now include check
  history in the result data.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Check token substitution is now supported in check
  “subdue”.

## Core 1.1.3 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#113---2017-11-24)

### CHANGES

* **BUGFIX**: Fixed a bug in the Sensu client that broke check hooks
  named after numeric statuses (e.g. “2”) and “non-zero”, they were
  never executed unless the client had a local check definition.
  (#1773)
* **BUGFIX**: systemd units now stored in /lib/systemd instead of
  /usr/lib/systemd on Debian and Ubuntu systems. (sensu-omnibus
  #240)
* **BUGFIX**: Sensu processes once again honor service-specific
  defaults in /etc/default or /etc/sysconfig (sensu-omnibus #226)
* **BUGFIX**: Package scripts now use `getent` for user/group
  verification (sensu-omnibus #237)
* **BUGFIX**: Removing AIX package no longer fails when sensu-client
  isn’t running. (sensu-omnibus #243)

## Core 1.1.2 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#112---2017-10-27)

### CHANGES

* **BUGFIX**: Fixed a bug in the Sensu client HTTP socket that caused
  the Sensu client to crash when the the local client definition did
  not specify `"http_socket"` settings and the `/info` or `/results`
  endpoints were accessed.
* **BUGFIX**: Fixed a bug in the Sensu client HTTP socket that caused
  the Sensu client to consider an HTTP content-type that included
  media-type information as invalid, discarding possibly valid
  content.

## Core 1.1.1 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#111---2017-10-10)

### CHANGES

* **BUGFIX**: Fixed a bug in check TTL monitoring that caused the
  Sensu server to crash. Check TTL member deletion, following the
  deletion of the associated check result, would produce an uncaught
  error.

## Core 1.1.0 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#110---2017-09-27)

**September, 27 2017** — Sensu Core version 1.1.0 has been released
and is available for immediate download. Please note the following
improvements:

### CHANGES

* **IMPORTANT**: Sensu packages include Ruby 2.4.1. Upgrading from
  releases of Sensu prior to 1.0.0 will require all plugin or
  extension gems to be re-installed under the new Ruby environment.
* **IMPORTANT**: Sensu packages include [sensu-plugin 2.0.0](https://github.com/sensu-plugins/sensu-plugin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v200---2017-03-29), which
  disables its deprecated filter methods by default, i.e.
  occurrences. Sensu releases since 1.0.0 include built-in filters
  that provide the same functionality with several improvements. The
  built-in filters are [“occurrences”](https://github.com/sensu-extensions/sensu-extensions-occurrences) and
  [“check\_dependencies”](https://github.com/sensu-extensions/sensu-extensions-check-dependencies). To use the built-in filters, apply them
  to Sensu event handlers via their definition `"filters"`
  attribute, e.g. `"filters": ["occurrences", "check_dependencies"]`. These filters can now be used with Sensu
  event handlers that do not use the sensu-plugin library (or Ruby).
* **NEW**: Check hooks, commands run by the Sensu client in response to
  the result of the check command execution. The Sensu client will
  execute the appropriate configured hook command, depending on the
  check execution status (e.g. 1). Valid hook names include (in
  order of precedence): “1”-“255”, “ok”, “warning”, “critical”,
  “unknown”, and “non-zero”. The check hook command output, status,
  executed timestamp, and duration are captured and published in the
  check result. Check hook commands can optionally receive JSON
  serialized Sensu client and check definition data via STDIN.
* **NEW**: Check STDIN. A boolean check definition attribute, “stdin”,
  when set to true instructs the Sensu client to write JSON
  serialized Sensu client and check definition data to the check
  command process STDIN. This attribute cannot be used with existing
  Sensu check plugins, nor Nagios plugins etc, as the Sensu client
  will wait indefinitely for the check process to read and close
  STDIN.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Splayed proxy check request publishing. Users can now
  splay proxy check requests (optional), evenly, over a window of
  time, determined by the check interval and a configurable splay
  coverage percentage. For example, if a check has an interval of
  60s and a configured splay coverage of 90%, its proxy check
  requests would be splayed evenly over a time window of 60s \* 90%,
  54s, leaving 6s for the last proxy check execution before the the
  next round of proxy check requests for the same check. Proxy check
  request splayed publishing can be configured with two new check
  definition attributes, within the proxy\_requests scope, splay
  (boolean) to enable it and splay\_coverage (integer percentage,
  defaults to 90).
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Configurable check output truncation (for storage in
  Redis). Check output truncation can be manually enabled/disabled
  with the check definition attribute “truncate\_output”,
  e.g.“truncate\_output”: false. The output truncation length can be
  configured with the check definition attribute
  “truncate\_output\_length”, e.g. “truncate\_output\_length”: 1024.
  Check output truncation is still enabled by default for metric
  checks, with “type”: “metric”.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Sensu client HTTP socket basic authentication can how
  be applied to all endpoints (not just /settings), via the client
  definition http\_socket attribute “protect\_all\_endpoints”, e.g.
  “protect\_all\_endpoints”: true.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Improved check TTL monitoring performance.
* **IMRPOVEMENT**: The Sensu extension run log event log level is now set
  to debug (instead of info) when the run output is empty and the
  status is 0.
* **BUGFIX**: Added initial timestamp to proxy client definitions. The
  Uchiwa and Sensu dashboards will no longer display “Invalid Date”.
* **BUGFIX**: Deleting check history when deleting an associated check result.

## Core 1.0.4 Release Notes

**October, 17 2017** — Sensu Core version 1.0.4 has been released
and is available for immediate download. Please note the following
improvements:

### CHANGES

* **DEBUG**: Added HTTP response body to sensu-api debug-level log
  messages. This is a temporary change, not included in
  future releases.

## Core 1.0.3 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#103---2017-08-25)

**August 25, 2017** — Sensu Core version 1.0.3 has been released
and is available for immediate download. Please note the following
improvements:

### CHANGES

* **BUGFIX**: Now using EventMachine version 1.2.5 in order to support larger EM
  timer intervals. EM timers are used by the Sensu check scheduler and many
  other Sensu components.

## Core 1.0.2 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#102---2017-07-27)

**July 27, 2017** — Sensu Core version 1.0.2 has been released
and is available for immediate download. Please note the following
improvements:

### CHANGES

* **BUGFIX**: Addressed an issue with client keepalive transport
  acknowledgments. We discovered a situation where poor Redis
  performance could negatively impact client keepalive processing,
  potentially triggering a compounding failure that the Sensu server
  is unable to recover from. Moving acknowledgments to the next tick
  of the EventMachine reactor avoids the situation entirely.

## Core 1.0.1 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#101---2017-07-24)

**July 24, 2017** — Sensu Core version 1.0.1 has been released
and is available for immediate download. Please note the following
improvements:

### CHANGES

* **BUGFIX**: Fixed Sensu configuration validation, it is now being
  applied. There was a bug that allowed invalid Sensu configuration
  definitions to be loaded, causing unexpected behaviours.
* **BUGFIX**: Now excluding certain file system directories from the Sensu
  RPM package spec, as they could cause conflicts with other RPM
  packages.

## Core 1.0.0 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#100---2017-07-11)

**July 11, 2017** — Sensu Core version 1.0.0 has been released
and is available for immediate download. Please note the following
improvements:

### CHANGES

* **IMPORTANT**: Sensu packages now include Ruby 2.4.1. Upgrading from
  prior versions of Sensu will require any plugin or extension gems
  to be re-installed under the new Ruby environment.
* **IMPORTANT**: Sensu packages now include [sensu-plugin 2.0.0](https://github.com/sensu-plugins/sensu-plugin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v200---2017-03-29), which
  disables its deprecated filter methods by default, i.e.
  occurrences. Sensu 1.0 includes built-in filters that provide the
  same functionality with several improvements. The built-in filters
  are [“occurrences”](https://github.com/sensu-extensions/sensu-extensions-occurrences) and [“check\_dependencies”](https://github.com/sensu-extensions/sensu-extensions-check-dependencies). To use the
  built-in filters, apply them to Sensu event handlers via their
  definition `"filters"` attribute, e.g. `"filters": ["occurrences", "check_dependencies"]`. These filters can now be used with Sensu
  event handlers that do not use the sensu-plugin library (or Ruby).
* **NEW**: Added Sensu API event endpoint alias “incidents”, e.g.
  /incidents, /incidents/:client/:check.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Improved Sensu client keepalive configuration
  validation, now including coverage for check low/high flap
  thresholds etc.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Improved Sensu client socket check result validation,
  now including coverage for check low/high flap thresholds etc.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: The sensu-install tool now notifies users when it is
  unable to successfully install an extension, when the environment
  variable EMBEDDED\_RUBY is set to false.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Added the Sensu RELEASE\_INFO constant, containing
  information about the Sensu release, used by the API /info
  endpoint and Server registration.
* **BUGFIX**: Sensu handler severities filtering now accounts for flapping
  events.
* **BUGFIX**: Fixed Sensu Redis connection on error reconnect, no longer
  reusing the existing EventMachine connection handler.

## Core 0.29.0 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0290---2017-03-29)

**April 7, 2017** — Sensu Core version 0.29.0 has been released
and is available for immediate download. Please note the following
improvements:

### CHANGES

* **IMPORTANT**: Sensu packages now include Ruby 2.4.1. Upgrading from
  prior versions of Sensu will require any plugin or extension gems
  to be re-installed under the new Ruby environment.
* **IMPORTANT**: Sensu packages now include [sensu-plugin 2.0.0](https://github.com/sensu-plugins/sensu-plugin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v200---2017-03-29), which
  disables its deprecated filter methods by default, i.e.
  occurrences. Sensu 0.29 includes built-in filters that provide the
  same functionality with several improvements. The built-in filters
  are [“occurrences”](https://github.com/sensu-extensions/sensu-extensions-occurrences) and [“check\_dependencies”](https://github.com/sensu-extensions/sensu-extensions-check-dependencies). To use the
  built-in filters, apply them to Sensu event handlers via their
  definition `"filters"` attribute, e.g. `"filters": ["occurrences", "check_dependencies"]`. These filters can now be used with Sensu
  event handlers that do not use the sensu-plugin library (or Ruby).
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Sensu server tasks, replacing the Sensu server leader
  functionality, distributing certain server responsibilities
  amongst the running Sensu servers. A server task can only run on
  one Sensu server at a time. Sensu servers partake in an election
  process to become responsible for one or more tasks. A task can
  failover to another Sensu server.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Sensu API response object filtering for any GET
  request. Filtering is done with one or more dot notation query
  parameters, beginning with `filter.`, to specify object attributes
  to filter by, e.g.
  `/events?filter.client.environment=production&filter.check.contact=ops`.
* **NEW**: Added API endpoint GET `/settings` to provided the APIs
  running configuration. Sensitive setting values are redacted by
  default, unless the query parameter `redacted` is set to `false`,
  e.g. `/settings?redacted=false`.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Added support for invalidating a Sensu client when
  deleting it via the Sensu API DELETE `/clients/:name` endpoint,
  disallowing further client keepalives and check results until the
  client is either successfully removed from the client registry or
  for a specified duration of time. To invalidate a Sensu client
  until it is deleted, the query parameter `invalidate` must be set
  to `true`, e.g. `/clients/app01.example.com?invalidate=true`. To
  invalidate the client for a certain amount of time (in seconds),
  the query parameter `invalidate_expire` must be set as well, e.g.
  `/clients/app01.example.com?invalidate=true&invalidate_expire=300`.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Added a Sensu settings hexdigest, exposed via the Sensu
  API GET `/info` endpoint, providing a means to determine if a
  Sensu server’s configuration differs from the rest.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Added a proxy argument to `sensu-install`. To use a
  proxy for Sensu plugin and extension installation with
  `sensu-install`, use the `-x` or `--proxy` argument, e.g.
  `sensu-install -e statsd --proxy http://proxy.example.com:8080`.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Added support for issuing proxy check requests via the
  Sensu API POST `/request` endpoint.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: The Sensu API now logs response times.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: The Sensu API now returns a 405 (Method Not Allowed)
  when an API endpoint does not support a HTTP request method, e.g.
  `PUT`, and sets the HTTP header “Allow” to indicate which HTTP
  request methods are supported by the requested endpoint.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Added a built-in filter for check dependencies,
  `check_dependencies`, which implements the check dependency
  filtering logic in the Sensu Plugin library.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Added default values for Sensu CLI options
  `config_file` (`"/etc/sensu/config.json"`) and `config_dirs`
  (`["/etc/sensu/conf.d"]`). These defaults are only applied when
  the associated file and/or directory exist.
* **BUGFIX**: The built-in filter `occurrences` now supports `refresh` for
  flapping events (action `flapping`).
* **BUGFIX**: Force the configured Redis port to be an integer, as some
  users make the mistake of using a string.

## Core 0.28.5 Release Notes

  scheduling drift has been removed.

## Core 0.28.3 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0283---2017-03-09)

**March 9, 2017** — Sensu Core version 0.28.3 has been released and
is available for immediate download. Please note the following
changes:

* **BUGFIX**: The Sensu client now includes check source when tracking in
  progress check executions. These changes are necessary to allow
  the Sensu client to execute on several concurrent proxy check
  requests.

## Core 0.28.2 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0282---2017-03-06)

**March 6, 2017** — Sensu Core version 0.28.2 has been released
and is available for immediate download. Please note the following
changes:

## Core 0.28.0 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0280---2017-02-23)

**February 23, 2017** — Sensu Core version 0.28.0 has been released
and is available for immediate download. Please note the following
improvements:

### CHANGES

* **IMPROVEMENT**: Added proxy check requests to improve Sensu’s ability
  to monitor external resources that have an associated Sensu proxy
  client. Publish a check request to the configured `subscribers`
  (e.g. `["round-robin:snmp_pollers"]`) for every Sensu client in
  the registry that matches the configured client attributes in
  `client_attributes` on the configured `interval` (e.g. `60`).
  Client tokens in the check definition (e.g. `"check-snmp-if.rb -h :::address::: -i eth0"`) are substituted prior to publishing the
  check request. The check request check source is set to the client
  name.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Schedule check requests and standalone executions with
  the Cron syntax.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Added the Sensu server registry, containing information
  about the running Sensu servers. Information about the Sensu
  servers is now accessible via the Sensu API /info endpoint.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Added two optional attributes to Sensu API POST
  /request, “reason” and “creator”, for additional context. The
  check request reason and creator are added to the check request
  payload under “api\_requested” and become part of the check result.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Added event IDs to event handler log events for
  additional context, making it easier to trace an event through the
  Sensu pipeline.
* **BUGFIX**: The Sensu interval timers, used for scheduling tasks, now
  account for drift. The check request and standalone execution
  scheduler timers are now more accurate.
* **BUGFIX**: Fixed a bug in the Sensu deep\_merge() method that was
  responsible for mutating arrays of the original provided objects.

## Core 0.27.1 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0271---2017-02-17)

**February 17, 2017** — Sensu Core version 0.27.1 has been released
and is available for immediate download. Please note the following
improvements:

### CHANGES

* **IMPROVEMENT**: Failed pipe handler executions are now logged with the
  error log level.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Sensu server now adds a unique per-client subscription to
  client keepalives when missing. This is to enable built-in event
  silencing for older Sensu clients (< 0.26).
* **BUGFIX**: Check subdue and filter when time windows now account for
  GMT offsets.
* **BUGFIX**: Non UTF-8 characters in check tokens are now removed.
* **BUGFIX**: Fixed filter name logging when an event is filtered.

## Core 0.27.0 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0270---2017-01-26)

**January 26, 2017** — Sensu Core version 0.27.0 has been released and is
available for immediate download. Please note the following improvements:

### IMPORTANT

This release includes potentially breaking, backwards-incompatible changes:

* **NEW**: Sensu is now packaged specifically for each supported platform
  version and architecture; previously, single packages were built
  for each platform and architecture using the oldest supported
  platform version. Accordingly, package repository structures have
  changed to support per-platform-version packages. See the
  [platforms page](/sensu-core/0.29/platforms) for links to updated installation instructions.
* **NEW**: On platforms where systemd is the default init, Sensu now
  provides systemd unit files instead of sysv init scripts.
* **NOTE**: The transition of service management from sysv to systemd may
  initially cause an error when restarting Sensu services. To
  avoid this, please be sure to stop Sensu services before
  upgrading to Sensu 0.27 and starting them again.
* **REMOVED**: The embedded runit service supervisor is no longer included
  in Sensu packages for Linux platforms.
* **REPLACED**: The [sensu-omnibus project](https://github.com/sensu/sensu-omnibus) has superseded sensu-build as
  the tool chain for building official Sensu packages. This project
  uses [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) to automate package builds using a combination of
  [Test Kitchen](https://github.com/test-kitchen/test-kitchen), [Chef](https://github.com/chef/chef) and [Omnibus](https://github.com/chef/omnibus) tools.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Sensu packages for Windows now include Ruby 2.3.0,
  upgraded from Ruby 2.0.0 in prior versions of Sensu.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Sensu packages for Windows now include winsw 2.0.1,
  upgraded from winsw 1.16. This version includes a number of changes
  which should help to address issues around orphaned processes.
* **CHANGED**: The CONFIG\_DIR environment variable has been renamed to
  CONFD\_DIR. This environment varible is used to specify the
  directory path where Sensu processes will load any JSON
  config files for deep merging. If you are using
  /etc/default/sensu to specify a custom value for
  `CONFIG_DIR`, please update it to the new `CONFD_DIR`
  variable name.

### CHANGES

* **NEW**: Added a Sensu client HTTP socket for check result input and
  informational queries. The client HTTP socket provides several
  endpoints, `/info`, `/results`, and `/settings`. Basic
  authentication is supported, which is required for certain
  endpoints, i.e. `/settings`. The client HTTP socket is
  configurable via the Sensu client definition, `"http_socket": {}`.
* **NEW**: Added API endpoint `/silenced/ids/:id` for fetching a silence
  entry by ID.
* **NEW**: Added check attribute `ttl_status`, allowing checks to set a
  different TTL event check status (default is `1` warning).
* **NEW**: Added client deregistration attribute `status`, allowing clients
  to set a different event check status for their deregistration
  events (default is `1` warning).
* **NEW**: Added Rubygems cleanup support to `sensu-install`, via the
  command line argument `-c` or `--clean` when installing one or
  more plugins and/or extensions. If a version is provided for the
  plugin(s) or extension(s), all other installed versions of them
  will be removed, e.g. `sensu-install -e snmp-trap:0.0.23 -c`. If a
  version is not provided, all installed versions except the latest
  will be removed.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Hostnames are now resolved prior to making connection
  attempts, this applies to the Sensu Transport (i.e. RabbitMQ) and
  Redis connections. This allows Sensu to handle resolution failures
  and enables failover via DNS and services like Amazon AWS
  ElastiCache.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Added the filter name to event filtered log events.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Check TTL events now have the check interval overridden
  to the TTL monitoring interval, this change allows event
  occurrence filtering to work as expected.
* **BUGFIX**: Silenced resolution events with silencing
  `"expire_on_resolve": true` are now handled.

## Core 0.26.5 Release Notes

## Core 0.26.0 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0260---2016-09-06)

**August 24, 2016** — Sensu Core version 0.26.0 has been released and is
available for immediate download. Please note the following improvements:

### IMPORTANT

This release includes potentially breaking, backwards-incompatible changes:

* Event silencing is now built into Sensu Core, and a new `/silenced` API
  is now available. A new [`"handle_silenced": true` attribute](/sensu-core/0.29/reference/handlers#handler-attributes) is
  available to opt-out of this new built-in silencing functionality on a
  per-handler basis.
* **NEW**: Every Sensu client now creates and subscribes to a unique client
  subscription (e.g. `client:i-424242`). Unique client subscriptions are
  required for silencing one or more checks on a single client (host)
  **Fixes: [#1327](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/issues/1327)**.
* Sensu Core version 0.26 requires Uchiwa version 0.18 or newer in order
  to make use of the new `/silenced` API feature. Prior versions of Uchiwa
  silence events using the “silence stashes” pattern, which will be honored by
  existing handlers until the now-deprecated event filtering is removed
  from a future version of sensu-plugin.

  *NOTE: The new `/silenced` API and native event silencing features are
  intended to replace the “silence stash” pattern implemented in the
  `sensu-plugin` library and widely used by existing handlers. This
  “silence stashes” pattern is considered deprecated. Sensu 0.26 includes
  version 1.4.2 of the `sensu-plugin` library which continues to
  apply this pattern by default, but will log deprecation warnings as
  well. Set the check attribute `enable_deprecated_filtering: false` to
  disable the deprecated filtering behavior. Please refer to the
  [Deprecating Event Filtering in sensu-plugin](https://blog.sensu.io/deprecating-event-filtering-in-sensu-plugin-b60c7c500be3) blog post for more
  information.*
* The handler definition `subdue` attribute is no longer supported. Time-based
  filtering is now supported by the new [filter `when` attribute](/sensu-core/0.29/reference/filters#when-attributes). Please
  update your handler definitions accordingly.
* Check `subdue` definitions no longer support the `"at": "handler"`
  configuration setting.

### CHANGES

* **NEW**: Event silencing is now built into Sensu Core! The Sensu API now
  provides a set of [`/silenced` endpoints](/sensu-core/0.29/api/silenced), for silencing one or more
  checks and/or subscriptions (including the NEW client-specific subscriptions,
  above). Silencing applies to all event handlers by default, however a new
  `handle_silenced` handler definition attribute can be used to disable this
  functionality. Metric check events (OK) bypass event silencing.

  *NOTE: this improvement is very closely related to the impending removal
  of event filtering in the `sensu-plugin` gem. See the recent [Deprecating
  Event Filtering in sensu-plugin](https://blog.sensu.io/deprecating-event-filtering-in-sensu-plugin-b60c7c500be3) blog post for more information.*
* **NEW**: Introducing **Subdue 2.0**! Sensu `subdue` rules have a brand new
  configuration syntax, adding support for a broader number of applications, and
  `subdue` definitions are now supported by standalone checks.

  By way of comparison, the legacy `subdue` definition specification was
  limited to a single time window rule, with an array of exceptions. This was
  not only confusing, it made it very difficult to apply a simple “don’t execute
  this check outside of 9-5, M-F” rule.

  ```
    {
      "checks": {
        "example_check": {
          "command": "check_something.rb",
          "...": "...",
          "subdue": {
            "begin": "12:00:00 AM",
            "end": "11:59:00 PM",
            "days": ["monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday"],
            "exceptions": [
              {
                "begin": "9:00:00 AM",
                "end": "5:00:00 PM"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }

  ```

  The new syntax is more verbose, but by doing away with the need for
  `exceptions` and adding support for defining an array of subdue time windows,
  it is much easier to configure.

  ```
    {
      "checks": {
        "example_check": {
          "command": "check_something.rb",
          "...": "...",

                {
                  "begin": "12:00:00 AM PST",

            }
          }
        }
      }
    }

  ```

  *NOTE: Subdue rules now apply to check publishing, **ONLY** (i.e. `subdue`
  definitions no longer support the `"at": "handler"` definition attribute,
  among other changes). Prior to this release, `subdue` rules could be provided
  via [check definition `subdue` attribute](/sensu-core/0.29/reference/checks#subdue-attributes) (i.e. `"at": "publisher"`) or the
  [handler definition `subdue` attribute](/sensu-core/0.29/reference/handlers#subdue-attributes) (i.e. `"at": "handler"`).
  Time-based filtering for handlers is now provided by Sensu filters (see
  below). Please refer to the new [`subdue` reference documentation](/sensu-core/0.29/reference/checks#subdue-attributes) for more
  information.* **See: [#1415](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/pull/1415)**.
* **NEW**: Event filters now support time-based rules, via a new `"when": {}`
  filter definition attribute. The filter `when` specification uses the same
  syntax as the new Subdue 2.0 specification, simplifying time-based event
  filtering. Please refer to the [filer `when` reference documentation](/sensu-core/0.29/reference/filters#when-attributes) for
  more information. **See [#1415](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/pull/1415)**.
* **NEW**: Sensu Extensions can now be loaded from Rubygems and enabled/disabled
  via configuration! The `sensu-install` has also added support for installing
  Sensu Extensions (e.g. `sensu-install -e system-profile`). Extensions gems
  must be enabled via configuration, please refer to the [Sensu extension
  reference documentation](/sensu-core/0.29/reference/extensions) for more information. **See: [#1394](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/pull/1394)**.
* **NEW**: A check can now be a member of more than one [named aggregate](/sensu-core/0.29/reference/aggregates),
  via a new check definition `"aggregates": []` attribute. **See: [#1379](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/pull/1379);
  fixes [#1342](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/issues/1342)**.
* **NEW**: Added support for setting Redis Sentinel configuration via a new
  `REDIS_SENTINEL_URLS` environment variable. Please refer to the [Sensu
  environment variables reference documentation](/sensu-core/0.29/reference/configuration#sensu-environment-variables) for more information. \*\*See
  [#1411](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/pull/1411); fixes [#1361](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/issues/1361).
* **NEW**: Added support for automatically discovering and setting client `name`
  and `address` attributes (two of the few required attributes for a valid
  Sensu client definition). **See: [#1379](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/pull/1379); fixes [#1362](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/issues/1362)**.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Added support for a new `occurrences_watermark` attribute,
  which is used by the built-in [sensu-occurrences-extension](https://github.com/sensu-extensions/sensu-extensions-occurrences/) filter to
  prevent sending resolve notifications for events that were not handled due to
  occurrence filtering. **See: [#1419](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/pull/1419) and [#1427](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/pull/1427)**.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Only attempt to schedule standalone checks that have an
  interval. **See: [#1384](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/pull/1384); fixes [#1286](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/issues/1286)**.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Locally configured standalone checks (e.g. on a Sensu server)
  are no longer accessible via the Sensu API `/checks` endpoint. **See:
  [#1417](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/pull/1417); fixes [#1416](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/issues/1416)**.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Check TTL events are no longer created if the associated
  Sensu client has a current keepalive event. **See [#1428](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/pull/1428); fixes [#861](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/issues/861)
  and [#1282](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/issues/1282)**.
* **IMPROVEMENT**: Increased the maximum number of EventMachine timers from 100k
  to 200k, to accommodate very large Sensu installations that execute over 100k
  checks. **See [#1370](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/pull/1370); fixes [#1368](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/issues/1368)**.
* **BUGFIX**: Fixed a Sensu API `/results` endpoint race condition that
  caused incomplete response content. **See [#1372](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/pull/1372); fixes [#1356][-i1356]**.

## Core 0.25.0 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0250---2016-06-13)

**June 13, 2016** — Sensu Core version 0.25.0 has been released and is
available for immediate download. Please note the following improvements:

### IMPORTANT

This release includes potentially breaking, backwards-incompatible changes:

* The legacy/deprecated Sensu API singular resources (e.g. `/check/:check_name`
  instead of `/checks/:check_name`), have been removed. Singular resources were
  never documented and have not been used by most community tooling (e.g.
  Uchiwa) since the very early Sensu releases (circa 2011-2012).

### CHANGES

* **NEW**: [Built-in client de-registration](/sensu-core/0.29/reference/clients#deregistration-attributes). Sensu client de-registration on
  graceful `sensu-client` process stop is now supported by the Sensu client
  itself (no longer depending on the package init script). The package init
  script-based de-registration functionality still remains, but is considered to
  be deprecated at this time and will be removed in a future release.

  Please note the following example client definition which enables built-in
  client de-registration (via the new client `deregister` definition attribute),
  and sets the deregistration event handler to `deregister_client` (via the new
  client `deregistration` definition attribute):

  ```
    {
      "client": {
        "name": "i-424242",
        "address": "8.8.8.8",
        "subscriptions": [
          "production",
          "webserver",
          "mysql"
        ],
        "deregister": true,
        "deregistration": {
          "handler": "deregister_client"
        },
        "socket": {
          "bind": "127.0.0.1",
          "port": 3030
        }
      }
    }

  ```

Please refer to the [Sensu client reference documentation](/sensu-core/0.29/reference/clients#deregistration-attributes) for additional
information on configuring the built-in Sensu client de-registration.
**Fixes [#1191](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/pull/1191), [#1305](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/pull/1305).**

* **NEW**: The Sensu API has been rewritten to use [EM HTTP Server](https://github.com/alor/em-http-server), removing
  Rack and Thin as API runtime dependencies. The API no longer uses Rack async,
  making for cleaner HTTP request logic and much improved HTTP request and
  response logging. **Fixes [#1317](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/issues/1317).**
* **BUGFIX**: Fixed a critical bug in Sensu client `execute_check_command()`
  where a check result would contain a check command with client tokens
  substituted, potentially exposing sensitive/redacted client attribute values.

## Core 0.24.1 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0241---2016-06-07)

**June 7, 2016** — Sensu Core version 0.24.1 has been released and is
available for immediate download. Please note the following improvements:

* **BUGFIX:** Fixed a critical bug in Sensu server `resume()` which caused the
  server to crash when querying the state of the Sensu Transport connection
  before it had been initialized. **Resolves [#1321](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/issues/1321).**
* **IMPROVEMENT:** Updated references to unmatched tokens, i.e. check result
  output message, to better represent the new scope of token substitution.
  **Resolves [#1322](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/issues/1322).**

## Core 0.24.0 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0240---2016-06-06)

**June 6, 2016** — Sensu Core version 0.24.0 has been released and is
available for immediate download. Please note the following improvements:

### IMPORTANT

This release includes potentially breaking, backwards-incompatible changes:

* Sensu [check aggregates](/sensu-core/0.29/reference/aggregates) have been completely redesigned. Users who are
  using check aggregates may need to review these changes before upgrading.
  [Uchiwa](https://uchiwa.io/) users should install version 0.15 or higher before upgrading to
  Sensu Core version 0.24.0. See below for additional information.
* Sensu [event `id`s](/sensu-core/0.29/reference/events#event-data-specification) are no longer unique to each occurrence of an event.
  Event `id`s are now persistent for the duration of an event (per client/check
  pair), until the event is resolved. See below for additional information.
* The Sensu [/health (GET) API endpoint](/sensu-core/0.29/api/health-and-info#health-get) has been updated such that failed
  health checks now respond with an [`412 (Precondition Failed)` HTTP response
  code](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.13) instead of a [`503 (Service Unavailable)` response code](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.5.4).
  Third-party services and/or custom scripts may need to be updated accordingly.
* The Sensu services and corresponding service management scripts have been
  updated to use the new `--validate_config` command line option which uses
  strong configuration validation (i.e. do not start if configuration is in an
  invalid state). See below for additional information.

### CHANGES

* **NEW:** Named aggregates. Check [aggregates 2.0](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/issues/1218) are here! At long last,
  Sensu [check aggregates](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/issues/1218) have been updated to support standalone checks, as
  well as a number of new use cases. Please refer to the [check aggregates
  reference documentation](https://uchiwa.io/) for additional information. **Resolves [#803](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/issues/803),
  [#915](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/issues/915), [#1041](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/issues/1041), [#1070](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/issues/1070), [#1187](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/issues/1187), and [#1218](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/issues/1218).**
* **NEW:** Persistent [event IDs](/sensu-core/0.29/reference/events#event-data-specification). Event occurrences for a client/check pair
  will now have the same event ID until the event is resolved (instead of a
  unique event ID for each occurrence of an event). Please refer to the [Event
  specification reference documentation](/sensu-core/0.29/reference/events#event-data-specification) for additional information.
  **Resolves [#1196](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/issues/1196).**
* **NEW:** Strong configuration validation. Added a new `--validate_config` CLI
  option/argument to cause Sensu to validate configuration settings and exit
  with the appropriate exit code (e.g. `2` for invalid). This feature is now
  used when restarting a Sensu service to first validate the new configuration
  before stopping the running service (i.e. to prevent restarts if the
  configuration is invalid). Please refer to the [Sensu service command line
  interface reference documentation](/sensu-core/0.29/reference/configuration#sensu-command-line-interfaces-and-arguments) for additional information. **Resolves
  [#1244](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/issues/1244), [#1254](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/issues/1254).**
* **NEW:** Proxy check origins. Events for [proxy clients](/sensu-core/0.29/reference/clients#proxy-clients) will now have a
  check `origin` attribute, set to the client name of the result producer.
  Please refer to the [Event data specification reference documentation](/sensu-core/0.29/reference/events#check-attributes) for
  additional information. **Resolves [#1075](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/issues/1075).**
* **NEW:** Improved Sensu check token substitution. Sensu [check token
  substitution](/sensu-core/0.29/reference/checks#check-token-substitution) is now supported in every check definition attribute value
  (no longer just the check `command` attribute). Please refer to the [check
  token substitution reference documentation](/sensu-core/0.29/reference/checks#check-token-substitution) for additional information.
  **Resolves [#1281](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/issues/1281).**
* **NEW:** Sensu `/clients (POST)` API endpoint can now create clients in the
  client registry that are expected to produce keepalives, and validates clients
  with the Sensu Settings client definition validator. A new [check `keepalives`
  attribute](/sensu-core/0.29/reference/clients#client-definition-specification) called has also been added, which allows client keepalives to
  be disabled on a per-client basis. **Resolves [#1203](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/issues/1203).**
* **IMPROVEMENT:** Configurable Sensu Spawn concurrent child process limit
  (checks, mutators, & pipe handlers). The default limit is still 12 and the
  EventMachine threadpool size is automatically adjusted to accommodate a larger
  limit. **Resolves [#1002](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/issues/1002).**
* **IMPROVEMENT:** Event data check type now explicitly defaults to `standard`.
  **Resolves [#1025](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/issues/1025).**
* **IMPROVEMENT:** Improved tracking of in progress check result processing,
  eliminates the potential for losing check results when restarting the Sensu
  server service. **Resolves [#1165](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/issues/1165).**
* **IMPROVEMENT:** Updated [Thin](https://github.com/macournoyer/thin/) (used by Sensu API) to the latest release,
  version 1.6.4. **Resolves [#1122](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/issues/1122).**
* **IMPROVEMENT:** [JrJackson](https://github.com/guyboertje/jrjackson) is now used to parse JSON when Sensu is
  running on JRuby.
* **IMPROVEMENT:** The Sensu API now listens immediately on service start, even
  before it has successfully connected to Redis and the Sensu Transport. It will
  now respond with a `500 (Internal Server Error)` HTTP response code and a
  descriptive error message when it has not yet initialized its connections or
  it is reconnecting to either Redis or the Sensu Transport. The [Health and
  Info API](/sensu-core/0.29/api/health-and-info) endpoints will still respond normally while reconnecting.
  **Resolves [#1215](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/issues/1215).**

## Core 0.23.2 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0232---2016-04-25)

**April 25, 2016** — Sensu Core version 0.23.2 has been released and is
available for immediate download. Please note the following improvements:

* **IMPROVEMENT:** fixed client socket check result publishing when the client
  has a signature. The client signature is now added to the check result payload,
  making it valid (see: [#1182](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/issues/1182)).

## Core 0.23.1 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0231---2016-04-15)

**April 15, 2016** — Sensu Core version 0.23.1 has been released and is
available for immediate download. Please note the following improvements:

* **NEW:** a pure-Ruby EventMachine reactor is used when running on Solaris.

## Core 0.23.0 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0230---2016-04-04)

**April 4, 2016** — Sensu Core version 0.23.0 has been released and is
available for immediate download. Please note the following improvements:

* **NEW:** dropped support for Rubies < 2.0.0, as they have long been EOL
  and have proven to be a hindrance and security risk.
* **NEW:** the Sensu 0.23 packages use [Ruby 2.3](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2015/12/25/ruby-2-3-0-released/).
* **NEW:** native support for [Redis Sentinel](https://redis.io/topics/sentinel). Sensu services can now be
  configured to query one or more instances of Redis Sentinel for a Redis
  master. This feature eliminates the last need for load balancing middleware
  (e.g. HAProxy) in highly available Sensu configurations. To configure Sensu
  services to use Redis Sentinel, hosts and ports of one or more Sentinel
  instances must be provided.

  Example Redis Sentinel configuration:

  ```
    {
      "sentinels": [
        {
          "host": "10.0.1.23",
          "port": 26479
        }
      ]
    }

  ```

  See the [Redis configuration documentation](/sensu-core/0.29/reference/redis#redis-high-availability-configuration) for more information.
* **NEW:** Added a CLI option/argument to cause the Sensu service to print
  (output to STDOUT) its compiled configuration settings and exit. The CLI
  option is `--print_config` or `-P`.

  See the [Sensu CLI arguments](/sensu-core/0.29/reference/configuration#sensu-command-line-interfaces-and-arguments) documentation for more information.
* **NEW:** Added token substitution to filter eval attributes, providing
  access to event data.

  Example filter eval token:

  ```
    {
      "filters": {
        "example_filter": {
          "attributes": {
            "occurrences": "eval: value > :::check.occurrences:::"
          }
        }
      }
    }

  ```
* **NEW:** native installer packages are now available for IBM AIX systems
  (sensu-client only).
* **NEW:** The pure Ruby EventMachine reactor is used when running on AIX.
* **IMPROVEMENT:** The Sensu Transport API has changed. Transports are now a
  deferrable, they must call `succeed()` once they have fully initialized. Sensu
  now waits for its transport to fully initialize before taking other actions.
* **IMPROVEMENT:** performance improvements. Dropped MultiJson in favour of
  Sensu JSON, a lighter weight JSON parser abstraction that supports platform
  specific parsers for Sensu Core and Enterprise. The Oj JSON parser is
  once again used for Sensu Core. Used [fast-ruby](https://github.com/JuanitoFatas/fast-ruby) and benchmarks as a guide
  to further changes.
* **IMPROVEMENT:** Using EventMachine 1.2.0, which brings several changes and
  improvements ([changelog](https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1201-march-15-2016)).

## 0.22.2 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0222---2016-03-16)

**March 16, 2016** — Sensu Core version 0.22.2 has been released and is
available for immediate download. Please note the following improvements:

* **BUGFIX:** FFI library loading no longer causes a load error on AIX &
  Solaris.
* Removed unused cruft from extension API `run()` and `safe_run()`. Optional
  `options={}` was never implemented in Sensu Core and event data `dup()` never
  provided the necessary protection that it claimed (only top level hash
  object).

## 0.22.1 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0221---2016-03-01)

**March 01, 2016** — Sensu Core version 0.22.1 has been released and is
available for immediate download. Please note the following improvements:

* Performance improvements. Using frozen constants for common values and
  comparisons. Reduced the use of block arguments for callbacks.
* Improved RabbitMQ transport channel error handling.
* Fixed client signatures inspection/comparison when upgrading from a previous
  release.

## 0.22.0 Release Notes

Source: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/sensu/sensu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0220---2016-01-29)

**January 29, 2016** — Sensu Core version 0.22.0 has been released and is
available for immediate download. Please note the following improvements:

* **NEW:** Client registration events are optionally created and processed
  (handled, etc.) when a client is first added to the client registry. To enable
  this functionality, configure a `"registration"` handler definition on Sensu
  server(s), or define a client specific registration handler in the client
  definition, e.g. `{"client": "registration": {"handler": "debug"}}`.
* **NEW:** Client auto de-registration on sensu-client process stop is now
  supported by the Sensu package init script. Setting
  `CLIENT_DEREGISTER_ON_STOP=true` and `CLIENT_DEREGISTER_HANDLER=example` in
  `/etc/default/sensu` will cause the Sensu client to publish a check result to
  trigger the event handler named `"example"`, before its process stops.
* **NEW:** Added support for Sensu client signatures, used to sign client
  keepalive and check result transport messages, for the purposes of source
  (publisher) verification. The client definition attribute `"signature"` is used
  to set the client signature, e.g. `"signature": "6zvyb8lm7fxcs7yw"`. A client
  signature can only be set once, the client must be deleted from the registry
  before its signature can be changed or removed. Client keepalives and check
  results that are not signed with the correct signature are logged (warn) and
  discarded. This feature is NOT a replacement for existing and proven security
  measures.
* **NEW:** The Sensu plugin installation tool, `sensu-install`, will no longer
  install a plugin if a or specified version has already been installed.
* **NEW:** The Sensu client socket now supports UTF-8 encoding.
