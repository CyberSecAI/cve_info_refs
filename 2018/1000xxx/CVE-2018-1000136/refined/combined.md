# Webview Vulnerability Fix

March 21, 2018 Â· 2 min read[![ckerr](https://github.com/ckerr.png?size=96)](https://github.com/ckerr)[ckerr](https://github.com/ckerr)

A vulnerability has been discovered which allows Node.js integration to be re-enabled in some Electron applications that disable it. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2018-1000136](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1000136).

---

## Affected Applications[â](#affected-applications "Direct link to Affected Applications")

An application is affected if *all* of the following are true:

1. Runs on Electron 1.7, 1.8, or a 2.0.0-beta
2. Allows execution of arbitrary remote code
3. Disables Node.js integration
4. Does not explicitly declare `webviewTag: false` in its webPreferences
5. Does not enable the `nativeWindowOption` option
6. Does not intercept `new-window` events and manually override `event.newGuest` without using the supplied options tag

Although this appears to be a minority of Electron applicatons, we encourage all applications to be upgraded as a precaution.

## Mitigation[â](#mitigation "Direct link to Mitigation")

This vulnerability is fixed in today's [1.7.13](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/tag/v1.7.13), [1.8.4](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/tag/v1.8.4), and [2.0.0-beta.5](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta.5) releases.

Developers who are unable to upgrade their application's Electron version can mitigate the vulnerability with the following code:

```
app.on('web-contents-created', (event, win) => {
  win.on(
    'new-window',
    (event, newURL, frameName, disposition, options, additionalFeatures) => {
      if (!options.webPreferences) options.webPreferences = {};
      options.webPreferences.nodeIntegration = false;
      options.webPreferences.nodeIntegrationInWorker = false;
      options.webPreferences.webviewTag = false;
      delete options.webPreferences.preload;
    },
  );
});

// and *IF* you don't use WebViews at all,
// you might also want
app.on('web-contents-created', (event, win) => {
  win.on('will-attach-webview', (event, webPreferences, params) => {
    event.preventDefault();
  });
});

```
## Further Information[â](#further-information "Direct link to Further Information")

This vulnerability was found and reported responsibly to the Electron project by Brendan Scarvell of [Trustwave SpiderLabs](https://www.trustwave.com/Company/SpiderLabs/).
