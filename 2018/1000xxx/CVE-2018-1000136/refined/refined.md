Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-1000136:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of `webview` tags and their associated settings within Electron applications. Specifically, it involves the ability to re-enable Node.js integration in certain scenarios even when it was explicitly disabled by the application developer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inconsistent Webview Configuration:** Electron applications that disable Node.js integration may inadvertently re-enable it within `webview` tags if specific configurations are not explicitly set. This is due to the default behavior of `webview` tags.
*   **Missing Security Controls:** The vulnerability manifests in applications that do not explicitly set `webviewTag: false` in `webPreferences` and don't prevent `webview` creation using `will-attach-webview` event.  Also, not intercepting `new-window` events and overriding `event.newGuest` without using the supplied options tag.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the Electron application. This can lead to a wide range of malicious activities, including data theft, system compromise, and more.
*   **Bypassing Intended Security Measures:** This vulnerability undermines the security intention of disabling Node.js integration, leading to potential privilege escalation or other unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** The vulnerability is exploitable in Electron applications that allow execution of arbitrary remote code. This means an attacker can inject malicious code that leverages the vulnerability.
*   **Abuse of Webview Tags:** Attackers can potentially exploit the vulnerability via a malicious web page or by exploiting other vulnerabilities that allow them to control the contents of a webview.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Inject Arbitrary Remote Code:** The attacker needs to be able to execute arbitrary remote code within the Electron application. This could be achieved through various methods, such as exploiting a separate vulnerability in the application, or injecting malicious code through a network attack or a cross-site scripting vulnerability.
*   **Target Application Specifics:** The target application has to meet the specific conditions to be exploitable, as the vulnerability only exists when the application runs on Electron versions 1.7, 1.8, or 2.0.0-beta, disables Node.js integration, allows execution of arbitrary remote code, does not explicitly set `webviewTag: false`, does not enable the `nativeWindowOption`, and does not intercept `new-window` events and manually override `event.newGuest`.

**Additional Notes**
* The provided content includes a code snippet showing how developers can mitigate this vulnerability by intercepting `new-window` and `will-attach-webview` events to disable node integration for new windows and prevent webview creation.
