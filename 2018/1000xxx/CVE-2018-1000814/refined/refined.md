Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2018-1000814:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper session expiration handling in `aiohttp-session` when using storage mechanisms that lack inherent expiration capabilities, specifically:
    * `EncryptedCookieStorage`
    * `NaClCookieStorage`
The session data was not being validated for expiration based on a `max_age` setting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Session Expiration Enforcement:** The session storages mentioned above were not actively enforcing the `max_age` timeout.  While the `max_age` parameter was available to configure the session, it was not being used to validate session validity server-side.
*   **Replay Attack Vulnerability:** An attacker could capture a valid session cookie, and even after the intended expiration time (max_age), reuse it to gain access by simply replaying the cookie.  This leads to indefinite session lifespan, greatly increasing the attack window.
*  **Inconsistency with 'idle timeout' behavior:**  The `max_age` was originally intended to function as an idle timeout before v2.7.0, but this change makes it a hard timeout, and combined with not updating `created_time` after resetting session content, could lead to unexpected session expiration after a login.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Extended Attack Window:** By replaying valid session cookies, attackers could bypass session expiration, gaining unauthorized access for prolonged periods.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could potentially maintain access to user accounts even after the expected session timeout, enabling them to perform actions on the user's behalf.
*   **Bypass Security Controls:** The vulnerability undermines the intended session timeout mechanism.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Cookie Replay:** An attacker intercepts a valid session cookie from a legitimate user. The attacker then reuses that cookie, potentially after the `max_age` has elapsed, to impersonate the user and gain access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Sniffing/Interception:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept network traffic to obtain a valid session cookie.
*   **Ability to Manipulate Cookies:** The attacker must be capable of adding the captured cookie to requests.

**Additional Notes:**

* The fix implemented uses the `ttl` (time-to-live) option of the Fernet library to ensure that the session data is actually expired server-side based on its age.
* For `NaClCookieStorage`, the fix added the creation time within the message, so the server could check it during session loading.
* The fix is retroactive, meaning already created sessions will be handled properly, and secret key rotation is not needed.
* There was a regression where the `created_time` was not being updated, which would result in a session immediately expiring if the application does not recreate the session manually after login.
