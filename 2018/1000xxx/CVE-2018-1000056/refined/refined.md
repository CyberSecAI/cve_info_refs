CVE-2018-1000056: XXE vulnerability in JUnit plugin

- Root cause: The JUnit plugin is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) processing.
- Weakness: The plugin parses XML files without properly disabling external entity resolution.
- Impact: An attacker can configure build processes to parse a maliciously crafted file that uses external entities. This can lead to:
  - Extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller
  - Server-side request forgery (SSRF)
  - Denial-of-service attacks
- Attack vector: By configuring a build process to parse a malicious XML file.
- Required capabilities: An attacker needs to be able to configure build processes.
