The provided content is related to CVE-2018-1000091.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A buffer overflow exists in the `ext-cmd.c` file of the KadNode project. Specifically, the issue occurs when handling user-provided input to the `kadnode-ctl` command.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer Overflow: The vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow where a user can supply an input longer than the allocated buffer, leading to memory corruption.
- Lack of input validation: The program fails to properly validate the length of the input provided to `kadnode-ctl`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Control of execution flow: An attacker can overwrite the EIP (Extended Instruction Pointer) register, effectively taking control of the program's execution flow and potentially executing arbitrary code.
- SIGSEGV Crash: The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates the program will crash (segmentation fault) due to an attempted access to invalid memory location when the execution pointer is overwritten.

**Attack vectors:**
- Command-line argument: The overflow is triggered by providing a long string as an argument to the `kadnode-ctl` command.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to execute the `kadnode-ctl` command, typically via command-line access or an interface that allows for such commands to be invoked.
- The attacker must be able to control the input parameters passed to this command.
