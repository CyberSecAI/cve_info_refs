The content is related to CVE-2018-1000854.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `esi:include` tag in ESIGate supports the `stylesheet` attribute, which can be a remote XSLT. This allows an attacker to execute code on the remote server by inserting malicious commands into the XSLT stylesheets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: XSLT injection vulnerability due to insecure processing of remote XSLT stylesheets. The XSLT parser is not running in secure mode, which allows for the execution of malicious code embedded within stylesheets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution on the remote server.
- **Attack vectors**: By providing a malicious remote XSLT through the `stylesheet` attribute of the `esi:include` tag.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to influence the `stylesheet` attribute of the `esi:include` tag to point to a malicious XSLT file hosted remotely.
