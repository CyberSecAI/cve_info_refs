  "CVE-2018-1000863": {
    "description": "The fix for [SECURITY-499](../2017-11-08) introduced a mechanism that renamed user directories on disk as a user with an unsafe user name (user ID) is loaded. Insufficient input validation allowed attackers to rename such user directories even for users with a safe user name by submitting a crafted user name when attempting to log in, even with an invalid password. Doing so prevented users from logging in successfully afterwards.\n\nJenkins no longer uses directory names as a reference for user names, making the on-load migration of user records unnecessary. Instead, the new file `users/users.xml` is used to map user names to the directories containing the user metadata.\n\nOn the first startup after updating Jenkins to a version containing this fix, existing legacy user directories are migrated.",
    "root_cause": "Insufficient input validation when renaming user directories during the user loading process allowed attackers to manipulate user directory names.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Improper handling of user directory names"
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can prevent legitimate users from logging in by forcing a migration of their user directories, effectively renaming the directories and making the user account inaccessible. This can be done remotely by an unauthenticated attacker.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted HTTP requests",
       "Submitting a crafted username during login attempts"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can trigger this vulnerability remotely without any prior authentication by sending a specially crafted username during a login attempt. The attacker does not need to know valid credentials.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability was found to be a result of the fix for SECURITY-499. The issue was addressed by no longer using directory names as a reference for user names and mapping user names to directories using `users/users.xml`."
