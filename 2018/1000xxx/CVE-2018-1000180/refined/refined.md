  "description": "The content provides information about CVE-2018-1000180, a flaw in the low-level interface to the RSA key pair generator in the Bouncy Castle cryptography library.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The low-level interface to the RSA key pair generator in Bouncy Castle could perform less Miller-Rabin primality tests than expected.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate primality testing during RSA key pair generation.",
      "DSA does not fully validate ASN.1 encoding during signature verification allowing for injection of unsigned data"
    ],
    "impact": "Under some circumstances, this could lead to the generation of weak RSA key pairs. Successful exploitation could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS). It is possible to inject extra elements in the sequence making up the signature and still have it validate, which in some cases may allow the introduction of 'invisible' data into a signed structure",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this flaw.",
      "Exploitable via special files that could be provided via the network while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the network",
      "It is possible to inject extra elements in the sequence making up the signature and still have it validate, which in some cases may allow the introduction of 'invisible' data into a signed structure."
