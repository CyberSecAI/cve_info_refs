Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2018-1000420:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Mesos Plugin provided a list of applicable credential IDs without proper permission checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization Check**: The plugin lacked a check to ensure only authorized users could access the list of credential IDs.
- **Information Disclosure**: This allowed any user with Overall/Read permissions to enumerate available credential IDs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential ID Enumeration**: Attackers could obtain a list of valid credential IDs that might be used in other attacks to capture the actual credentials. This on its own does not leak the credentials themselves.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network access to Jenkins:** An attacker would need network access to the Jenkins instance.
- **Overall/Read permission:** The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permissions within Jenkins to make the vulnerable request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a valid user account within the Jenkins system with at least "Overall/Read" permissions.
- The attacker needs to interact with the Jenkins web interface or API to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
- This vulnerability is related to the disclosure of credential IDs and does not directly expose the credentials themselves. However, the enumerated IDs can be leveraged in other attacks (e.g., the server-side request forgery vulnerability in Mesos Plugin - CVE-2018-1000421) to capture credentials.
- The fix for this vulnerability involved adding an "Overall/Administer" permission check to the enumeration functionality.

This information is more detailed than the basic CVE description, as it specifies the exact permission needed to exploit the vulnerability and how the enumeration of credential IDs can be used in a larger attack chain.
