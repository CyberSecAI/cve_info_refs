# Revoking token does not work for public clients #891

## Description

[![@ostinelli](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110142?v=4&size=48)](/ostinelli)[ostinelli](https://github.com/ostinelli)opened [on Oct 5, 2016](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper/issues/891#issue-181146063)

Hello,

I'm using grant `implicit` to allow authorizing an application from mobile applications, by initiating the flow as follows:

`https://example.com/oauth2/authorize?response_type=token&client_id={CLIENT_ID}&redirect_uri={REDIRECT_URI}&scope={REQUESTED_SCOPES}&state={STATE}`

After a successful oauth flow, the generated token is saved in the `oauth_access_tokens` table jointly with the application referenced by the original `client_id` value:

`#<Doorkeeper::AccessToken id: 396, resource_owner_id: 2, application_id: 1, token: "49d9a5c6232d6880e9b8df1c9369edf6bfc00aceedd5bb8164...", refresh_token: nil, expires_in: 1209600, revoked_at: nil, created_at: "2016-10-05 12:37:11", scopes: "profile">`

The `oauth_access_grants` table is empty, as expected since using `implicit`.

When I try to revoke this token using the [POST /oauth/revoke API endpoint](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper/wiki/API-endpoint-descriptions-and-examples#post-oauthrevoke) (the one at the bottom, which does not require `client_id` or `client_secret` to be passed), it does not get revoked.

Diving into the source code, I see in the `tokens_controller.rb`:

```
# OAuth 2.0 Section 2.1 defines two client types, "public" & "confidential".
# Public clients (as per RFC 7009) do not require authentication whereas
# confidential clients must be authenticated for their token revocation.
#
# Once a confidential client is authenticated, it must be authorized to
# revoke the provided access or refresh token. This ensures one client
# cannot revoke another's tokens.
#
# Doorkeeper determines the client type implicitly via the presence of the
# OAuth client associated with a given access or refresh token. Since public
# clients authenticate the resource owner via "password" or "implicit" grant
# types, they set the application_id as null (since the claim cannot be
# verified).
#
# https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.1
# https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7009

```

However, as per above the token *does* specify the `application_id`, despite having used the `implicit` grant type.

Hence, when I try to revoke this token I land in the controller's [`authorized?` method](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper/blob/v4.2.0/app/controllers/doorkeeper/tokens_controller.rb#L52):

```
def authorized?
  if token.present?
    # Client is confidential, therefore client authentication & authorization
    # is required
    if token.application_id?
      # We authorize client by checking token's application
      server.client && server.client.application == token.application
    else
      # Client is public, authentication unnecessary
      true
    end
  end
end
```

Where `token` is present and specifies an `application_id`, however `server.client` is `nil` hence `authorized?` returns false and the token does not get revoked.

I'm using doorkeeper `4.2.0`.

Is this expected behavior or am I missing something?

Thank you.

OAuth applications that obtain an access token using the "implicit" grant flow will have their ID set on the token record. Unfortunately this causes the revocation controller code to think it's as confidential application. Because of this, Doorkeeper enforces oauth client authentication and the revocation call fails.

Fixes [#891](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper/issues/891)

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Since this is security related, is it worth backporting to 4.x? Would require [#1031](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper/pull/1031) to also be backported. |

| [@nbulaj](https://github.com/nbulaj) this can be merged for 5.x fix.  Semver is getting in the way here, because I agree that we cannot "backport" to 4.x without requiring an upgrade path. [#1031](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper/pull/1031) defaults all apps as confidential, so it maintains backwards compatibility in that sense. However developers must:   1. Run a migration to add the column. 2. Decide for themselves which apps are public and update them accordingly   I'm not familiar with the rules around stuff like this, but can't we autogenerate some "hey you're using 4.2.0-secfix1, please run `rails generate doorkeeper:install_client_confidentiality`" which would simply add the column? That's essentially a MINOR-level sort of change. Then they opt into using it by toggling which apps are public?  🤷‍♂️ |

* add confidential column to oauth_applications

WARNING: This is a security release that addresses token revocation not working for public apps (CVE-2018-1000211)

There is no breaking change in this release, however to take advantage of the security fix you must:

  1. Run `rails generate doorkeeper:add_client_confidentiality` for the migration
  2. Review your OAuth apps and determine which ones exclusively use public grant flows (eg implicit)
  3. Update their `confidential` column to `false` for those public apps

This is a backported security release.

  For more information:

    * https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper/pull/1119
    * https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper/issues/891

* add note on what this migration default value means
