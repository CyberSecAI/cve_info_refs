Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-1000211:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect access control implementation within the Doorkeeper gem's token revocation API. Specifically, the `authorized?` method in `tokens_controller.rb` incorrectly identifies public OAuth clients, which are authorized using implicit or password grant types, as confidential clients, which require authentication, when they shouldn't.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect Access Control:** The core issue is that the `authorized?` method checks for `token.application_id?` to determine if a client is confidential. However, tokens generated via implicit grant flow also have application IDs, causing the method to incorrectly treat them as confidential clients.
*   **Missing Client Authentication:** Public clients, by definition, do not require authentication for token revocation. The code incorrectly enforces authentication for these clients.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unrevoked Access Tokens:**  The primary impact is that access tokens generated for public OAuth apps are not revoked via the API, even when a revocation request is made. These tokens remain valid until they expire, potentially leading to unauthorized access and data leaks.
*   **Access until expiry**: The tokens will remain valid until their set expiry.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by making network requests to the token revocation API.
*   **Public OAuth Application:** The attacker would need to have an access token obtained through a public OAuth application (using implicit or password grant).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access Token:** The attacker must possess a valid access token obtained from a vulnerable public OAuth application.
*   **Network Access:**  The attacker must have network access to send HTTP requests to the affected server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker doesn't need any confidential credentials or client secrets to exploit the vulnerability. They exploit it by attempting a revocation which does not work.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was present in Doorkeeper versions 4.2.0 and later but fixed in version 4.4.0.
*   The fix involves using `Application#confidential?` to correctly determine if a client is public or confidential during token revocation.
*   A migration was added to add a 'confidential' column to the 'oauth_applications' table, allowing developers to flag apps as public.
*   The vulnerability is considered high severity due to the potential for unauthorized access.
*   The fix was backported to the 4.x version line, with a migration required to add the 'confidential' column to the oauth_applications table.
*   The fix required a migration to add a `confidential` column to the oauth_applications table. Application owners then have to set the `confidential` to `false` for apps using the implicit grant type.
