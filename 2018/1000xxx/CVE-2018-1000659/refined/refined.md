The provided content is related to CVE-2018-1000659.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `pclzip.lib.php` file within the LimeSurvey application. Specifically, the `privExtractFile` function does not properly sanitize filenames extracted from zip archives, allowing for path traversal.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path traversal vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of filenames extracted from zip files.
- Code injection vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution (RCE) through the ability to overwrite or create arbitrary files on the server with the privileges of the webserver user.

**Attack vectors:**
- Uploading a specially crafted zip archive containing malicious filenames.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An authenticated user is required to upload the crafted zip file

**Technical Details:**
The commit message "fixed issue #13959: RCE via resource file upload as authenticated user" and the added line `$p_entry['filename'] = get_absolute_path($p_entry['filename']);` in `pclzip.lib.php` confirm the vulnerability and the patch. The patch uses `get_absolute_path()` to sanitize the file path, preventing path traversal.
