Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2018-1000156:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in how the `patch` utility handles ed-style patches. When `patch` encounters an ed-style patch, it invokes the `ed` editor to apply the changes. However, `patch` was not properly sanitizing input, and it would pass user-supplied ed commands directly to the `ed` program, potentially allowing for arbitrary command execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Unsanitized Input:** `patch` failed to properly sanitize the ed commands within the patch file. Specifically, it didn't prevent the use of the `!` (shell escape) command within the `ed` script.
2.  **Direct Execution of `ed` commands:** `patch` was invoking `ed` in a way that allowed unsanitized user-controlled ed commands to be executed, leading to potential shell escapes.
3. **Different behavior with piped and duped ed scripts:** When an ed script is provided through a pipe, `ed` behaves differently than when the same script is duped. Specifically, if the ed script has invalid commands, when passed via pipe, ed will attempt to process the following lines as new commands. This behavior allowed exploitation through specifically crafted ed scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A malicious actor could craft a patch file containing malicious ed commands which would then be executed with the privileges of the user running the `patch` command. This could lead to a full system compromise if the user was root.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If a regular user could trick a privileged user or process into applying the malicious patch file, the attacker could gain elevated privileges.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could potentially modify files or extract data based on the commands executed via the `ed` process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Patch Files:** The primary attack vector is through specially crafted patch files that contain malicious `ed` commands.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers can trick users into applying the malicious patch files through social engineering techniques.
*   **Compromised Software Supply Chain:** An attacker could inject malicious patches in a software supply chain, compromising a user's system when applying these patches.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create/modify patch files:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify patch files to inject malicious `ed` commands.
*   **Ability to deliver the patch file to target:** The attacker needs to have some means to deliver the malicious patch file to a target user or system.

**Additional Notes based on the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by writing the `ed` script to a temporary file before invoking `ed` to cause `ed` to abort on invalid commands. In the vulnerable code, the ed script was passed through a pipe, where invalid commands would be silently ignored, causing `ed` to continue processing the file. The use of a temporary file prevented this behavior.
*  Multiple fixes were pushed to the git repo. The initial patch addressed command execution through pipe injection. This was quickly followed up by a second fix that prevented shell command injection through file names and by adding an assertion that blocked filenames that start with the '!' character.
* There was a discussion on disabling automatic detection of ed-style patches.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple systems, including Debian, Ubuntu, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
* Red Hat's fix was backported to multiple older versions of their OS.
* A related vulnerability was discovered in the beep program, but this is unrelated to this CVE.
* A vulnerability was discovered on `ed`'s processing of filenames prepended with `!` character, which could lead to arbitrary command execution, and was exploitable via `patch` as well.
