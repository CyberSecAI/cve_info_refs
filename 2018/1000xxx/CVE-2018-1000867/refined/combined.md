Advisory: WeBid - Directory Traversal (Arbitrary Image File Read),
Blind SQL Injection and Reflected Cross Site Scripting
Release Date: 2018-12-03
Author: Nils Stünkel
CVE: CVE-2018-1000867, CVE-2018-1000868, CVE-2018-1000882
Application: WeBid, up to version 1.2.2
Risk: Medium
Vendor Status: Fix committed
Overview:
From webidsupport.com:
"WeBid provides open source auction software which has been used around
the world and has been downloaded over 100,000 times. It will allow you to
quickly set up your own auction site and get started straight away."
Multiple vulnerabilities were identified in version 1.2.2 of the WeBid auction
system.
A Directory Traversal vulnerability allows an unauthenticated, remote
attacker to read any PNG, JPEG or BMP image files that are accessible to
the server. In certain PHP configurations, this could also be used to issue
arbitrary requests against a other systems over HTTP, HTTPS, FTP or other
protocols, enabling unintended network boundary traversal.
Blind SQL injections were found in five scripts related to the "Your Auctions"
functionality. An authenticated attacker could use these vulnerabilities to
read data from the database, like password hashes or other secrets.
Two Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were also found, one of them
in the user login page.
Fixes for all three vulnerabilities have been committed to the Github
Repository on Nov 22nd, 2018 [7].
Details:
1) Directory Traversal (Arbitrary Image File Read)
In WeBid, the getthumb.php script handles the creation, caching and
delivery of image thumbnails as they are requested by a client. However,
no sanitization or boundary checking takes place on the 'fromfile' parameter
value. An attacker can pass directory traversal tokens like '../' and have
the application read and return arbitrary image files from the local file
system. The vulnerability was reported to the project via their Mantis,
the issue no. is 646[1].
$fromfile = (isset($\_GET['fromfile'])) ? $\_GET['fromfile'] : '';
$img = @getimagesize($fromfile);
/\* some more image format detection, setting $image\_type and $output\_type
appropriately \*/
load\_image($fromfile, $img['mime'], $image\_type, $output\_type);
/\* load\_image passes $fromfile to the corresponding imagecreatefrom\*
function and returns the resulting image to the client \*/
If allow\_url\_include[2] is enabled in PHP, the attacker could use PHP
protocol wrappers[3] to initiate outgoing connections from the web server,
e.g. towards a protected network, and possibly exfiltrate data. There
is currently no recommendation in the official WeBid documentation[4]
to disable allow\_url\_include.
When file types are requested that are not images, the vulnerability still
allows the attacker to determine the presence of files on the system,
as the error messages differ when the target file cannot be parsed
("Incorrect file type"), vs. when it doesn't exist ("Image not found").
2) Multiple Authenticated Blind SQL Injection Vulnerabilities
A number of scripts are passing unsanitized parameter values to the database,
and can therefore be leveraged for blind SQL injection. A user has to be
logged in for these vulnerabilities to be exploitable. This vulnerability
was reported as issue no. 647[5].
The following scripts and parameters are exploitable:
Script | Parameter
----------------------+------------
yourauctions.php | oa\_ord
yourauctions\_c.php | ca\_ord
yourauctions\_p.php | pa\_ord
yourauctions\_s.php | sa\_ord
yourauctions\_sold.php | solda\_ord
// One possible code path copies the GET parameters into the session:
$\_SESSION['oa\_ord'] = $\_GET['oa\_ord'];
$\_SESSION['oa\_type'] = $\_GET['oa\_type'];
// then the query is constructed
$query = "SELECT \* FROM " . $DBPrefix . "auctions
WHERE user = :user\_id AND closed = 0
AND starts <= CURRENT\_TIMESTAMP AND suspended = 0
ORDER BY " . $\_SESSION['oa\_ord'] . " " . $\_SESSION['oa\_type'] . " LIMIT
:offset, :perpage";
// and executed
$db->query($query, $params);
3) Multiple Cross Site Scripting Vulnerabilities
The scripts 'user\_login.php' and 'register.php' were found to be vulnerable
for Script Injection Attacks. When their respective action fails, their
form fields are echoed back to client without any sanitization, allowing
arbitrary JavaScript or Markup to be injected in the process. This
vulnerability was reported as issue no. 648[6].
From user\_login.php:
$template->assign\_vars(array(
'ERROR' => (isset($ERR)) ? $ERR : '',
'USER' => (isset($\_POST['username'])) ? $\_POST['username'] : ''
));

The links to find the thumbnails and images in the uploaded folder are no longer linked correctly after UPLOAD\_FOLDER was removed. I assume there will be more updates coming when some time is found to update it. I am not sure but, I am wondering if that code mod for the thumbnails and images could of been done in the common.php file in the defined UPLOAD\_FOLDER code.

The thumbnails do show on the sell.php page when you upload an image to auction off an item before the final submit. The images also show on the upldgallery.php page. After the final submit, the images don't show anywhere.

Sorry, something went wrong.
