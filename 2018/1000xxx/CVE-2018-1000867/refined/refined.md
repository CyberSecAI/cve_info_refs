Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the relevant details for CVE-2018-1000867:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The `getthumb.php` script in WeBid does not sanitize the `fromfile` parameter. This allows an attacker to use directory traversal sequences (like `../`) to access and read arbitrary image files on the server's filesystem.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The `fromfile` parameter in `getthumb.php` is not validated or sanitized, which leads to the directory traversal vulnerability.
*   **Lack of Path Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize the provided file paths before accessing them, enabling directory traversal.
*   **Unsafe use of file system functions:** The `getthumb.php` script uses functions that can be exploited if file paths are not validated, like `getimagesize()` and `imagecreatefrom*`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** An unauthenticated attacker can read any PNG, JPEG, or BMP image files that the web server process has access to.
*   **Potential Network Boundary Traversal:** If `allow_url_include` is enabled in PHP, the attacker could potentially make requests to other systems via protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Even if non-image files are requested, attackers can still determine the existence of files through different error messages.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `fromfile` parameter in a GET request to `getthumb.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:**  The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without needing to authenticate to the application.
*   **Knowledge of target file paths:** The attacker needs to know or guess the path of the file they want to access

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content contains information about fixes for this CVE, as well as details on two other vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-1000868 and CVE-2018-1000882) that were discovered alongside this one.
*   The commit logs and code changes show that the `fromfile` parameter is now sanitized using `basename()`, and the image retrieval now requires a valid numeric `auction_id`
*   The `getthumb.php` script now checks whether the provided path is a valid file
