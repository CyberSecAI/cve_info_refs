{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application allows self-registered users to create expressions that are interpreted by the JexlEngine without adequate restriction from the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate restriction on JexlEngine execution",
      "Unrestricted expression evaluation leading to code execution."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can compromise the server's host via a crafted JEXL script.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "A self-registered user creates a malicious expression using the computed attributes feature.",
        "The malicious expression is processed by JexlEngine, leading to remote code execution on the server."
      ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to self-register as a user.",
      "Ability to create or modify computed attributes with malicious JEXL expressions."
