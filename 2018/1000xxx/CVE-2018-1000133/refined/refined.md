Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability appears to be an incorrect implementation of permission checks within the `FromString` method and its usage in `CheckPermsT`, `StructDetailsA`, and `StructMenuA` functions. Specifically, the `FromString` function is defined as `func (perm Perm) FromString(str string) (err error)` and later being called as `err = perms.FromString(permstr)`. However, the code attempts to invoke it as if it was defined as `func FromString(str string) (perm Perm,err error)`, e.g., `perms,err = FromString(permstr)`. This mismatch indicates a misunderstanding or error in how the `FromString` function was being used.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Incorrect Function Signature:** The core weakness is the discrepancy between how `FromString` is defined (as a method on `Perm`) and how it's invoked (as a standalone function). This leads to the return values of `FromString` ( `perm Perm` ) not being correctly assigned in the calling functions.
- **Inconsistent Permission Checks:** As a result of the incorrect function invocation, permission checks in `CheckPermsT`, `StructDetailsA`, and `StructMenuA` may not be performed as intended. The `perms` variable is not populated, leading to inconsistent or bypassed permission checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Bypassed Permission Checks:** Due to the incorrect `FromString` call, the permission checks could be bypassed. This could allow unauthorized users to access functionalities they should not have access to.
- **Potential Data Exposure or Manipulation:** If the permission checks are meant to prevent access to sensitive data or operations, this vulnerability could lead to data exposure or unauthorized modifications.
- **Unintended Behavior:** Since the code uses the `perm` values to control the behavior, incorrect permission checks may lead to unexpected program states.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct Access:** An attacker may directly access functions/features that are protected by permission checks.
- **Manipulation of Input Data:** By manipulating the `permstr` argument to bypass the intended permission checks.
- **Indirect Access:** An attacker could indirectly gain access to protected data or functionality by leveraging vulnerable parts of the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to the Application:** The attacker needs to have access to the application.
- **Understanding of the Permission Logic:**  To fully exploit the vulnerability, the attacker would ideally need to understand how the application uses permissions, specifically how `permstr` values are set and how permission checks are performed.
