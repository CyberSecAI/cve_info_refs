Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2018-1000412:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Jira plugin did not perform permission checks on a form validation method and did not require POST requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing permission check on form validation method.
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability due to missing POST request requirement.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins could connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.
- This could lead to unauthorized access to the Jira system and potentially other systems using the compromised credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious user could exploit the CSRF vulnerability to trigger the form validation method.
- An attacker could use a crafted URL to connect to a malicious server and capture credentials.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
- The attacker needs to know the credential IDs to use in the attack, these can be discovered through another method.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is addressed by requiring POST requests for the form validation method and enforcing Overall/Administer or Item/Configure permissions.
- The affected versions are Jira Plugin up to and including 3.0.1. The fix is available in version 3.0.2.
