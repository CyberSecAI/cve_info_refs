Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000849:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how `apk`, the Alpine package manager, handles package extraction and cleanup. It extracts package contents (which are gzipped tar files) into the root filesystem `/` with `.apk-new` suffixes *before* verifying the package's hash against the signed manifest. If the hash verification fails, `apk` attempts to remove the extracted files. However, the vulnerability arises from the ability to create specific file system entries that exploit the file renaming process during package extraction.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1. **Arbitrary File Creation:** The package extraction process doesn't properly sanitize file paths, allowing an attacker to create directories and symlinks with specific names. This enables writing to arbitrary locations on the filesystem via symlink traversal.
2. **Insecure Cleanup:** The cleanup process fails to remove a directory after a file has been written within it via a symlink. Specifically, if a symlink is created to `/etc/apk/commit_hooks.d/x`, and a file is then written through the symlink, the directory `/etc/apk/commit_hooks.d` is left with contents, causing cleanup to fail.
3. **Commit Hooks:** `apk` has a feature where scripts in `/etc/apk/commit_hooks.d/` are executed before exiting, providing a vector for RCE by placing an executable in this location.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the target system. This is possible due to the creation of an executable file at `/etc/apk/commit_hooks.d/x`, which `apk` will execute before exiting. Additionally, the attacker is able to manipulate the return code of the vulnerable `apk` process by directly overwriting the process's memory using `/proc/<pid>/mem` to avoid failed build processes.

**Attack vectors:**
1. **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** An attacker can intercept network traffic and serve a malicious `.apk` file in place of a legitimate one. This works as the default repositories are not served over TLS.
2. **Compromised Package Mirror:** An attacker who controls a package mirror can distribute malicious `.apk` files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
1. **Network Access (for MITM):** The attacker needs to be able to intercept or manipulate network traffic between the client and the package repository.
2. **Malicious Package Creation:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious `.apk` package containing specifically crafted file paths and symlinks.
3. **Root access:** The attacker needs root access to write to `/proc/<pid>/mem` to manipulate the exit code.

**Additional Notes:**
The provided content includes a detailed explanation of how the exploit works:
*   It highlights the file creation and renaming during the extraction of `.apk` files.
*   It shows how a directory and symlink can be created to bypass the cleanup procedure.
*   It describes how the attacker uses the commit hooks functionality to achieve code execution.
*   It illustrates how writing shellcode into the `/proc/<pid>/mem` of the apk process leads to the successful exit of the process, which is useful for successful docker image builds using `apk`.
*   The blog post also contains the attacker's `python` code, which performs the memory manipulation.
*   The fix was applied by sanitizing the directory entries of the archive.
