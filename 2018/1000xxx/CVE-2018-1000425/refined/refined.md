Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-1000425:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The SonarQube Scanner Plugin stored the server authentication token in plain text within the global configuration file on the Jenkins controller.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Sensitive data (server authentication token) was stored unencrypted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Users with access to the Jenkins controller file system could view the unencrypted server authentication token.
- This could potentially allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the SonarQube server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access to the Jenkins controller file system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the Jenkins controller's file system. This typically requires shell access to the server where Jenkins is running.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involved encrypting the server authentication token in the configuration file on disk.
- The advisory explicitly mentions that the token is no longer transmitted in plain text to users viewing the configuration form.
- The advisory indicates that the vulnerability affected versions of the plugin up to and including 2.8, and the fix is available in version 2.8.1.
