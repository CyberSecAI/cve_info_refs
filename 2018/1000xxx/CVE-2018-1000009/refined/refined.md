Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000009:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Checkstyle plugin, along with other static analysis plugins, was vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) processing. This is due to the plugins using the `Static Analysis Utilities` plugin without proper handling of external entities when parsing XML files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XXE Injection:** The core vulnerability is an XXE injection flaw. The plugins parse XML files and are configured to resolve external entities, which allows an attacker to inject malicious external references in the XML data, which will be resolved by the server

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could leverage the XXE vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the Jenkins controller, potentially including secrets and configuration files.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The ability to resolve external entities could be used to perform SSRF attacks, where an attacker could make requests to internal or external resources from the Jenkins server.
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** An attacker could use external entities to cause the server to allocate excessive resources, potentially leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker configures a Jenkins build process to use one of the vulnerable plugins with a malicious XML file.
*   The plugin parses this malicious XML file, triggering the XXE vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to configure build processes within Jenkins, or influence the input XML in a manner accessible by the Jenkins build system.
*   The attacker requires at least the privilege level that allows to create build jobs, as they need to be able to configure the build to use the plugin and point it to the malicious XML file.

**Additional Information:**

*   The advisory specifically mentions that external entity resolution has been disabled in the patched versions of the plugins.
*   The affected plugins are all based on the `Static Analysis Utilities` plugin, indicating a common vulnerability point in that library.
*   This vulnerability is associated with the security advisory ID `SECURITY-656`
