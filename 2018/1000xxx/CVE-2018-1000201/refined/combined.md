Don't treat Symbol args different to Strings in ffi\_lib

```
Symbols were sent directly to FFI::DynamicLibrary.open in the first
attempt, resulting in a TypeError, so that only the mangled library
name was actually loaded.

This moves conversion to String to the front, so that subsequent
calls can assume Strings only.
```

Don't search in hardcoded paths on Windows

```
Native Windows apps don't use "/usr" path to store system dlls.
It's even more harm than good to search through these directories,
since they are used in Cygwin and it can lead to accidentaly loading
Cygwin DLLs into native Windows apps.

Hardcoded paths are disabled for MINGW and MSWIN environments only.
They are still present on Cygwin and MSYS2, because these POSIX-API
based environments don't use LoadLibrary() but dl_open() to load DLLs.
```
