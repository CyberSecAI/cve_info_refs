- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The "Destination" parameter in the box creation form is not sanitized before being reflected on the home page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious administrator can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other administrators or users who visit the home page. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An administrator creates a box with a malicious JavaScript payload in the "Destination" field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrator privileges to create boxes.
