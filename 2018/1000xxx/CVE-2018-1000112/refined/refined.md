Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000112:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Mercurial plugin's post-commit hook notification handler at the `/mercurial/` path was incorrectly extending a class that handled search requests at the `.../search/` path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allowed unauthorized users to submit search queries to Jenkins through the `/mercurial/` endpoint, gaining access to information (user names, node names) normally available only to users with Overall/Read permission.
- **Missing Access Control:** The post-commit hook handler lacked proper access control, enabling unauthenticated users to trigger the search functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could obtain a list of user names (both Jenkins users and SCM committers) and node names (built-in and agent nodes) by sending specially crafted requests to the `/mercurial/` URL. This information could be used to aid further attacks on the Jenkins instance.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers could send unauthenticated HTTP requests to the `/mercurial/` endpoint of the Jenkins server.
- **No User Interaction:** The attack does not require any user interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker only needs network access to the Jenkins instance.
- No specific user credentials or privileges are required for exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in Mercurial Plugin versions 2.2 and earlier.
- The fix was implemented by ensuring that the handler for `/mercurial/` requests no longer extends the search handler class.
- This issue is similar to vulnerabilities found in the Git and Subversion plugins.
