Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-1000187:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Kubernetes plugin for Jenkins was printing sensitive build variables to the build logs and controller logs when using pipeline steps like `withDockerRegistry`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:**  Sensitive information (passwords, tokens, etc.) present in build variables were being exposed in logs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  An attacker with access to the logs could gain access to sensitive information, potentially compromising other systems or services. This could enable further attacks such as unauthorized access or data breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via pipeline steps such as `withDockerRegistry`.
- An attacker would need access to the build logs or the Jenkins controller logs to retrieve the exposed information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires at least 'Overall/Read' access to Jenkins and access to build or controller logs.

**Additional Notes:**
- The plugin now applies masking of sensitive build variables to prevent this type of information disclosure
- This vulnerability is specific to versions of the Kubernetes plugin up to and including 1.7.0. It has been fixed in version 1.7.1.
