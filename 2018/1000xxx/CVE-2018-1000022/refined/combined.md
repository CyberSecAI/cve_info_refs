## Latest release: Electrum-4.5.8

[Release notes](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTES) -
[Previous releases](https://download.electrum.org)

Our executables are reproducible, and are signed independently by several builders.

The current executables have been signed by [ThomasV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spesmilo/electrum/master/pubkeys/ThomasV.asc), [SomberNight](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spesmilo/electrum/master/pubkeys/sombernight_releasekey.asc), [Emzy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spesmilo/electrum/master/pubkeys/Emzy.asc).

### How to verify GPG signatures

GPG signatures are a proof that distributed files have been signed
by the owner of the signing key. For example, if this website was
compromised and the original Electrum files had been replaced,
signature verification would fail, because the attacker would not
be able to create valid signatures. (Note that an attacker would be
able to create valid hashes, this is why we do not publish hashes
of our binaries here, it does not bring any security).

In order to be able to verify GPG signatures, you need to import
the public key of the signer. Electrum binaries are signed with
ThomasV's [public
key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spesmilo/electrum/master/pubkeys/ThomasV.asc). On Linux, you can import that key using the following
command: `gpg --import ThomasV.asc`. When you import a
key, you should check its fingerprint using independent sources,
such
as [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjYCXOyDy7Y),
or use
the [Web of
Trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust).

### Notes for Windows users

Electrum binaries are often flagged by various anti-virus
software. There is nothing we can do about it, so please stop
reporting that to us. Anti-virus software uses heuristics in order
to determine if a program is malware, and that often results in
false positives. If you trust the developers of the project, you
can verify the GPG signature of Electrum binaries, and safely
ignore any anti-virus warnings. If you do not trust the developers
of the project, you should build the binaries yourself, or run the
software from source. Finally, if you are really concerned about
malware, you should not use an operating system that relies on
anti-virus software.

Old versions of Windows might need to install the KB2999226 Windows update.

The JSONRPC interface is currently completely unprotected, I believe it should be a priority to add at least some form of password protection.

Scans for the JSONRPC interface of Ethereum wallets have already started:

Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank.

# Critical Electrum vulnerability

A vulnerability was [found](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/3374) in the Electrum wallet software which potentially allows random websites to steal your wallet via JavaScript. If you don't use Electrum, then you are not affected and you can ignore this.

Action steps:

1. If you are running Electrum, **shut it down right this second**.
2. Upgrade to [3.0.5](https://electrum.org/#download) (making sure to verify the PGP signature).

You don't necessarily need to *rush* to upgrade. In fact, in cases like this it can be prudent to wait a while just to make sure that everything is settled. The important thing is to not *use* the old versions. If you have an old version sitting somewhere not being used, then it is harmless as long as you do not forget to upgrade it before using it again later.

If at any point in the past you:

* Had Electrum open with no wallet passphrase set; and,
* Had a webpage open

Then it is *possible* that your wallet is already compromised. Particularly paranoid people might want to send all of the BTC in their old Electrum wallet to a newly-generated Electrum wallet. (Though probably if someone has your wallet, then they already would've stolen all of the BTC in it...)

This was just fixed hours ago. The Electrum developer will presumably post more detailed info and instructions in the near future.

**Update 1**: If you had no wallet password set, then theft is trivial. If you had a somewhat-decent wallet password set, then it seems that an attacker could "only" get address/transaction info from your wallet and change your Electrum settings, the latter of which seems to me to have a high chance of being exploitable further. So if you had a wallet password set, you can reduce your panic by a few notches, but you should still treat this very seriously.

**Update 2**: Version 3.0.5 was just released, which further protects the component of Electrum which was previously vulnerable. ~~It is not~~ ~~*critically*~~ ~~necessary to upgrade from 3.0.4 to 3.0.5, though upgrading would be a good idea.~~ Also, I've heard some people saying that only versions 3.0.0-3.0.3 are affected, but this is absolutely wrong; all versions from 2.6 to 3.0.3 are affected by the vulnerability.

**Update 3**: You definitely should upgrade from 3.0.4 to 3.0.5, since 3.0.4 may still be vulnerable to some attacks.

**Update 4**: [Here is the official, more complete response from the Electrum dev team.](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum-docs/blob/master/cve.rst)
