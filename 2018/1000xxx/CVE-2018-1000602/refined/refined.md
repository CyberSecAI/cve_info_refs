Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000602:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-1000602

**Vulnerability:** HTTP session fixation vulnerability in SAML Plugin

**Root Cause:** The SAML Plugin did not invalidate the previous session and create a new one upon successful login.

**Weakness:** Failure to invalidate the previous session after successful login, allowing reuse of session IDs.

**Impact:** An attacker who can control or obtain another user's pre-login session ID can impersonate that user. This allows unauthorized access and potentially malicious actions under the guise of the victim user.

**Attack Vector:**

1.  An attacker gains access to a user's pre-login session ID (e.g., through network eavesdropping, malware, or other means).
2.  The attacker uses the victim user's session ID to access the Jenkins instance, effectively impersonating them.
3. The victim logs into the Jenkins instance via SAML, which does not invalidate the old session.
4. The attacker is able to access the instance with the same session ID.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to obtain a legitimate user's session ID prior to their login.
*   The attacker needs to have the knowledge that the specific plugin is vulnerable.
*   No specific position is required other than having the ability to access the Jenkins instance.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in SAML Plugin versions 1.0.6 and earlier.
*   The fix involves invalidating the previous session and creating a new session during login in version 1.0.7.
*   The provided content also includes information about other vulnerabilities in different Jenkins plugins, but only the SAML Plugin vulnerability is relevant to this specific CVE.
