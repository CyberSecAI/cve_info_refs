      "root_cause": "The `shutil` module in Python versions prior to 2.7.16 and 3.x prior to 3.4.5 contains an improper neutralization of special elements used in a command ('Command Injection') vulnerability. Specifically the `make_archive` function in the `shutil` module of CPython uses the `distutils.spawn` which was found to not be good at quoting command lines and can result in injection of arbitrary files on the system or entire drive.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Passage of unfiltered user input to the affected function.",
        "Network"
      ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by passing unfiltered user input to the function, which results in the execution of external commands by the `shutil` module of CPython. The attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction."
