Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-1000060:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Sensu's redaction function failing to handle sensitive data within deeply nested data structures. Specifically, when multiple RabbitMQ connections are configured, the password is not properly redacted and is written in plain text within Sensu client logs. This occurs because the password redaction logic does not recursively check nested data structures for sensitive keywords.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of nested data structures during log redaction.
- Failure to recursively search for and redact sensitive information (specifically passwords).
- Logging sensitive data (passwords) in plain text.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exposure of sensitive information (RabbitMQ passwords) in log files.
- Potential compromise of the RabbitMQ server and related systems if passwords are leaked.
- Risk of unauthorized access or lateral movement within the network for a malicious actor who gains access to the log files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Accessing the Sensu client log files on the affected system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Access to the filesystem where the Sensu client logs are stored. This could be achieved through various means including compromised accounts, physical access or another vulnerability on the system.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue affects Sensu versions as shipped with Red Hat OpenStack Platform versions 7 through 12. Versions 7 through 9 were released as a technical preview without support and will not be fixed.
- The vulnerability was addressed in Sensu core v1.2.1.
- A fix was implemented to make the `redact_sensitive` function more versatile by enabling it to handle any object type as input and to recurse through nested objects like Hashes or Arrays for password redaction.
- Red Hat released security advisories (RHSA-2018:0616, RHSA-2018:1112, RHSA-2018:1606) to address this issue in Red Hat OpenStack Platform 12.0, 11.0, and 10.0 respectively.
