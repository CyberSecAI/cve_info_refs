Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000609:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Configuration as Code Plugin lacked a permission check in the method that handles the URL for exporting the system configuration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing authorization check: The plugin did not verify if the user accessing the configuration export URL had the necessary permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker with Overall/Read access to Jenkins could obtain a YAML export of the entire system configuration, which may contain sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: An attacker with Overall/Read access can access the vulnerable URL, triggering the export of the system configuration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is due to a missing permission check, allowing users with read access to export the entire Jenkins system configuration, potentially exposing sensitive data. The fix involves implementing the necessary permission checks to prevent unauthorized access to the configuration export functionality.
