- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `WavInFile::readHeaderBlock()` function in SoundStretch/WavFile.cpp uses a signed integer (`int`) to store the length of a data block read from a WAV file. If the length field in the WAV file is a large value, the `int` can become negative when it's read and potentially byte-swapped using `_swap32(nLen)`. This negative value is then used in calculations, leading to an integer underflow.  Specifically, the calculation of `nDump` becomes negative, causing the check intended to truncate `nLen` to fail, and `fread` is then called with this negative value, which will be converted to a very large unsigned number by `fread`.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer overflow. The vulnerability lies in the incorrect use of a signed integer (`int`) to store the length of a data block read from a WAV file leading to the `fread()` function being called with a large, attacker-controlled size, causing an overflow on the heap.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can overwrite large portions of heap memory with data from a crafted WAV file leading to arbitrary code execution.

- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a maliciously crafted WAV file to an application using the vulnerable `WavInFile::readHeaderBlock()` function.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious WAV file to the vulnerable application, and requires knowledge of the format of the WAV file, specifically, the ability to manipulate the `fmt` or `fact` chunk's length fields.
