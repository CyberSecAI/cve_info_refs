Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2018-1000424:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Artifactory Plugin, prior to version 2.16.2, stored credentials (specifically, Artifactory server passwords) directly in plain text in its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller's file system. This was due to the plugin not removing the old, insecurely stored credentials when switching to the Credentials Plugin for secure storage introduced in version 2.4.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Storage of Credentials:** The primary weakness is the storage of sensitive credentials in plain text, making them easily accessible to anyone with file system access to the Jenkins controller.
*   **Failure to Migrate Securely:** The plugin failed to remove older credentials, when migrating to the Credentials Plugin for storing credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Exposure:** Attackers with access to the Jenkins controller's file system could easily obtain the Artifactory server passwords. This would allow them to access the Artifactory instance, potentially gaining access to sensitive artifacts and build data and/or causing further malicious activity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File System Access:** The attack vector is direct access to the Jenkins controller's file system. This could be achieved through various means such as:
    *   Compromised accounts on the Jenkins controller server
    *   Exploitation of other vulnerabilities allowing file system access
    *   Malicious insiders with legitimate access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Jenkins Controller's File System:** Attackers need to have some form of access to the Jenkins server's underlying operating system and file system, with sufficient privileges to read the plugin's configuration files.
*   **Knowledge of Configuration File Location:**  Attackers must be aware of the specific location of the plugin's configuration files on the Jenkins controller file system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in Artifactory Plugin version 2.16.2. This version removes the obsolete plain text credentials when the Credentials Plugin integration is in use.
*   The severity is rated as "low" due to the requirement of having filesystem access, which is not as straightforward as other network-based vulnerabilities.

In summary, CVE-2018-1000424 is due to a failure in the Artifactory Plugin to securely store credentials, which could be easily exploited with file system access to the Jenkins controller.
