Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-1000153:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vSphere Plugin did not enforce permission checks on methods responsible for form validation. Additionally, the form validation methods did not require POST requests, leading to a CSRF vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing permission checks:**  Form validation methods lacked proper permission checks. This allowed users with `Overall/Read` access to perform actions intended only for privileged users.
*   **CSRF vulnerability:** Form validation methods were vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) because they did not require POST requests.
*   **Credential capturing:** By exploiting the lack of permission checks, an attacker could connect to a vSphere server using attacker-specified credential IDs, which could be obtained through other means, effectively capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.
*   **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability allowed users to connect to configured vSphere servers and look up information, which could lead to a denial of service by overloading resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential disclosure:** Attackers could capture vSphere credentials stored in Jenkins, leading to unauthorized access to vSphere environments.
*   **Denial of Service:** Attackers could potentially cause a denial of service by overloading the vSphere server through excessive information lookups.
*   **Unauthorized actions:** Users with only Overall/Read access could perform actions that they should not have been able to perform.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** An attacker with network access to the Jenkins instance could exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Web browser:** An attacker could trick a user with Overall/Read access into making a malicious request (CSRF).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Jenkins Access:** An attacker must have at least Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
*  **Knowledge of Credentials IDs:** The attacker needs to know the credential ID. This could be obtained through another vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
* This vulnerability is one of two vulnerabilities identified in the vSphere plugin in this security advisory, the other is CVE-2018-1000152. They were resolved together in version 2.17 of the plugin.
* This vulnerability is related to the  lack of CSRF protection and insufficient permission checks.
* The advisory provides a fix by implementing POST request requirements and enforcing appropriate user permissions for form validation methods.
