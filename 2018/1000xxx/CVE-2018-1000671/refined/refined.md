Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-1000671

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the "referer" parameter within the `wwsympa.fcgi` login action in Sympa.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Open Redirect:** The application redirects users to a URL specified in the "referer" parameter without proper validation. This allows an attacker to redirect a user to a malicious site.
*   **Potential XSS:**  The open redirect vulnerability can be exploited to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, particularly using data URIs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Redirection to malicious sites:** Attackers can redirect users to phishing sites or sites hosting malicious content.
*   **XSS attacks:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the redirected page, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes a malicious URL within the "referer" parameter. The user is tricked into clicking this malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the "referer" parameter pointing to an attacker-controlled site or a malicious data URI, and persuade the victim to click on this link. No specific position is required beyond this.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability exists in Sympa versions prior to the fix.
*   The issue was found to be reproducible in Sympa versions 6.2.16 and earlier, and was fixed in later versions.
*   The issue is described as a CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') vulnerability.
