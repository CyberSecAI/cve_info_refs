# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Package        : sympa
Version        : 6.2.16~dfsg-3+deb9u4
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-1000671 CVE-2020-26880
Debian Bug     : 908165 972189

A privilege escalation was discovered in Sympa, a modern mailing list
manager. It is fixed when Sympa is used in conjunction with common
MTAs (such as Exim or Postfix) by disabling a setuid executable,
although no fix is currently available for all environments (such as
sendmail).  Additionally, an open-redirect vulnerability was
discovered and fixed.

CVE-2020-26880

    Sympa allows a local privilege escalation from the sympa user
    account to full root access by modifying the sympa.conf
    configuration file (which is owned by sympa) and parsing it
    through the setuid sympa_newaliases-wrapper executable.

CVE-2018-1000671

    Sympa contains a CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open
    Redirect') vulnerability in The "referer" parameter of the
    wwsympa.fcgi login action. that can result in Open redirection and
    reflected XSS via data URIs.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
6.2.16~dfsg-3+deb9u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your sympa packages.

For the detailed security status of sympa please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/sympa>

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

CVE ID         : CVE-2018-1000671
Debian Bug     : 908165

An Open Redirect vulnerability has been discovered in sympa. The
"referer" parameter of the wwsympa.fcgi login action can result in
Open redirection and potential Cross Site Scripting via data URIs.

## Description

[![@hmpf](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11956096?v=4&size=48)](/hmpf)[hmpf](https://github.com/hmpf)opened [on Apr 16, 2018](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/issues/268#issue-314539726)

The following link redirects to bing:

<https://listes.renater.fr/sympa?referer=https://www.bing.com&passwd=&previous_action=&action=login&action_login=&previous_list=&list=&email=>

It also works in 6.2.16. We have no newer sympa to test with.

It seems to me maybe this is a bug in a perl dependency? I couldn't find "referer" directly in sympa's source code during a (very) cursory grep.
