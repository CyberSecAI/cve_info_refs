{
  "CVE-2018-1000119": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability is a timing attack in the CSRF token validation within the rack-protection gem. The vulnerability stems from the use of non-constant time string comparison which can allow an attacker to guess a valid CSRF token character by character. Versions prior to 1.5.5 and 2.0.0 are vulnerable.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the use of a non-constant time string comparison function in the CSRF token validation, which allows an attacker to potentially deduce valid tokens by observing the time it takes for comparisons to fail.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Timing Attack",
      "Insecure comparison of authentication tokens."
    ],
    "Impact": "A malicious user could potentially guess a valid CSRF token one character at a time by considering the time it takes for a signature validation to fail, leading to unauthorized actions.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network connectivity to the ruby application",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs network access to the application.",
    "Affected software/versions": "Versions of rack-protection gem prior to 1.5.5 and 2.0.0"
