## Description

[![@rosa](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813033?u=9d30b2e7dad100c407ded917712e84a71bf7581f&v=4&size=48)](/rosa)[rosa](https://github.com/rosa)opened [on Nov 9, 2018](https://github.com/basecamp/easymon/issues/26#issue-379140689)

When passing an invalid check name to `ChecksController#show`, an exception is raised, resulting in a 406 response with the following body:

```
"No check named '#{name}'"

```

Firefox renders that body, and if the name includes any JavaScript code via `<script>` tags, it'll be executed.

This fixes [#26](https://github.com/basecamp/easymon/issues/26), where the check name could be used to execute a reflected XSS attack.

Sorry, something went wrong.
