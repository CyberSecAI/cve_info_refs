Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000174:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Google Login Plugin, after successful authentication, redirected users to an arbitrary URL specified as a query parameter. The plugin did not validate or sanitize the provided URL, which led to the open redirect vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Open Redirect:** The primary vulnerability is an open redirect, where the application redirects the user to a URL controlled by the attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers could craft malicious URLs embedded in the login process. When a user clicks on this URL after logging in via the Google Login plugin, they would be redirected to the attacker's controlled website, potentially impersonating the legitimate site. This could lead to credential theft or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL Parameter:** The attack vector is the arbitrary URL passed as a query parameter. This URL is used by the Google Login Plugin to redirect users after a successful login.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not need any prior privileges on the Jenkins system.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker relies on the user being redirected to the malicious URL after successful login. The user is required to interact with a manipulated URL.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter:** The attacker must be aware that the URL is taken from a user supplied query parameter.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability was to restrict the redirects to relative URLs only.
*   The vulnerability is associated with the Jenkins Google Login plugin.
*   The vulnerability affects versions 1.3 and earlier of the Google Login Plugin.
