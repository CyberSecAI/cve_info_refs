```
  - Root cause of vulnerability: A null pointer dereference occurs in nghttp2 when processing an ALTSVC frame that is larger than the library can accept. The pointer to the ALTSVC frame payload is left NULL, and subsequent access to a field via this pointer results in a segmentation fault.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper input validation when handling ALTSVC frames leading to a null pointer dereference.
  - Impact of exploitation: A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by sending a specially crafted, oversized ALTSVC frame, causing the application to crash.
  - Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by sending a malicious ALTSVC frame over the network to a client or server.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be able to send a malicious ALTSVC frame to a vulnerable server or client. The client or server must have explicitly enabled reception of ALTSVC frames using `nghttp2_option_set_builtin_recv_extension_type(opt, NGHTTP2_ALTSVC)`.
