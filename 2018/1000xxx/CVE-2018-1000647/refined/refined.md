Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000647:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of the `unlink` function in PHP without proper sanitization of user-supplied input. Specifically, the application directly uses the value from `$_POST['docid']` as the file path to be deleted.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unrestricted File Deletion:** The primary vulnerability is the unrestricted deletion of files. Since the application doesn't validate or sanitize the path provided in `$_POST['docid']`, an authenticated user can manipulate this parameter to delete arbitrary files on the server, leading to a denial-of-service.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or validate user-supplied input, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can delete critical files, causing the application to malfunction or become unusable, leading to a denial of service.
- **Data Loss:** Arbitrary files can be deleted from the server, resulting in potential data loss.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a POST request with the `docid` parameter set to a file path that the attacker wants to delete.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be a valid authenticated user to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `lh-ehr/patient_portal/import_template.php` on line 30.
