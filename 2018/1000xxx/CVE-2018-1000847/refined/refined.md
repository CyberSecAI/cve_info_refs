The provided content relates to CVE-2018-1000847.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application was vulnerable to persistent XSS due to improper handling of user-provided data, specifically in usernames and potentially other fields.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Lack of proper sanitization of user inputs before rendering them in HTML.
- The vulnerability is present in the user admin panel, where user data is displayed, specifically when the admin opens the User List.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious script code into a user's username.
- When an administrator views the user list, the injected script code would execute within the administrator's session.
- This could lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, data theft, or other administrative actions being performed by the attacker.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through user-controlled input fields, such as the username.
- An attacker can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into these fields.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a user record with a malicious payload in a user-related field (username).
- The attacker does not need to be an admin.
- The exploit requires an administrator to access the user list or a page where the vulnerable user data is rendered.
