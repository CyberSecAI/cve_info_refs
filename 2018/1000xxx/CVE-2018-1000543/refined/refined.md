The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that leads to arbitrary code execution in the `akiee` application.

- **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-provided input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code. Specifically, the application allows the `onerror` attribute within the `<img>` tag to execute JavaScript code, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.

- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is the lack of input sanitization, leading to XSS.

- **Impact of Exploitation:**
    - Arbitrary Code Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. The provided example demonstrates the ability to get system information (OS platform, homedir).
    - Reverse Shell: The vulnerability could be exploited further to establish a reverse shell, granting the attacker full control over the victim's machine.

- **Attack Vectors:**
    -  The attacker inserts malicious code within a task's details using a crafted input string, specifically the `<img>` tag with `onerror` attribute.
   - The attacker can trick the user into opening a crafted `liveflow.md` file, which contains the malicious payload in the task details.
    
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - The attacker must be able to create a task or modify a task's details in the `akiee` application or create a specially crafted `liveflow.md` file to be opened by a user.
    - The user needs to open the crafted `liveflow.md` file, which will cause the execution of the malicious JavaScript code.
