Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000869:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection located in the `item-add-submit.php` file. The `object_type` parameter, which is used to construct a SQL query, was not properly sanitized or validated before being used in the `$Tools->fetch_object()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code via the `object_type` parameter. The application does not directly output the results of the query, thus the injection is considered blind. The attacker uses the error messages to verify injection.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `object_type` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database by using the blind SQL injection. Although the response does not display the data, it does display errors related to incorrect table names, thus the attacker can use this to perform SQL injection.
- **Potential Data Manipulation:** Depending on the database permissions, it might be possible for an attacker to modify or delete data through the SQL injection.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/app/admin/nat/item-add-submit.php` endpoint.
- **`object_type` parameter:** The `object_type` parameter within the POST data is the specific injection point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs a valid `PHPSESSID` cookie, which implies a valid user session on the application.
- **Understanding of the vulnerable parameter:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable `object_type` parameter in the  `item-add-submit.php` file.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) `curl` command demonstrating the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was fixed in commit `856b10ca85a24c04ed8651f4e13f867ec78a353d` by adding a check to validate the `object_type` parameter against an allowed list: `['subnets', 'ipaddresses']`.
- The changelog includes that the vulnerability is in `nat/item-add-submit.php` and is associated with the issue #2344.
