Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `stable.php` file of the `i-librarian` project.
*   The code directly prints the value of the `id` parameter from the URL's GET request into an `<a>` tag's `href` attribute without proper sanitization or encoding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The injected script is reflected back to the user's browser within the context of the application, allowing execution of the attacker's payload.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable parameter.
*   When a user clicks on a specially crafted link, the attacker's script executes within the user's browser.
*   This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Redirection to malicious sites.
    *   Stealing of sensitive user data.
    *   Defacement of the website.
    *   Other malicious actions within the context of the user's session and browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted URL.
*   An attacker would create a URL that includes malicious JavaScript within the `id` parameter.
*   When a victim visits the URL the script will be executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious URL with the payload included.
*   The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking on this crafted link. This could be done through social engineering, by sending the link through email, or posting it on social media, etc.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code snippet is:
```php
<a href="<?php print IL_URL; ?>?id=<?php print $_GET['id']; ?>" style="display:block">
```
*   `IL_URL` is a constant defined elsewhere
*   `$_GET['id']` is a user-controlled input from the URL
* The code prints this parameter directly into the href attribute of an <a> tag, making it susceptible to XSS.

**Proof of Concept (POC):**

The provided POC demonstrates the vulnerability:

`http://localhost/Librarian/stable.php?id="/> <script>confirm(document.domain)</script>`

This POC will insert the provided JavaScript code into the href and cause an alert box with the document domain.
