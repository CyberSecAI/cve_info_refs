- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The password reset functionality in CMS Made Simple uses the Host header from the password reset request to generate the password reset link sent to the user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Host header injection vulnerability, insecure password reset mechanism. The application trusts the Host header value, which can be controlled by the attacker, to construct the password reset URL.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can poison the password reset link by injecting a malicious host header. When the administrator clicks the poisoned link, the attacker can intercept the password reset token and use it to reset the administrator's password, gaining full control of the CMS.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the password reset form, where the attacker sends a POST request with a modified Host header.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to know the administrator's username and must be able to send a crafted POST request to the password reset endpoint. They also need a server to receive the reset link request.
