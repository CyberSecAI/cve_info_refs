Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2018-1000858:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of Web Key Directory (WKD) lookups by GnuPG's `dirmngr` component. Specifically, it arises from two main issues:

1.  **Insufficient Validation of DNS SRV Records:** `dirmngr` does not properly sanitize the target hostname received in a DNS SRV response, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary characters and potentially redirect the WKD lookup to any URL.
2.  **Lack of Restriction on HTTP Redirects:** `dirmngr`'s handling of HTTP redirects (301, 302, 307) allows for redirection to arbitrary URLs, even to those outside the intended domain, thus enabling attackers to trigger requests to any server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) / SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):** The vulnerabilities allow an attacker to craft malicious SRV records or manipulate HTTP redirects to cause the client to make requests to arbitrary URLs. This can be used to access internal network resources or perform unintended actions on vulnerable services behind firewalls.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Memory Exhaustion:** When downloading a keyring via WKD, the downloaded file is temporarily stored in memory without any size limits, which could lead to memory exhaustion and the termination of `gpg` or other processes.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Keyring Pollution:** A malicious WKD server can inject multiple keys into a user's keyring.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can make the client perform arbitrary HTTP GET requests, potentially accessing sensitive data or triggering unintended actions (CSRF/SSRF).
*   An attacker can cause the client to crash by consuming excessive memory (DoS).
*   An attacker can pollute the user's keyring with unnecessary keys, degrading performance and impacting usability (DoS).
*   An attacker can potentially discover the IP address of the user and their DNS server, which could be a privacy issue.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious DNS SRV Records:** An attacker can control a domain's DNS SRV record for `_openpgpkey._tcp.example.com`, pointing it to a malicious URL.
*   **Malicious HTTP Redirects:** An attacker can host a WKD server that redirects to an arbitrary URL using HTTP redirects (301, 302, 307).
*   **Malicious WKD Server:**  An attacker can host a WKD server that provides a large keyring to download or a large number of keys.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **DNS Control (for SRV record attack):** The attacker needs control over the DNS records for the targeted domain, specifically the ability to modify the SRV record for `_openpgpkey._tcp.example.com`.
*   **Web Server Control (for redirect attack):** The attacker needs control over a web server to host a WKD service that will redirect requests.
*   **Network Access (for SSRF):** In some cases, the attacker would need to be able to initiate the attack from a network that can reach the internal resources (e.g., behind a firewall).
*  **No user interaction required:** The WKD lookup can be triggered automatically by email clients like Thunderbird/Enigmail.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects GnuPG versions 2.1.18-2.2.9 (for SRV Record issue), 2.1.12-2.2.11 (for redirect issue) and 2.1.12-2.2.9 (for memory exhaustion issue).
*   The issue with SRV records and memory exhaustion was fixed in version 2.2.10. The redirect issue was fixed in 2.2.12.
*   The issue with keyring pollution was not fixed by version 2.2.12 and was seen as a design choice.
