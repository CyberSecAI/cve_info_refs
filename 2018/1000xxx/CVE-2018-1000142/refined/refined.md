Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000142:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2018-1000142

**Description:**
The GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin stored serialized objects in `build.xml` files that contained the credential used to poll Jenkins. This could be used by users with Jenkins controller file system access to obtain GitHub credentials.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin serialized objects containing GitHub credentials and stored them in `build.xml` files, unencrypted.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Storage of Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the storage of sensitive GitHub credentials (API tokens or username/password) in serialized objects within `build.xml` files on the Jenkins controller's file system. This storage is insecure as the credentials were not encrypted.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Credential Exposure:** An attacker with access to the Jenkins controller's file system could extract the stored GitHub credentials.
- **Unauthorized Access:** The exposed credentials could then be used to access the victim's GitHub repositories and potentially other services with those same credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
- **File System Access:** The primary attack vector is gaining unauthorized access to the Jenkins controller's file system. This could happen through various means, including:
    - Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Jenkins server itself.
    - Gaining access to the underlying server or virtual machine.
    - Social engineering or phishing attacks that lead to an attacker gaining access to the file system.
    - Insider threat

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **File System Access to Jenkins controller:** The attacker needs read access to the file system where Jenkins stores the `build.xml` files.
- **Basic understanding of the Jenkins directory structure:** While not strictly required, knowledge of where `build.xml` is stored would help an attacker locate the vulnerable files.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affected versions of the GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin up to and including 1.39.0.
- Version 1.40.0 and later no longer store serialized objects containing the credential on disk.
- The advisory also recommends revoking any old GitHub credentials used in Jenkins, and provides a script to attempt to remove stored credentials from `build.xml` files.

This analysis provides more detail than the original CVE description by including:
- Specific details of how the credentials were stored (serialized objects in build.xml).
- A more in-depth explanation of the attack vectors.
- Specific version details
- Remediation advice.
