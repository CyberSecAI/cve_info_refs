# GitHub Pull Request Builder

How to installThe Jenkins project announced unresolved security vulnerabilities affecting the current version of this plugin ([why?](https://www.jenkins.io/security/plugins/#unresolved)):

* **[Missing permission check allows enumerating credentials IDs](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2023-01-24/#SECURITY-2789%20(1))**
* **[CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2023-01-24/#SECURITY-2789%20(2))**

* [Documentation](/ghprb/)
* [Releases](/ghprb/releases/)
* [Issues](/ghprb/issues/)
* [Dependencies](/ghprb/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/ghprb/healthscore/)

You should probably migrate to [GitHub Branch Source
Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/GitHub%2BBranch%2BSource%2BPlugin)

This plugin builds pull requests in github and report results.

More **up to date** information is available on the:

[Github
README.md](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ghprb-plugin/blob/master/README.md)

**Commands:**

When a new pull request is opened in the project and the author of the
pull request isn't white-listed, builder will ask "Can one of the admins
verify this patch?".

* "ok to test" to accept this pull request for testing
* "test this please" for a one time test run
* "add to whitelist" to add the author to the whitelist

If the build fails for other various reasons you can rebuild.

* "retest this please" to start a new build

**Installation:**

* I recommend to create GitHub 'bot' user that will be used for
  communication with GitHub (however you can use your own account if
  you want).
* The user needs to have push rights for your repository (must be
  collaborator (user repo) or must have Push & Pull rights
  (organization repo)).
* If you want to use GitHub hooks have them set automatically the user
  needs to have administrator rights for your repository (must be
  owner (user repo) or must have Push, Pull & Administrative rights
  (organization repo))

* Install the plugin.
* Go to ``Manage Jenkins`` -> ``Configure System`` ->
  ``GitHub pull requests builder`` section.

* Add GitHub usernames of admins (these usernames will be used as
  defaults in new jobs).
* Under Advanced, you can modify:
  + The phrase for adding users to the whitelist via comment. (Java
    regexp)
  + The phrase for accepting a pull request for testing. (Java
    regexp)
  + The phrase for starting a new build. (Java regexp)
  + The crontab line. This specify default setting for new jobs.
* Under Application Setup
  + There are global and job default extensions that can be
    configured for things like:
    - Commit status updates
    - Build status messages
    - Adding lines from the build log to the build result message
    - etc.

#### Credentials

* If you are using Enterprise GitHub set the server api URL in
  ``GitHub server api URL``. Otherwise leave there
  ``[https://api.github.com](https://api.github.com/)``.
* A GitHub API token or username password can be used for access to
  the GitHub API
* To setup credentials for a given GitHub Server API URL:
  + Click Add next to the ``Credentials`` drop down
    - For a token select ``Kind`` -> ``Secret text``
      * If you haven't generated an access token you can
        generate one in ``Test Credentials...``.
        + Set your 'bot' user's GitHub username and password.
        + Press the ``Create Access Token`` button
        + Jenkins will create a token credential, and give you
          the id of the newly created credentials. The default
          description is: ``serverAPIUrl + " GitHub auto
          generated token credentials"``.
    - For username/password us ``Kind`` -> ``Username with
      password``
      * The scope determines what has access to the credentials
        you are about to create
    - The first part of the description is used to show different
      credentials in the drop down, so use something
      semi-descriptive
    - Click ``Add``
  + Credentials will automatically be created in the domain given by
    the ``GitHub Server API URL`` field.
  + Select the credentials you just created in the drop down.
  + The first fifty characters in the Description are used to
    differentiate credentials per job, so again use something
    semi-descriptive
* Add as many GitHub auth sections as you need, even duplicate server
  URLs

* Save to preserve your changes.

#### Creating job:

* Create a new job.
* Add the project's GitHub URL to the "GitHub project" field (the one
  you can enter into browser. eg: "<https://github.com/janinko/ghprb>")
* Select Git SCM.
* Add your GitHub "Repository URL".
* Under Advanced, set "refspec" to

  ```
  +refs/pull/*:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*

  ```
* In "Branch Specifier", enter

  ```
  ${sha1}

  ```

  or if you want to use the actual commit in the pull request, use

  ```
  ${ghprbActualCommit}

  ```
* Under "Build Triggers", check "Github pull requests builder".

  + Add admins for this specific job.
  + If you want to use GitHub hooks for automatic testing, read the
    help for "Use github hooks for build triggering" in job
    configuration. Then you can check the checkbox.
  + In Advanced, you can modify:
    - The crontab line for this specific job. This schedules
      polling to GitHub for new changes in Pull Requests.
    - The whitelisted users for this specific job.
    - The organisation names whose members are considered
      whitelisted for this specific job.
* Save to preserve your changes.

  Make sure you **DON'T** have "Prune remote branches before build"
  advanced option selected, since it will prune the branch created to
  test this build. As noted in issue
  [#507](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ghprb-plugin/issues/507) this
  may be achieved by unchecking 'Lightweight checkout'.

If you want to manually build the job, in the job setting check "This
build is parameterized" and add string parameter named "sha1". When
starting build give the "sha1" parameter commit id you want to build or
refname (eg: "origin/pr/9/head").

#### Environment Variables

The plugin makes some very useful environment variables available.

* ghprbActualCommit
* ghprbActualCommitAuthor
* ghprbActualCommitAuthorEmail
* ghprbPullDescription
* ghprbPullId
* ghprbPullLink
* ghprbPullTitle
* ghprbSourceBranch
* ghprbTargetBranch
* ghprbCommentBody
* sha1

#### Job DSL Support

The plugin contains an extension for the Job DSL plugin to add DSL
syntax for configuring the build trigger and the pull request merger
post-build action.

Here is an example showing all DSL syntax elements:

```
job('example') {
    scm {
        git {
            remote {
                github('test-owner/test-project')
                refspec('+refs/pull/*:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*')
            }
            branch('${sha1}')
        }
    }
    triggers {
        githubPullRequest {
            admin('user_1')
            admins(['user_2', 'user_3'])
            userWhitelist('you@you.com')
            userWhitelist(['me@me.com', 'they@they.com'])
            orgWhitelist('my_github_org')
            orgWhitelist(['your_github_org', 'another_org'])
            cron('H/5 * * * *')
            triggerPhrase('OK to test')
            onlyTriggerPhrase()
            useGitHubHooks()
            permitAll()
            autoCloseFailedPullRequests()
            allowMembersOfWhitelistedOrgsAsAdmin()
            extensions {
                commitStatus {
                    context('deploy to staging site')
                    triggeredStatus('starting deployment to staging site...')
                    startedStatus('deploying to staging site...')
                    statusUrl('http://mystatussite.com/prs')
                    completedStatus('SUCCESS', 'All is well')
                    completedStatus('FAILURE', 'Something went wrong. Investigate!')
                    completedStatus('PENDING', 'still in progress...')
                    completedStatus('ERROR', 'Something went really wrong. Investigate!')
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```

## Descriptions

### GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin stores GitHub access tokens in build.xml

**SECURITY-261
/
CVE-2018-1000142**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ghprb`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ghprb)**

**Description:**

GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin stored serialized objects in `build.xml` files that contained the credential used to poll Jenkins.
This can be used by users with Jenkins controller file system access to obtain GitHub credentials.

Since 1.40.0, the plugin no longer stores serialized objects containing the credential on disk.

Builds started before the plugin was updated to 1.40.0 will retain the encoded credentials on disk.
We strongly recommend revoking old GitHub credentials used in Jenkins.
We’re providing [a script for use in the Script Console that will attempt to remove old stored credentials from build.xml files](https://github.com/jenkinsci-cert/SECURITY-261).

### GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin stores webhook secret in plain text

**SECURITY-262
/
CVE-2018-1000143**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:**

**Description:**

GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin stored the webhook secret shared between Jenkins and GitHub in plain text.

This allowed users with Jenkins controller local file system access and Jenkins administrators to retrieve the stored password.
The latter could result in exposure of the passwords through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin 1.32.1 and newer stores the webhook secret encrypted on disk.

### Cucumber Living Documentation Plugin disabled Content-Security-Policy for archived and workspace files

**SECURITY-308
/
CVE-2018-1000144**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`cucumber-living-documentation`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/cucumber-living-documentation)**

**Description:**

Jenkins 1.641 and 1.625.3 introduced `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP headers as protection against Cross-Site Scripting attacks using workspace files and archived artifacts served using `DirectoryBrowserSupport` ([SECURITY-95](/security/advisory/2015-12-09/)).

Cucumber Living Documentation Plugin disabled this XSS protection until Jenkins was restarted whenever a Cucumber Report was viewed by any user to work around the `Content-Security-Policy` limitations.

While disabling this protection mechanism temporarily may be necessary to make plugins work that haven’t been adapted to work with the Content-Security-Policy restriction, this should only be done by administrators, as doing so may result in a security issue (see [Configuring Content Security Policy](/doc/book/security/configuring-content-security-policy)).

This has been addressed in version 1.1.0 of the plugin, and it will now request that users change the Content-Security-Policy option in Jenkins.

### Perforce Plugin uses ineffective credentials encryption

**SECURITY-373
/
CVE-2018-1000145**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`perforce`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/perforce)**

**Description:**

Perforce Plugin encrypts its credentials using DES and an encryption key stored in its public source code, so it only serves as basic obfuscation.
This allowed users with Jenkins controller local file system access and Jenkins administrators to retrieve the stored password.
The latter could result in exposure of the passwords through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
The plugin has been removed from publication at the request of its former maintainers.
We recommend that users of Perforce Plugin use the [P4 Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/p4) instead.

### vSphere Plugin does not validate SSL/TLS certificates

**SECURITY-504
/
CVE-2018-1000151**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`vsphere-cloud`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/vsphere-cloud)**

**Description:**

vSphere Plugin disabled SSL/TLS certificate validation unconditionally, allowing potential man-in-the-middle attacks.

vSphere Plugin 2.17 now has SSL/TLS certificate validation enabled by default.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in vSphere Plugin form validation allowed enumerating credentials IDs, capturing credentials, and denial of service

**SECURITY-745
/
CVE-2018-1000152 and CVE-2018-1000153**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`vsphere-cloud`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/vsphere-cloud)**

**Description:**

vSphere Plugin did not perform permission checks on methods implementing form validation.
This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to perform various actions such as:

* Connect to an attacker-specified vSphere server using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins
* Connect to configured vSphere servers and looking up information, potentially resulting in denial of service

Additionally, these form validation methods did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

These form validation methods now require POST requests and appropriate user permissions.

### Liquibase Runner Plugin allows users to load arbitrary Java code into controller JVM

**SECURITY-519
/
CVE-2018-1000146**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[high](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`liquibase-runner`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/liquibase-runner)**

**Description:**

Liquibase Runner Plugin allows users with Job/Configure permission to configure its build step in a way that loads arbitrary class files into the Jenkins controller JVM, resulting in arbitrary code execution.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Perforce Plugin credentials can be obtained by users with Job/Extended Read permission

**SECURITY-536
/
CVE-2018-1000147**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`perforce`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/perforce)**

**Description:**

Jenkins prevents users with Extended Read permission from obtaining secrets such as credentials stored in job configurations.

Perforce Plugin implements its own credential encryption using DES and an encryption key stored in its public source code.
This is not considered a secret by Jenkins, resulting in potential exposure of Perforce credentials stored in job configurations to users with Extended Read permission.
While these are encrypted, this can only be considered basic obfuscation due to the hard-coded public encryption key used.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
The plugin has been removed from publication at the request of its maintainers.
We recommend that users of Perforce Plugin use the [P4 Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/p4) instead.

### Copy To Slave Plugin allows access to arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system

**SECURITY-545
/
CVE-2018-1000148**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`copy-to-slave`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/copy-to-slave)**

**Description:**

Copy To Slave Plugin allows users with Job/Configure permissions to configure it in such a way that it allows obtaining arbitrary files accessible to the Jenkins controller process from the Jenkins controller file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Ansible Plugin disabled host key verification by default

**SECURITY-630
/
CVE-2018-1000149**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`ansible`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ansible)**

**Description:**

Ansible Plugin disabled host key verification by default, having it only as an opt-in option.

Ansible Plugin 1.0 now enables host key verification by default, adding options allowing users to opt out.

Existing configurations that previously did not opt into host key verification will have host key verification enabled after update, possibly resulting in failures.

### Reverse Proxy Auth persisted authorities cache on disk

**SECURITY-736
/
CVE-2018-1000150**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`reverse-proxy-auth-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/reverse-proxy-auth-plugin)**

**Description:**

Reverse Proxy Auth Plugin persisted a cache of granted authorities (group memberships) on disk.

This could allow users with local Jenkins controller file system access to obtain group membership information of Jenkins users.

Reverse Proxy Auth Plugin 1.6.0 and newer no longer store the cache of granted authorities on disk.

### Mailer Plugin allowed unauthorized users to send test emails

**SECURITY-774
/
CVE-2018-8718**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`mailer`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/mailer)**

**Description:**

A missing permission check in Mailer Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to have it connect to a user-specified mail server with user-specified credentials to send a test email to a user-specified email address.
The email subject and body could not be changed.
This could result in DoS if, for example, specifying a valid mail server but invalid credentials.

As the same URL did not require POST to be used, it also was vulnerable to cross-site request forgery.

The URL handling test emails now requires POST to protect from CSRF, and performs an Overall/Administer permission check.
