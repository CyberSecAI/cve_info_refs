The provided content is related to the following CVE: CVE-2018-1000516

The document describes multiple security vulnerabilities fixed in the Galaxy platform, which include:

**1. Arbitrary Code Execution**
   - **Root Cause:** Gaps in Galaxy's command-line template parameter sanitization. Although form fields were sanitized for shell metacharacters, some parameters passed to tools on the command line (e.g., input dataset names) were not.
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Insufficient sanitization of command-line parameters, allowing injection of malicious code.
   - **Impact of Exploitation:** Allows a malicious user to execute arbitrary code on the Galaxy server.
   - **Attack Vectors:** Manipulating dataset names or other fields that are used as command-line parameters.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to have the ability to provide crafted input parameters to tools.

**2. Cross-site Scripting (XSS)**
   - **Root Cause:** Improper sanitization of user input in many templates used by the Galaxy server.
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of proper input sanitization, making the application vulnerable to XSS attacks.
   - **Impact of Exploitation:** Malicious users can execute arbitrary JavaScript by crafting specific URLs, gaining access to user or administrator accounts.
   - **Attack Vectors:** Creation of malicious URLs that, when accessed, execute malicious Javascript.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs the ability to create and disseminate malicious URLs.

**3. OpenID Redirect**
  -  **Root Cause**: Insufficient validation of redirect URLs in OpenID authentication methods.
  - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Malicious redirection vulnerability, potentially tricking users to enter credentials on a fake Galaxy server
  -  **Impact of Exploitation**: An attacker could redirect a user to a malicious site mimicking the Galaxy login page, potentially stealing credentials.
  -  **Attack Vectors:** Manipulating the redirect URL during the authentication process.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept or manipulate the OpenID authentication process.

**4. Mobile Galaxy XSS**
  -  **Root Cause**: The mobile interface was also vulnerable to XSS attacks.
  -  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of input sanitization in the mobile interface.
   -  **Impact of Exploitation:** Similar to the general XSS vulnerability, could lead to arbitrary Javascript execution.
  -  **Attack Vectors:** Creation of malicious URLs that target the mobile interface.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  The attacker needs to create malicious URLs accessible by mobile users.

The document also mentions that the mobile interface was disabled due to being outdated and unusable. The fix for the arbitrary code execution vulnerability was backported to earlier releases starting from January 13, 2013.
