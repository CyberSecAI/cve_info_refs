Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000868:

**Verification:**

The provided content explicitly mentions **CVE-2018-1000868** in relation to WeBid and identifies it as a vulnerability related to **Blind SQL Injection**. This matches the provided content, which provides detailed information regarding the SQL Injection vulnerability.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input parameters in several PHP scripts (`yourauctions.php`, `yourauctions_c.php`, `yourauctions_p.php`, `yourauctions_s.php`, `yourauctions_sold.php`).
- Specifically, the `oa_ord`, `ca_ord`, `pa_ord`, `sa_ord`, and `solda_ord` parameters, which control the ordering of auction results, are directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Blind SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection because it does not sanitize or validate the aforementioned parameters before using them in SQL queries. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through these parameters. This is a blind SQL injection because the results are not directly visible to the attacker but can be inferred through application behavior, such as response times or error messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Data Exposure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to potentially read data from the database, including sensitive information such as password hashes, user details, and other application secrets.
- **Unauthorized Access:** With access to database contents, an attacker could potentially escalate privileges or gain unauthorized access to other parts of the application or system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Requests:** The attacker sends crafted GET requests to the vulnerable scripts with malicious SQL code injected into the `oa_ord`, `ca_ord`, `pa_ord`, `sa_ord`, or `solda_ord` parameters.
- **Authenticated User:** Exploitation of these vulnerabilities requires the attacker to be a logged-in user of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid user account to access the vulnerable scripts related to the "Your Auctions" functionality.
- **Knowledge of SQL Injection Techniques:** The attacker needs to be familiar with blind SQL injection techniques to craft payloads that can extract information from the database despite not receiving explicit SQL output in the HTTP response.
