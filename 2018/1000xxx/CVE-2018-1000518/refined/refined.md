Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000518:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `websockets` library, specifically version 4.0, was vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to memory exhaustion. This occurred because the library didn't enforce a `max_size` limit when decompressing compressed messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The primary weakness was the absence of a size limit during decompression of websocket messages. This allowed an attacker to send specially crafted compressed messages that would expand to consume excessive memory.
*   **Memory Exhaustion Vulnerability:** The library was vulnerable to memory exhaustion by processing a compressed message that, upon decompression, would require an unreasonable amount of memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service by exhausting the server's memory, making the server unresponsive to legitimate requests. This vulnerability would render the server unable to handle websocket requests.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Crafted Compressed Messages:** The attack vector involves an attacker sending a compressed websocket message carefully crafted to decompress to a very large size that will exhaust the available memory of the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Send WebSocket Messages:** An attacker needs the capability to establish a WebSocket connection with the vulnerable server and send messages.
*   **Understanding of Compression and Payload Size:** The attacker requires the capability to construct a malicious compressed message designed to cause an excessive memory allocation after decompression, also known as a zip bomb.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability involved enforcing a `max_size` limit during decompression of compressed messages.
*   The vulnerability was also found in competing libraries and the maintainers were contacted.
*   A similar fix was implemented in the Tornado web framework.
*   The issue was assigned CVE-2018-1000518.
