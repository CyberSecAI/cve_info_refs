Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `Redirection` plugin failing to properly sanitize user-supplied data before passing it to the `maybe_unserialize()` function. This function attempts to convert a serialized string back into a PHP object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unsafe Deserialization:** The core issue is the use of `maybe_unserialize()` on unsanitized user input. This allows an attacker to inject a specially crafted serialized PHP object.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The `action_data` parameter, which is passed to the `maybe_unserialize` function, is not sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious serialized data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By crafting a malicious serialized object, an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This can lead to full compromise of the WordPress website.
*   **Complete System Takeover**: An attacker can gain control over the server, potentially leading to data breaches, defacement, malware injection and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **AJAX Request:** The attack vector is via an AJAX request to `admin-ajax.php`, using the `red_ajax_set_redirect` action. This is typically done by an authenticated administrator.
*   **`action_data` parameter:** The malicious serialized PHP object is injected into the `action_data` parameter of the AJAX request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrator Access:** The attacker must have administrator-level privileges on the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of PHP Serialization:** The attacker needs to be familiar with PHP object serialization to create the malicious payload.
*   **Access to Admin Dashboard:** Attackers should be able to access the WordPress admin dashboard and send the crafted AJAX request.
*  **Available Classes:** The feasibility of achieving arbitrary code execution depends on the availability of classes (i.e. which plugins and themes are installed and active).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided proof of concept demonstrates passing an arbitrary string to the `maybe_unserialize()` function. Achieving full arbitrary code execution depends on the specific classes available on the WordPress site.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.8 of the plugin.
*  The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 9, indicating high severity.
