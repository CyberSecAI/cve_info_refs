Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000422:

**CVE-2018-1000422: Server-side request forgery vulnerability in Crowd 2 Integration Plugin**

*   **Root Cause:** The Crowd 2 Integration Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL with attacker-specified credentials and connection settings.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing Permission Check:** The plugin's form validation method lacked proper permission checks, allowing unauthorized users to trigger connections to arbitrary URLs.
    *   **CSRF vulnerability**: The form validation method did not require POST requests making it vulnerable to CSRF.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker could make the Jenkins server connect to an arbitrary URL under the attacker's control, potentially gaining access to internal resources or services not directly accessible by the attacker.
    *   An attacker could use the Jenkins server as a proxy for other attacks.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   A remote attacker with Overall/Read access to Jenkins can exploit this vulnerability.
    *   The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permissions within the Jenkins environment.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL to initiate a server-side request forgery.

**Additional Details:**

The advisory also mentions that this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. This, combined with the lack of permission checks, allowed an attacker to make the Jenkins server connect to an attacker-specified URL by tricking a legitimate user into making the request.

The fix for this vulnerability involves adding permission checks to this form validation method and requiring POST requests to be sent.
