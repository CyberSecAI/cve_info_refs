## Responsible disclosure policy

Please report issues to security@fatfreecrm.com. We will work with you to understand the issue and how we can fix it. Please do not disclose the issue publicly until it has been resolved and released. We're more than willing to give you credit for discovering the issue, once it has been patched and announced, but until then we ask that you consider the security implications of the issue you have found and the impact on others using an un-patched system.
