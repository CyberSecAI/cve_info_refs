Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-1000646:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of the `file_put_contents` function in the `import_template.php` file of the lh-ehr application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unrestricted File Write:** The application allows an attacker to write arbitrary content to arbitrary files on the server, as the filename and content are taken directly from user-controlled `$_POST` parameters without proper sanitization or validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By writing a PHP file containing malicious code to a location accessible by the webserver, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to complete compromise of the system.
- **Data Breach/Manipulation:** Attackers could overwrite existing files to disrupt service or inject malicious scripts into data files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a malicious POST request to `import_template.php`, with the `docid` parameter specifying the file path and the `content` parameter containing the malicious content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the vulnerable functionality in `import_template.php`.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
