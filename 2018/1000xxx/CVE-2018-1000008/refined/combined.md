## Description

### XXE vulnerabilities in multiple static analysis plugins

* **SECURITY-655 / CVE-2018-1000008** (PMD)
* **SECURITY-656 / CVE-2018-1000009** (Checkstyle)
* **SECURITY-657 / CVE-2018-1000010** (DRY)
* **SECURITY-658 / CVE-2018-1000011** (FindBugs)
* **SECURITY-695 / CVE-2018-1000012** (Warnings)

Multiple plugins based on [Static Analysis Utilities](https://plugins.jenkins.io/analysis-core) plugin are affected by an XML External Entity (XXE) processing vulnerability.
This allows attacker to configure build processes such that one of these plugins parses a maliciously crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

External entity resolution has been disabled for these plugins.

### CSRF vulnerability in Release plugin

**SECURITY-607 / CVE-2018-1000013**

Release plugin did not require form submissions to be submitted via POST, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability allowing attackers to trigger release builds.

Access to the form action URL now requires POST.

### CSRF vulnerability in Translation Assistance plugin

**SECURITY-507 / CVE-2018-1000014**

Translation Assistance plugin did not require form submissions to be submitted via POST, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability allowing attackers to override localized strings displayed to all users on the current Jenkins instance if the victim is a Jenkins administrator.

Access to the form action URL now requires POST.

### Incorrect permission checks in Pipeline: Nodes and Processes plugin allows executing builds on agents while lacking Computer/Build permission

**SECURITY-675 / CVE-2018-1000015**

On instances with [Authorize Project plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/authorize-project), the authentication associated with a build may lack the Computer/Build permission on some agents.
This did not prevent the execution of `node` blocks on those agents due to incorrect permissions checks in Pipeline: Nodes and Processes plugin.

Build permissions on agents are now properly enforced for `node` steps.

### XSS vulnerability in job configuration forms in Ant plugin

**SECURITY-624 and SECURITY-694**

Ant plugin failed to escape tool names it shows on job configuration screens, resulting in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that is exploitable only by Jenkins administrators.

This is the same vulnerability that was announced without a fix on [2017-12-05](/security/advisory/2017-12-05/).
Contrary to what we wrote in that security advisory, Ant Plugin shows both the JDK and Ant tools on the configuration screen, and the vulnerability in Ant plugin was responsible for both problems we confirmed in the previous advisory.

Ant plugin now correctly escapes tool names shown on the job configuration screen.

# Translation Assistance

How to install

**Deprecated:** This plugin has been marked as [deprecated](https://jenkins.io/doc/developer/plugin-governance/deprecating-or-removing-plugin). In general, this means that this plugin is either obsolete, no longer being developed, or may no longer work.

More information about the cause of this deprecation, and suggestions on how to proceed may be found at <https://github.com/jenkins-infra/update-center2/pull/719>.

* [Documentation](/translation/)
* [Releases](/translation/releases/)
* [Issues](/translation/issues/)
* [Dependencies](/translation/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/translation/healthscore/)

**The server handling submitted translations has been shut down.** While
this plugin is still useful for local translations, it's not possible to
submit translations to the Jenkins project anymore.

This plugin adds an additional dialog box in every page, which enables
people to contribute localizations for the messages they are seeing in
the current page.This reduces the barrier of entry to localization, and
by showing messages in the context of a page, it should also improve the
quality of the translation.

## How does it work?

Browse any page of Jenkins, and you'll see a link in the footer section
that opens the translation dialog.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/translation/docs/images/l10n-link.png)

Click this link, and you'll see an inline dialog box.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/translation/docs/images/l10n-dialog.png)

Choose the locale that you'd like to contribute, then type the
translation text. The message follows the format of
[`MessageFormat`](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/text/MessageFormat.html),
and in particular,

1. Markers like "{0}" and "{1}" represent the arguments
2. Single quote (') needs to be escaped as two single-quote ('')

   Your name allows us to recognize your contributions and bypass
   manual review, especially when you've been contributing in the past.
   So do supply some unique string, even if it's not your real name.

   If you have an administrative access to the Jenkins instance, your
   contributions will be reflected right away — just reload the page to
   see the effect. (If you do not have the access, your changes won't
   be reflected to the running instance for security reasons, but
   nonetheless they are sent to the Jenkins server.)

Your contributions are also sent to the Jenkins project for inclusion in
future versions of Jenkins.
