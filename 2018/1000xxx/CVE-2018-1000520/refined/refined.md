The provided content is related to CVE-2018-1000520.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Mbed TLS incorrectly accepting ECDSA-signed certificates when the negotiated cipher suite is of the TLS-ECDH-RSA-* type, which is meant to use RSA-signed certificates. This violates RFC 4492 which specifies that in ECDH-RSA key exchange, the certificate MUST be signed with RSA.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper validation of certificate signature algorithm during TLS handshake.
- Violation of RFC 4492 regarding the use of RSA-signed certificates for ECDH-RSA cipher suites.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious actor could potentially use an ECDSA-signed certificate with a TLS-ECDH-RSA-* cipher suite. This could lead to unexpected behavior, potential handshake failures or, in certain scenarios, potential security compromise if other parts of the system or application rely on the specific signature algorithm.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle attack where an attacker presents a certificate signed with ECDSA instead of RSA during the TLS handshake.
- A malicious server may present an ECDSA-signed certificate to a vulnerable client during the handshake.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept or control the TLS handshake between client and server, allowing them to present a malicious certificate.
- The attacker requires an ECDSA signed certificate which the vulnerable peer will incorrectly accept.
