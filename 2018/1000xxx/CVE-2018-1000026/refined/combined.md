Yes, so it looks to me we should do the check in e.g netif_needs_gso()
before passing it to hardware. And bnx2x needs to set its gso_max_size
correctly.

Btw, looks like this could be triggered from a guest which is a DOS. We
need request a CVE for this.

Thanks

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## 标题

An update for kernel-alt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## 描述

The kernel-alt packages provide the Linux kernel version 4.x.

Security Fix(es):

* An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of Load & Store instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory read from address to which a recent memory write has occurred may see an older value and subsequently cause an update into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3639, aarch64)
* A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port, thus the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2018-5390)
* A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithm by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2018-5391)

Space precludes documenting all of the security fixes in this advisory. See the descriptions of the remaining security fixes in the related Knowledge Article:

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 17.10

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1547824#c0)  Sam Fowler    2018-02-22 03:32:40 UTC  ``` The Linux kernel at version 4.15.0-rc9 is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference ip6_tables.c:ip6t_do_table() leading to a crash. This vulnerability is only present under certain malformed iptables rulesets.  Inserting malformed rules its a privileged operation as root or a user with CAP_NET_RAW,CAP_NET_ADMIN capabilities ( see man setcap(8) ).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu

14.04 LTS.

Jann Horn discovered that the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) implementation

in the Linux kernel improperly performed sign extension in some situations.

A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-16995](/security/CVE-2017-16995))

It was discovered that a race condition leading to a use-after-free

vulnerability existed in the ALSA PCM subsystem of the Linux kernel. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-0861](/security/CVE-2017-0861))

It was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel allowed

passthrough of the diagnostic I/O port 0x80. An attacker in a guest VM

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the host OS.

([CVE-2017-1000407](/security/CVE-2017-1000407))

It was discovered that an information disclosure vulnerability existed in

the ACPI implementation of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use

this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory addresses).

([CVE-2017-11472](/security/CVE-2017-11472))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the

network namespaces implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-15129](/security/CVE-2017-15129))

It was discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free when handling

device removal. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2017-16528](/security/CVE-2017-16528))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the usbtest device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate endpoint metadata. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2017-16532](/security/CVE-2017-16532))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the Conexant cx231xx USB video capture

driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate interface descriptors.

A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2017-16536](/security/CVE-2017-16536))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the SoundGraph iMON USB driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically

proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2017-16537](/security/CVE-2017-16537))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the IMS Passenger Control Unit USB driver

in the Linux kernel did not properly validate device descriptors. A

physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2017-16645](/security/CVE-2017-16645))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the DiBcom DiB0700 USB DVB driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly handle detach events. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2017-16646](/security/CVE-2017-16646))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the CDC USB Ethernet driver did not

properly validate device descriptors. A physically proximate attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-16649](/security/CVE-2017-16649))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the QMI WWAN USB driver did not properly

validate device descriptors. A physically proximate attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-16650](/security/CVE-2017-16650))

It was discovered that the USB Virtual Host Controller Interface (VHCI)

driver in the Linux kernel contained an information disclosure

vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2017-16911](/security/CVE-2017-16911))

It was discovered that the USB over IP implementation in the Linux kernel

did not validate endpoint numbers. A remote attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-16912](/security/CVE-2017-16912))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# USN-3620-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

4 April 2018

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

It was discovered that the netlink 802.11 configuration interface in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate some attributes passed from

userspace. A local attacker with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN privilege could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2017-11089](/security/CVE-2017-11089))

It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the ioctl handling code

in the ISDN subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2017-12762](/security/CVE-2017-12762))

It was discovered that the netfilter component of the Linux did not

properly restrict access to the connection tracking helpers list. A local

attacker could use this to bypass intended access restrictions.

([CVE-2017-17448](/security/CVE-2017-17448))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel

contained an out-of-bounds read when handling memory-mapped I/O. A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2017-17741](/security/CVE-2017-17741))

It was discovered that the Salsa20 encryption algorithm implementations in

the Linux kernel did not properly handle zero-length inputs. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2017-17805](/security/CVE-2017-17805))

It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly check permissions when a key request was performed on a

task's default keyring. A local attacker could use this to add keys to

unauthorized keyrings. ([CVE-2017-17807](/security/CVE-2017-17807))

It was discovered that the Broadcom NetXtremeII ethernet driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate Generic Segment Offload (GSO) packet

sizes. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (interface

unavailability). ([CVE-2018-1000026](/security/CVE-2018-1000026))

It was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Socket (RDS) implementation in

the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write during RDMA page

allocation. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5332](/security/CVE-2018-5332))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.13.0-1012-gcp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-gcp)
  -
  [4.13.0-1012.16](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-gcp/4.13.0-1012.16)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-1022-oem](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-oem)
  -
  [4.13.0-1022.24](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-oem/4.13.0-1022.24)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-38-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.13.0-38.43~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.13.0-38.43~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-38-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.13.0-38.43~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.13.0-38.43~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-4.13.0-38-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe)
  -
  [4.13.0-38.43~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-hwe/4.13.0-38.43~16.04.1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithm by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2018-5391)
* kernel: out-of-bounds access in the show\_timer function in kernel/time/posix-timers.c (CVE-2017-18344)
* kernel: Integer overflow in udl\_fb\_mmap() can allow attackers to execute code in kernel space (CVE-2018-8781)
* kernel: MIDI driver race condition leads to a double-free (CVE-2018-10902)
* kernel: Missing check in inode\_init\_owner() does not clear SGID bit on non-directories for non-members (CVE-2018-13405)
* kernel: AIO write triggers integer overflow in some protocols (CVE-2015-8830)
* kernel: Use-after-free in snd\_pcm\_info function in ALSA subsystem potentially leads to privilege escalation (CVE-2017-0861)
* kernel: Handling of might\_cancel queueing is not properly pretected against race (CVE-2017-10661)
* kernel: Salsa20 encryption algorithm does not correctly handle zero-length inputs allowing local attackers to cause denial of service (CVE-2017-17805)
* kernel: Inifinite loop vulnerability in madvise\_willneed() function allows local denial of service (CVE-2017-18208)
* kernel: fuse-backed file mmap-ed onto process cmdline arguments causes denial of service (CVE-2018-1120)
* kernel: a null pointer dereference in dccp\_write\_xmit() leads to a system crash (CVE-2018-1130)
* kernel: drivers/block/loop.c mishandles lo\_release serialization allowing denial of service (CVE-2018-5344)
* kernel: Missing length check of payload in \_sctp\_make\_chunk() function allows denial of service (CVE-2018-5803)
* kernel: buffer overflow in drivers/net/wireless/ath/wil6210/wmi.c:wmi\_set\_ie() may lead to memory corruption (CVE-2018-5848)
* kernel: out-of-bound write in ext4\_init\_block\_bitmap function with a crafted ext4 image (CVE-2018-10878)
* kernel: Improper validation in bnx2x network card driver can allow for denial of service attacks via crafted packet (CVE-2018-1000026)
* kernel: Information leak when handling NM entries containing NUL (CVE-2016-4913)
* kernel: Mishandling mutex within libsas allowing local Denial of Service (CVE-2017-18232)
* kernel: NULL pointer dereference in ext4\_process\_freed\_data() when mounting crafted ext4 image (CVE-2018-1092)
* kernel: NULL pointer dereference in ext4\_xattr\_inode\_hash() causes crash with crafted ext4 image (CVE-2018-1094)
* kernel: vhost: Information disclosure in vhost/vhost.c:vhost\_new\_msg() (CVE-2018-1118)
* kernel: Denial of service in resv\_map\_release function in mm/hugetlb.c (CVE-2018-7740)
* kernel: Memory leak in the sas\_smp\_get\_phy\_events function in drivers/scsi/libsas/sas\_expander.c (CVE-2018-7757)
* kernel: Invalid pointer dereference in xfs\_ilock\_attr\_map\_shared() when mounting crafted xfs image allowing denial of service (CVE-2018-10322)
* kernel: use-after-free detected in ext4\_xattr\_set\_entry with a crafted file (CVE-2018-10879)
* kernel: out-of-bound access in ext4\_get\_group\_info() when mounting and operating a crafted ext4 image (CVE-2018-10881)
* kernel: stack-out-of-bounds write in jbd2\_journal\_dirty\_metadata function (CVE-2018-10883)
* kernel: incorrect memory bounds check in drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c (CVE-2018-10940)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-trusty](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-trusty) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty for Precise ESM

## Details

USN-3620-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 14.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for Ubuntu

12.04 ESM.

Jann Horn discovered that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution

and branch prediction may allow unauthorized memory reads via sidechannel

attacks. This flaw is known as Spectre. A local attacker could use this to

expose sensitive information, including kernel memory. ([CVE-2017-5715](/security/CVE-2017-5715))

It was discovered that the netlink 802.11 configuration interface in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate some attributes passed from

userspace. A local attacker with the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN privilege could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2017-11089](/security/CVE-2017-11089))

It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the ioctl handling code

in the ISDN subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2017-12762](/security/CVE-2017-12762))

It was discovered that the netfilter component of the Linux did not

properly restrict access to the connection tracking helpers list. A local

attacker could use this to bypass intended access restrictions.

([CVE-2017-17448](/security/CVE-2017-17448))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel

contained an out-of-bounds read when handling memory-mapped I/O. A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2017-17741](/security/CVE-2017-17741))

It was discovered that the Salsa20 encryption algorithm implementations in

the Linux kernel did not properly handle zero-length inputs. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2017-17805](/security/CVE-2017-17805))

It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly check permissions when a key request was performed on a

task's default keyring. A local attacker could use this to add keys to

unauthorized keyrings. ([CVE-2017-17807](/security/CVE-2017-17807))

It was discovered that the Broadcom NetXtremeII ethernet driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate Generic Segment Offload (GSO) packet

sizes. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (interface

unavailability). ([CVE-2018-1000026](/security/CVE-2018-1000026))

It was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Socket (RDS) implementation in

the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds write during RDMA page

allocation. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-5332](/security/CVE-2018-5332))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.13.0-144-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-144.193~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-144.193~precise1)
* [linux-image-generic-lpae-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0.144.135](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-144.193~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-144-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-144.193~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-144.193~precise1)
* [linux-image-generic-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0.144.135](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-144.193~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Debian Bug     : 904385 918103 922306

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2018-14625

    A use-after-free bug was found in the vhost driver for the Virtual
    Socket protocol.  If this driver is used to communicate with a
    malicious virtual machine guest, the guest could read sensitive
    information from the host kernel.

CVE-2018-16884

    A flaw was found in the NFS 4.1 client implementation. Mounting
    NFS shares in multiple network namespaces at the same time could
    lead to a user-after-free. Local users might be able to use this
    for denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

    This can be mitigated by disabling unprivileged users from
    creating user namespaces, which is the default in Debian.

CVE-2018-19824

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a use-after-free bug in the
    USB audio driver. A physically present attacker able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2018-19985

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a missing bounds check in the
    hso USB serial driver. A physically present user able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-20169

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered missing bounds checks in the
    USB core. A physically present attacker able to attach a specially
    designed USB device could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-1000026

    It was discovered that Linux could forward aggregated network
    packets with a segmentation size too large for the output device.
    In the specific case of Broadcom NetXtremeII 10Gb adapters, this
    would result in a denial of service (firmware crash).  This update
    adds a mitigation to the bnx2x driver for this hardware.

CVE-2019-3459, CVE-2019-3460

    Shlomi Oberman, Yuli Shapiro and Karamba Security Ltd. research
    team discovered missing range checks in the Bluetooth L2CAP
    implementation.  If Bluetooth is enabled, a nearby attacker
    could use these to read sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-3701

    Muyu Yu and Marcus Meissner reported that the CAN gateway
    implementation allowed the frame length to be modified, typically
    resulting in out-of-bounds memory-mapped I/O writes.  On a system
    with CAN devices present, a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability in the initial net namespace could use this to cause a
    crash (oops) or other hardware-dependent impact.

CVE-2019-3819

    A potential infinite loop was discovered in the HID debugfs
    interface exposed under /sys/kernel/debug/hid. A user with access
    to these files could use this for denial of service.

    This interface is only accessible to root by default, which fully
    mitigates the issue.

CVE-2019-6974

    Jann Horn reported a use-after-free bug in KVM. A local user
    with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-7221

    Jim Mattson and Felix Wilhelm reported a user-after-free bug in
    KVM's nested VMX implementation. On systems with Intel CPUs, a
    local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

    Nested VMX is disabled by default, which fully mitigates the
    issue.

CVE-2019-7222

    Felix Wilhelm reported an information leak in KVM for x86.
    A local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to read
    sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-8980

    A bug was discovered in the kernel_read_file() function used to
    load firmware files. In certain error conditions it could leak
    memory, which might lead to a denial of service. This is probbaly
    not exploitable in a Debian system.

CVE-2019-9213

    Jann Horn reported that privileged tasks could cause stack
    segments, including those in other processes, to grow downward to
    address 0. On systems lacking SMAP (x86) or PAN (ARM), this
    exacerbated other vulnerabilities: a null pointer dereference
    could be exploited for privilege escalation rather than only for
    denial of service.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.168-1~deb8u1.  This version also includes fixes for Debian bugs
#904385, #918103, and #922306; and other fixes included in upstream
stable updates.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.9 and linux-latest-4.9
packages.  You will need to use "apt-get upgrade --with-new-pkgs"
or "apt upgrade" as the binary package names have changed.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

If a bnx2x card is passed a GSO packet with a gso_size larger than
~9700 bytes, it will cause a firmware error that will bring the card
down:

Detect when gso_size + header length is greater than the maximum
packet size (9700 bytes) and disable GSO. For simplicity and speed
this is approximated by comparing gso_size against 9200 and assuming
no-one will have more than 500 bytes of headers.

This raises the obvious question - how do we end up with a packet with
a gso_size that's greater than 9700? This has been observed on an
powerpc system when Open vSwitch is forwarding a packet from an
ibmveth device.

ibmveth is a bit special. It's the driver for communication between
virtual machines (aka 'partitions'/LPARs) running under IBM's
proprietary hypervisor on ppc machines. It allows sending very large
packets (up to 64kB) between LPARs. This involves some quite
'interesting' things: for example, when talking TCP, the MSS is stored
the checksum field (see ibmveth_rx_mss_helper() in ibmveth.c).

Normally on a box like this, there would be a Virtual I/O Server
(VIOS) partition that owns the physical network card. VIOS lets the
AIX partitions know when they're talking to a real network and that
they should drop their MSS. This works fine if VIOS owns the physical
network card.

However, in this case, a Linux partition owns the card (this is known
as a NovaLink setup). The negotiation between VIOS and AIX uses a
non-standard TCP option, so Linux has never supported that.  Instead,
Linux just supports receiving large packets. It doesn't support any
form of messaging/MSS negotiation back to other LPARs.

To get some clarity about where the large MSS was coming from, I asked
Thomas Falcon, the maintainer of ibmveth, for some background:

"In most cases, large segments are an aggregation of smaller packets
by the Virtual I/O Server (VIOS) partition and then are forwarded to
the Linux LPAR / ibmveth driver. These segments can be as large as
64KB. In this case, since the customer is using Novalink, I believe
what is happening is pretty straightforward: the large segments are
created by the AIX partition and then forwarded to the Linux
partition, ... The ibmveth driver doesn't do any aggregation itself
but just ensures the proper bits are set before sending the frame up
to avoid giving the upper layers indigestion."

It is possible to stop AIX from sending these large segments, but it
requires configuration on each LPAR. While ibmveth's behaviour is
admittedly weird, we should fix this here: it shouldn't be possible
for it to cause a firmware panic on another card.

Why not use netif_set_gso_max_size() instead?
Some drivers are using it to avoid such larger than supported packets.

Scratch that, sorry. It doesn't take effect in forwarding path.

This is merely a question on kernel stack, how kernel might end up sending such GSO packets to the device
considering MTUs of underlined device ? Not sure if this should be handled at driver level or at kernel stack level ?

In general, when I run iperf with MTU 1500, I get gso_size as 1448.
When running with 9600 MTU, I get gso_size as 9548.

With this change, considering Jumbo MTU, even if device is able to handle a packet with gso_size like 9548, it will cause it to disable GSO
Considering jumbo frames are rare, doesn't sound well. Since there are customers/people which might be utilizing jumbo MTUs.

Thanks,
Manish

What is the MTU size configured on the bnx2x device when these 9700
byte packets are seen?

If it's less than 9700, whatever is allowing your device (openvswitch,
ibmveth, whatever) needs to be fixed.

I don't like this at all, quite frankly.  We'll have one device now that
has this special check, probably many others can run into this situation
as well but they won't be used on these kinds of powerpc boxes and
therefore nobody is going to notice.

I'm not applying this without more information or better justification,
sorry.

It still makes sense to tell TCP not to generate huge GSO packets.

For the forwarding path, there needs to be some software recovery
logic in net transmit path.

Sure, I had an approach that checks the gso_size in is_skb_forwardable
and the equivalent openvswitch path - I'll send that.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.13.0-1014-azure](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-azure)
  -
  [4.13.0-1014.17](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-azure/4.13.0-1014.17)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Topic

An update for kernel-rt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages provide the Real Time Linux Kernel, which enables fine-tuning for systems with extremely high determinism requirements.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithm by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2018-5391)
* kernel: out-of-bounds access in the show\_timer function in kernel/time/posix-timers.c (CVE-2017-18344)
* kernel: Integer overflow in udl\_fb\_mmap() can allow attackers to execute code in kernel space (CVE-2018-8781)
* kernel: MIDI driver race condition leads to a double-free (CVE-2018-10902)
* kernel: Missing check in inode\_init\_owner() does not clear SGID bit on non-directories for non-members (CVE-2018-13405)
* kernel: AIO write triggers integer overflow in some protocols (CVE-2015-8830)
* kernel: Use-after-free in snd\_pcm\_info function in ALSA subsystem potentially leads to privilege escalation (CVE-2017-0861)
* kernel: Handling of might\_cancel queueing is not properly pretected against race (CVE-2017-10661)
* kernel: Salsa20 encryption algorithm does not correctly handle zero-length inputs allowing local attackers to cause denial of service (CVE-2017-17805)
* kernel: Inifinite loop vulnerability in madvise\_willneed() function allows local denial of service (CVE-2017-18208)
* kernel: fuse-backed file mmap-ed onto process cmdline arguments causes denial of service (CVE-2018-1120)
* kernel: a null pointer dereference in dccp\_write\_xmit() leads to a system crash (CVE-2018-1130)
* kernel: drivers/block/loop.c mishandles lo\_release serialization allowing denial of service (CVE-2018-5344)
* kernel: Missing length check of payload in \_sctp\_make\_chunk() function allows denial of service (CVE-2018-5803)
* kernel: buffer overflow in drivers/net/wireless/ath/wil6210/wmi.c:wmi\_set\_ie() may lead to memory corruption (CVE-2018-5848)
* kernel: out-of-bound write in ext4\_init\_block\_bitmap function with a crafted ext4 image (CVE-2018-10878)
* kernel: Improper validation in bnx2x network card driver can allow for denial of service attacks via crafted packet (CVE-2018-1000026)
* kernel: Information leak when handling NM entries containing NUL (CVE-2016-4913)
* kernel: Mishandling mutex within libsas allowing local Denial of Service (CVE-2017-18232)
* kernel: NULL pointer dereference in ext4\_process\_freed\_data() when mounting crafted ext4 image (CVE-2018-1092)
* kernel: NULL pointer dereference in ext4\_xattr\_inode\_hash() causes crash with crafted ext4 image (CVE-2018-1094)
* kernel: vhost: Information disclosure in vhost.c:vhost\_new\_msg() (CVE-2018-1118)
* kernel: Denial of service in resv\_map\_release function in mm/hugetlb.c (CVE-2018-7740)
* kernel: Memory leak in the sas\_smp\_get\_phy\_events function in drivers/scsi/libsas/sas\_expander.c (CVE-2018-7757)
* kernel: Invalid pointer dereference in xfs\_ilock\_attr\_map\_shared() when mounting crafted xfs image allowing denial of service (CVE-2018-10322)
* kernel: use-after-free detected in ext4\_xattr\_set\_entry with a crafted file (CVE-2018-10879)
* kernel: out-of-bound access in ext4\_get\_group\_info() when mounting and operating a crafted ext4 image (CVE-2018-10881)
* kernel: stack-out-of-bounds write in jbd2\_journal\_dirty\_metadata function (CVE-2018-10883)
* kernel: incorrect memory bounds check in drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c (CVE-2018-10940)

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1542494#c0)  Jiří Mencák    2018-02-06 13:03:01 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1392047](attachment.cgi?id=1392047 "Nova compute log file from the physical host, where the instance failed to launch.") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1392047&action=edit "Nova compute log file from the physical host, where the instance failed to launch.") Nova compute log file from the physical host, where the instance failed to launch.  Description of problem: On OSP11, VMs with NVMe devices passed through, VMs sometimes fail to be launched:  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): OSP11  How reproducible: Always   Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create a small OCP11 environment with at least 1 baremetal host allowing NVMe disk passthrough. 2. Create an openstack server/VM with the NVMe device, this should work and the VM land on the baremetal host containing the passed-through NVMe device. 3. "openstack server delete" the newly created VM. 4. Try to 2. again.  This will likely fail.  Nova log attached (56700a77-c88e-40ce-9748-ab8373a06bf1).  Actual results: The VM fails to be created.  A work-around seems to be reboot of the physical host and 5-10 minut wait before retrying.  Expected results: The VM is created successfully with no workarounds.

Anything above a value of 2 here is undefined.  A value of 127 indicates that -1 is read from PCI config space and as with private [comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1542494#c3), we can see that the device no longer responds to config accesses.  Often when this occurs it means that the device failed to return after reset.  There's not enough information provided to determine what sort of reset vfio might be attempting on the device.  Please provide lspci -vvv for the device.  144d:a804 is a Samsung "NVMe SSD Controller SM961/PM961".  We have other reports of Samsung NVMe controllers also failing with assignment, see [bug 1500825](show_bug.cgi?id=1500825).

I've managed to work-around the problem with PCI device by first stopping the VMs by "openstack server stop <server_id>" and then "openstack server delete <server_id>".  That way the PCI device never enters "!!! Unknown header type 7f" state.  Similarly, with "virsh shutdown <server_id>" I've never seen the PCI device enter the "failed" state, however I did see it enter the state every time I simply "virsh destroy <server_id> --graceful".  However, this bug is likely to be more than just the issues with the PCI device.  "openstack server delete <server_id>" can leave virsh instances on the computes both either "shut off" or "running" depending whether they were first stopped by "openstack server stop <server_id>" or not respectively, while the nova database is already updated with the "vm_state" == "deleted" (which is clearly not the case).   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1542494#c8)  Jiří Mencák    2018-02-10 20:12:47 UTC  ``` Even though there are available hosts with valid/available PCI devices to be passed through (and also nova DB confirms that):  MariaDB [nova]> select compute_node_id, address, product_id, vendor_id, status from pci_devices; +-----------------+--------------+------------+-----------+-----------+ | compute_node_id | address      | product_id | vendor_id | status    | +-----------------+--------------+------------+-----------+-----------+ |              14 | 0000:01:00.0 | a804       | 144d      | allocated | |              17 | 0000:01:00.0 | a804       | 144d      | available | |              20 | 0000:01:00.0 | a804       | 144d      | allocated | +-----------------+--------------+------------+-----------+-----------+ 3 rows in set (0.00 sec)  pci_passthrough_filter.py can fail with  2018-02-10 20:00:21.122 235395 INFO nova.filters [req-ccb2389d-9e1c-4db7-8caa-0a3a9ec00812 a042dcdcf9e84e78a9e96620814b1a4c 508d3035cc2b4c9f9d154302afd03ff2 - - -] Filter PciPassthroughFilter  returned 0 hosts 2018-02-10 20:00:21.124 235395 INFO nova.filters [req-ccb2389d-9e1c-4db7-8caa-0a3a9ec00812 a042dcdcf9e84e78a9e96620814b1a4c 508d3035cc2b4c9f9d154302afd03ff2 - - -] Filtering removed all hosts for the request with instance ID '83fd30cd-99ab-44d6-ba0c-760145bd43a8'.

Libvirt complains "Failed to reset PCI device: internal error: Unknown PCI header type '127'", which is consistent to what lspci reports. That is both libvirt and lspci report the same result.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1542494#c13)  Laine Stump    2018-02-19 17:35:35 UTC  ``` Note that even though libvirt is reporting "Failed to reset PCI device", it actually never would have tried to reset the device even if it saw a correct device type in the PCI config - it's just that libvirt's virPCIDeviceReset() function is called unconditionally for every assigned PCI devices, then does several preliminary checks before deciding whether or not to reset the PCI device itself; it happens that the very first check is to examine the device type (in the device's PCI config in sysfs) to see if it's an endpoint device (if it's not an endpoint device, that's considered an error, since libvirt only assigns endpoint devices), and the *last* check is to see if the device is bound to vfio-pci and, if so, skip reset and return success (since vfio handles any necessary device resets as appropriate). So libvirt just doesn't get a chance to *skip* device reset.  libvirt could re-order these checks, looking for use of vfio-pci *first*, and avoid this on particular error, but that would just be delaying the failure report, not actually preventing it.  Also, in terms of interaction with vfio and the device, this happens after the qemu process has been terminated, and before any other device-related action by libvirt. If lspci doesn't show the invalid device type while the guest is running, then my suspicion is that the failure is caused by whatever action is taken (by qemu->vfio->kernel) as the qemu process is terminating. I would wager that the problem (invalid device type in PCI config after terminating the guest) can be reproduced with a straight qemu command, with no libvirt involved.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1542494#c14)  Jiří Mencák    2018-02-19 19:04:11 UTC  ``` I can confirm that lspci doesn't show the invalid device type while the guest is running.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1542494#c15)  Laine Stump    2018-02-19 22:49:31 UTC  ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1542494#c7) leads me to believe that the NVMe device may be somehow dependent on the guest OS properly shutting down / releasing the device (which of course should never be the case).  I think the best course of action is to send this BZ to the kernel, but before that I can think of one experiment that could conclusively rule out libvirt as the source/trigger of any misbehavior, and also possibly help to narrow down the scope of investigation for the kernel person who looks at it:  Once a guest is running 1) stop libvirtd.service, then 2) manually kill the qemu process, then 3) look at lspci for the device.

Hi Alex,  Can you verify the vendor:device ID of your NVMe drive is 144d:a804, this should be found in 'lspci -nnks 1:00.0'.  I found a reproducible case of this myself recently and have a patch pending upstream that disables the nvme controller before reset on this device.  If it matches, I'll provide a backport to 7.5 host kernel that I'd appreciate testing.

I then ran through a serial set of commands to boot an instance with pci passthrough and then deleted 5 times.  This was run serially since there is only a single nvme on the compute thus the sequence resembled - boot instance w/ nvme, delete instance, boot instance w/nvme, delete instance  At the conclusion the nvme on the compute node never showed the error condition on the hypervisor and the instances never showed up as error state either.  Output and commands here: <https://gist.github.com/akrzos/b5cf6bf5b8492868180fabf791b2ad88>  I believe this concludes that the patched kernel is not affected.  I am installing the kernel on the rest of the compute nodes to have more exhaustive testing and to avoid the error condition in this testbed.  I also wanted to point, running the same sequence on un-patched hypervisors results in the second instance unable to boot and the following output on the un-patched compute nodes as previous discussed in this bz: [root@overcloud-compute-1 ~]# lspci -vvv -s 0000:01: 01:00.0 Non-Volatile memory controller: Samsung Electronics Co Ltd NVMe SSD Controller SM961/PM961 (rev ff) (prog-if ff)         !!!

Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Check gso_size of packets when forwarding

When regular packets are forwarded, we validate their size against the
MTU of the destination device. However, when GSO packets are
forwarded, we do not validate their size against the MTU. We
implicitly assume that when they are segmented, the resultant packets
will be correctly sized.

This is not always the case.

We observed a case where a packet received on an ibmveth device had a
GSO size of around 10kB. This was forwarded by Open vSwitch to a bnx2x
device, where it caused a firmware assert. This is described in detail
at [0] and was the genesis of this series. Rather than fixing it in
the driver, this series fixes the forwarding path.

To fix this:

 - Move a helper in patch 1.

 - Validate GSO segment lengths in is_skb_forwardable() in the GSO
   case, rather than assuming all will be well. This fixes bridges.
   This is patch 2.

 - Open vSwitch uses its own slightly specialised algorithm for
   checking lengths. Wire up checking for that in patch 3.

## Overview

Two security flaws named SegmentSmack and FragmentSmack were recently found in the Linux kernel.

A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system with relatively small bandwidth of the incoming network traffic. In a worst case scenario, an attacker can stall an affected host or device with less than 2 kpps of an attack traffic. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port, thus the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses.

A result of the attack with 4 streams can look like a complete saturation of 4 CPU cores and delays in a network packets processing:

```

```

A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithm by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system.

A result of the 30 kpps attack on the physical system with Intel(R) Xeon(R) D-1587@1.70GHz CPUs and 32 cores in total may look like a complete saturation of a core:

```
top - 08:59:45 up  1:34,  2 users,  load average: 0.39, 0.15, 0.08
%Cpu9  :  0.0 us,  0.0 sy,  0.0 ni,  0.0 id,  0.0 wa,  0.0 hi,100.0 si,  0.0 st
  PID USER      PR  NI    VIRT    RES    SHR S  %CPU %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND
   54 root      20   0       0      0      0 R  99.7  0.0   0:47.53 ksoftirqd/9

```

An attack from a single IP host may saturate more than 1 CPU core by forging packets to be sent from different IP addresses. The Linux kernel uses complex algorithm to schedule such IP fragment reassembly among the CPU cores. So such reassembly could be distributed to the different CPU cores, but it is quite harder to achieve this compared to the SegmentSmack flaw. Such an attack from 2 forged IP addresses may look like a complete saturation of 2 cores, but it is harder for an attacker to achieve this:

```
top - 10:10:36 up 34 min,  2 users,  load average: 0.51, 0.29, 0.15
%Cpu3  :  0.0 us,  0.0 sy,  0.0 ni,  0.0 id,  0.0 wa,  0.0 hi,100.0 si,  0.0 st

```
## Affected Products

SegmentSmack and FragmentSmack attacks are possible due to the algorithms used in the Linux kernel network stack; all the Red Hat products with moderately new Linux kernel versions are affected.

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 for Real Time
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 for ARM64
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 for IBM Power9
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 for IBM SystemZ
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host
* Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2
* Red Hat Virtualization 4

RHEL-5 is affected by these flaws by a significantly lesser degree. Namely, in our tests only a high-speed attack of 1Mpps (packets, not bytes or bits) was able to barely saturate 1 CPU core. As such, the flaws severity for RHEL5 is considered Moderate.

## Resolution

### SegmentSmack

No effective workaround or mitigation besides a fixed kernel is known at this time. Red Hat is tracking fixes via [Bugzilla ticket 1601704](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1601704 "CVE-2018-5390 kernel: TCP segments with random offsets allow a remote denial of service (SegmentSmack)"). Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel updates will be released as they become available.

### Mitigation

Except installing a fixed kernel, one may try to change the default 4MB and 3MB values of `net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh` and `net.ipv4.ipfrag_low_thresh` (and their IPv6 counterparts `net.ipv6.ipfrag_high_thresh` and `net.ipv6.ipfrag_low_thresh`) sysctl parameters to 256 kB and 192 kB (respectively) or below. The result is from some to significant CPU saturation drop during an attack, depending on a hardware and environment. For example, this mitigation applied to the 32-cores system mentioned above made a high-speed attack (~500 kpps) not noticeable.

There can be some impact on performance though, due to `ipfrag_high_thresh` being set to 262144 bytes, as this way only two 64K fragments can fit in the reassembly queue at the same time. For example, there is a risk of breaking applications that rely on large UDP packets.

The following simple script can be used to quickly change to/from the default and lower settings:

```
#!/bin/sh
if [ "x$1" == "xlow" ]; then
    echo Settinig limits low:
    sysctl -w net.ipv4.ipfrag_low_thresh=196608
    sysctl -w net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh=262144
    sysctl -w net.ipv6.ip6frag_low_thresh=196608
    sysctl -w net.ipv6.ip6frag_high_thresh=262144
    echo
elif [ "x$1" == "xdef" ]; then
    echo Settinig limits default:
    sysctl -w net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh=4194304
    sysctl -w net.ipv4.ipfrag_low_thresh=3145728
    sysctl -w net.ipv6.ip6frag_high_thresh=4194304
    sysctl -w net.ipv6.ip6frag_low_thresh=3145728
    echo
fi
echo Current values:
sysctl net.ipv4.ipfrag_low_thresh
sysctl net.ipv4.ipfrag_high_thresh
sysctl net.ipv6.ip6frag_low_thresh
sysctl net.ipv6.ip6frag_high_thresh

```

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 17.10

* [linux-image-4.13.0-1016-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2)
  -
  [4.13.0-1016.17](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.13.0-1016.17)
* [linux-image-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2)
  -
  [4.13.0.1016.14](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-raspi2/4.13.0-1016.17)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
