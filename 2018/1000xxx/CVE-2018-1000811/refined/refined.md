Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient restrictions on file uploads within the Bludit Pages Editor. Specifically, it allows users with the "Editor" role to upload arbitrary files, including PHP files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to upload files of any type, bypassing intended limitations.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The system does not properly validate the type of file being uploaded, allowing for malicious file extensions like PHP.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can upload a PHP file containing malicious code. When accessed, this code executes on the server, enabling the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the server.
- **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to a full compromise of the affected server, allowing the attacker to manipulate data, install further malware, and potentially pivot to other systems.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/admin/ajax/upload-files` endpoint.
- **Multipart Form Data:** The request uses multipart/form-data to upload the malicious file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Editor Role Access:** The attacker needs to have an account with at least an "Editor" role in Bludit.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Bludit installation.
- **Understanding of the Upload Mechanism:** The attacker needs to know the correct endpoint and request format to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- **Exploit Code:** The provided exploit code demonstrates how to upload a PHP file. The file includes a simple PHP code (`<?php system($_GET["cmd"]);?>`) to execute system commands passed via a GET request parameter, highlighting the severity of the issue.
- **Affected version:** Bludit version 3.0.0 is confirmed to be vulnerable.
