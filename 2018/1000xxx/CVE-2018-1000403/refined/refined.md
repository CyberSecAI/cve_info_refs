### CVE-2018-1000403
```text
Description: AWS CodeDeploy Plugin stored the AWS Secret Key in its configuration unencrypted in jobs' config.xml files and its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller.
This key could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission, or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

While masked from view using a password form field, the AWS Secret Key was transferred in plain text to users when accessing the job configuration form.

AWS CodeDeploy Plugin 1.20 and newer stores the AWS Secret Key encrypted in the configuration files on disk and no longer transfers it to users viewing the configuration form in plain text.
Existing jobs need to have their configuration saved for existing plain text secret keys to be overwritten.
```

- **Root cause:** The AWS Secret Key was stored unencrypted in the `config.xml` files and the global configuration file.
- **Vulnerability:** Storing sensitive information (AWS Secret Key) in plain text. Transferring the key in plain text when accessing the job configuration form, even if masked.
- **Impact:** Exposure of the AWS Secret Key to unauthorized users.
- **Attack vector:**
  - Users with "Extended Read" permission could view the key.
  - Anyone with access to the Jenkins controller file system could view the key.
  - The key was transferred in plain text to users when accessing the job configuration form.
- **Affected plugin version:** AWS CodeDeploy Plugin up to and including 1.19
- **Fixed plugin version:** AWS CodeDeploy Plugin 1.20 and newer
