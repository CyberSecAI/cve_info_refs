Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000997:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a path traversal vulnerability within Stapler, a library used by Jenkins.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Path Traversal: The vulnerability allows an attacker to access internal data of routable objects. This occurs because Stapler does not properly validate paths, allowing an attacker to specify a path to internal objects that should not be accessible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: Attackers can view the string representation of routable objects, which can expose sensitive internal data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- Crafted URL: The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting specific URLs to traverse paths and access internal objects.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated user:  A user with at least minimal privileges (Job/Configure permission) is required to exploit the vulnerability.
