```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Job Config History Plugin did not escape some query parameters shown on its pages.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the affected page, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or information disclosure when a user views the page.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered by crafting malicious query parameters in the URL that are then reflected on the page.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to craft a URL with malicious query parameters and trick a user into accessing it. The attacker does not need prior authentication to the Jenkins system to exploit the vulnerability.
