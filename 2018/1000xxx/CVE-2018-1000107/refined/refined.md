Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-1000107:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Job and Node ownership plugin did not enforce proper permission checks when updating job or node configurations using the CLI or remote API. Specifically, it allowed changes to ownership metadata without requiring the appropriate `ManageOwnership` permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The primary vulnerability was the lack of proper permission checks before allowing changes to job and node ownership metadata.
*   **Missing Authorization:** The plugin failed to verify if users had the `ManageOwnership/Jobs` or `ManageOwnership/Nodes` permissions before permitting modifications to ownership data via CLI or remote API calls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Modification of Ownership Metadata:** Attackers with `Job/Configure` permission could change job ownership metadata. Similarly, attackers with `Computer/Configure` permission could modify node ownership metadata.
*   **Potential for Data Manipulation:** While the direct impact is on ownership metadata, this could lead to further manipulation depending on how the ownership data is used by other parts of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CLI (Command Line Interface):** Attackers could use the Jenkins CLI to update job/node configurations and modify ownership metadata without proper authorization.
*   **Remote API (POST config.xml):** Attackers could use the remote API by sending `POST config.xml` requests to change job/node configurations and, consequently, modify ownership metadata.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** Attackers needed only `Job/Configure` permission (for jobs) or `Computer/Configure` permission (for nodes), which are lower than the required `ManageOwnership` permissions.
*   **Network Access:** Attackers would need to be able to access the Jenkins server through the CLI or the remote API, which is typically done through the network.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in version 0.12.0 of the Job and Node ownership plugin.
*   The fix implemented permission checks, requiring `ManageOwnership/Jobs` or `ManageOwnership/Nodes` permissions for changes via the remote API, and `Overall/Administer` permission for changes via CLI.
*   This vulnerability is also identified as SECURITY-498 in the Jenkins Security Advisory.
