  "CVE-2018-1000878": {
    "description": "Libarchive's RAR decoder has a use-after-free vulnerability. When a file in a single file archive reports that it is split across multiple volumes, the ppmd7 decoder can read and write to previously freed memory. This is caused by ppmd7 operations calling rar_br_fillup, which invokes rar_read_ahead, which can invoke archive_read_format_rar_read_header, which frees the ppmd7 buffer before the decoder is done with it.",
    "root_cause": "Improper handling of multi-volume RAR archives leading to premature freeing of the ppmd7 buffer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-After-Free"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (application crash), potential for arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "Specially crafted RAR archive file.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Ability to create a malformed RAR archive, and make a victim open it."
