- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `_sk_` value, intended to serve as a CSRF token, is not validated on the server during admin profile updates.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. The lack of server-side validation of the CSRF token allows attackers to craft malicious requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Full admin account takeover is possible. An attacker can change the administrator's password.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to lure an administrator into opening a webpage controlled by them (e.g. via a malicious link or webpage).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious webpage and trick the victim into visiting it while logged in as an administrator on the vulnerable CMS Made Simple instance.
