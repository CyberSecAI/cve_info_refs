Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000639:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an insecurely configured XML parser in LatexDraw's SVG import functionality. Specifically, the XML parser does not disable the processing of external entities, leading to an XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XXE Vulnerability:** The core vulnerability is the presence of an XXE vulnerability. The application parses SVG files, which are XML-based, and processes external entity references within the XML without proper sanitization or restriction.
- **Insecure XML Parser Configuration:** The `javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder` is used without disabling external entity resolution using `setEntityResolver`, making it vulnerable to XXE.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:
- **Disclosure of Confidential Data:**  By referencing external entities pointing to local files, attackers can potentially read sensitive information from the server's file system.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By referencing large or malformed external resources, an attacker can cause the server to crash or become unresponsive.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application can be made to send requests to other internal or external servers.
- **Port Scanning:** Attackers can use the application to perform port scans on internal networks, gaining insight into the network's structure.
- Other System Impacts:  The XXE vulnerability can lead to various other system impacts, potentially compromising the machine where the parser is located.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious SVG File:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious SVG file containing references to external entities. This file can then be provided to a user to open or import using the vulnerable LatexDraw application.
- **User Coercion:** An attacker would need to coerce a user into opening the malicious SVG file using LatexDraw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to create malicious SVG files:** Attackers need the ability to craft XML documents that contain external entity references.
- **Social engineering or other method to deliver the file:** The attacker needs to deliver the malicious file to a user of the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `net.sf.latexdraw.parsers.svg.SVGDocument.java` file, specifically lines 87-90.
- The provided exploit example demonstrates how an attacker could point an entity to a URL.
