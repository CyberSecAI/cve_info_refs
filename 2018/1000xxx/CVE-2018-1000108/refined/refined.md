Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000108:

**CVE-2018-1000108**

*   **Root Cause:** The CppNCSS Plugin failed to properly escape the report name and graph name.
*   **Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the report and graph names. When a user views the report, the injected script would execute within the user's browser session, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, or perform other actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker would need to inject malicious JavaScript into the report name or graph name that is processed by the CppNCSS plugin and then trick a user into viewing the report containing the crafted data, which would execute the malicious JavaScript.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the report name or graph name field, which might be done through a build process or through other means. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to trigger the vulnerability, but they need a target to access the report in order to trigger XSS.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in CppNCSS Plugin versions 1.1 and earlier.
*   The fix was included in version 1.2 of the plugin, which properly escapes the report name and graph name.
* The provided information includes a link to the security advisory and also includes a link to the plugin page, and a link to the changelog where the fix is mentioned.
