Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000606:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The URLTrigger Plugin's form validation method lacked permission checks, allowing unauthenticated users with Overall/Read access to trigger GET requests to arbitrary URLs. Additionally, the method did not require POST requests, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Missing permission checks:** The plugin failed to verify if the user had the necessary permissions to access the form validation method.
*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The form validation method did not require POST requests, which allowed attackers to craft malicious links or web pages that, when accessed by an authenticated user, would trigger unwanted actions.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The vulnerability allows users with Overall/Read access to make the Jenkins server send GET requests to arbitrary URLs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to:
*   Cause the Jenkins server to make GET requests to any specified URL, potentially exposing internal services or resources.
*   Potentially conduct port scans and gather information on the network behind Jenkins.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **User interaction (CSRF):** While not directly required, a user interaction is needed to trigger the CSRF vulnerability, usually through a malicious link or web page.
*   **Authentication:** An attacker needs to have at least Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance, although no specific authentication is needed to exploit the form validation methods.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to have Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Jenkins server (network access).
*   For CSRF exploitation, the attacker needs to trick a user with Overall/Read access into clicking a link or visiting a malicious webpage.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability is implemented by preventing the form validation method from connecting to user-provided URLs.
