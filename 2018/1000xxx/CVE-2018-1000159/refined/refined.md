The provided content is related to CVE-2018-1000159.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An off-by-one error in the MAC (Message Authentication Code) checking logic within the `ct_check_cbc_mac_and_pad()` function in `tlslite/utils/constanttime.py`. Specifically, when the padding is minimal (a single byte), the MAC is not checked.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper validation of the integrity check value (CWE-354).
-  The vulnerability lies in the way the code calculates the end position for checking the MAC, leading to the MAC check being skipped for minimal padding.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can manipulate the TLS ciphertext without it being detected by the receiving `tlslite-ng` instance.
- Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to inject malicious data into the communication stream, as the integrity check is bypassed.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on a network connection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the client and server to perform a MITM attack.
- No special privileges are required, and the attack doesn't require user interaction.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in `tlslite-ng` versions prior to 0.7.4, specifically introduced after commit `d7b288316bca7bcdd082e6ccff5491e241305233`.
- The fix was introduced via commit `3674815d1b0f7484454995e2737a352e0a6a93d8`.
- The vulnerability is rated as high severity with a CVSS v4 base score of 8.2.
