  "CVE-2018-1000122": {
    "description": "The curl security advisory indicates that when handling RTSP URLs, the curl library could calculate an incorrect data length when copying data, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read. This could lead to information leakage or a denial-of-service condition.",
    "affected_components": [
      "curl library",
        "httpd24-curl"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The `Curl_http_readwrite_headers()` function used to parse RTSP headers could calculate an incorrect buffer size, leading to the copying of data beyond the allocated heap buffer.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap-based buffer over-read"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could cause a denial-of-service (crash) or potentially leak sensitive information from the memory by providing crafted RTSP responses.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is remote, where a malicious RTSP server sends a crafted response to a client that uses the vulnerable curl library.",
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the RTSP server to send a crafted response.",
