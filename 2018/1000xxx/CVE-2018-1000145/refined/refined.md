Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2018-1000145:

**CVE-2018-1000145 Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The Perforce Plugin used a weak encryption method (DES) with a hardcoded key embedded in the plugin's public source code for storing credentials.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insecure Credential Storage:** The plugin's credential "encryption" was essentially just obfuscation due to the publicly available key.
    *   **Exposure via File System Access:** Users with local file system access to the Jenkins controller could easily decrypt the stored credentials.
    *   **Exposure via Jenkins Admin:** Jenkins administrators, due to their elevated access and potential vulnerabilities in their environments (browser extensions, XSS, etc.), were also at risk of exposing these credentials.
    *   **Exposure to users with Job/Extended Read Permission:** Users with this permission were able to obtain the obfuscated credentials from job configurations, because the "encryption" is not considered a secret by Jenkins.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers could obtain Perforce credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to Perforce repositories and associated resources.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Local File System Access:** Direct access to the Jenkins controller's file system
    *   **Compromised Jenkins Administrator Accounts:** Exploiting vulnerabilities or compromised accounts with admin rights on Jenkins.
    *  **Access to job configuration:** Accessing job configurations with "Job/Extended Read" permission.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Users with local Jenkins controller file system access.
    *   Jenkins Administrators or users with compromised admin accounts.
    *   Users with "Job/Extended Read" permission.

**Additional Information:**

*   The Perforce plugin has been removed from publication at the request of its former maintainers.
*   The advisory recommends using the P4 Plugin as a replacement.
*   The advisory states there is no fix for this vulnerability in the Perforce Plugin.
