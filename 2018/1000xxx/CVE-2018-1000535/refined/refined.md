Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from unsanitized user input being directly used in the file path passed to the `fopen` function within the `dbview.php` module of the LMS application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Disclosure (LFD):** The primary vulnerability is that an attacker can read arbitrary files on the server.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to properly sanitize the `$_GET['db']` parameter, which allows an attacker to manipulate the file path.
*   **Null Byte Injection:** The vulnerability can be exploited because the code appends `.sql` to the user-controlled input. An attacker can bypass this by using a null byte terminator (`%00`) in the file path, which effectively truncates the filename before the `.sql` is appended in some versions of PHP.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read the contents of any file on the server that the web application user has permission to access. This could include configuration files, database credentials, source code, or other sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a malicious GET request with the `db` parameter.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be triggered by an unauthenticated user

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable LMS application.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any credentials to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `modules/dbview.php`.
*   The user-controlled input comes from the `$_GET['db']` parameter.
*   The vulnerable file path construction is:
    ```php
    $filename = ConfigHelper::getConfig('directories.backup_dir').'/lms-'.$_GET['db'].'.sql';
    ```
*   The `fopen` function is then used to read the file specified by `$filename`:
    ```php
    $handle = fopen($filename, 'rb');
    ```
*   The use of `readfile_chunked` with `fopen` exposes the file content if the `fopen` operation is successful.

**CVE Specific Information:**
* The provided text includes the CVE ID `CVE-2018-1000535` and states that the vulnerability is related to Local File Disclosure.
