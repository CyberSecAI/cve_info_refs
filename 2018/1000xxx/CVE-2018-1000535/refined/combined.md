# The Issue

An attacker can arbitrarily read files (which the user running the web application has permission to read) using unsanitised user input passed to the `fopen` PHP function

# Where the Issue Occurred

An attacker can control the file path for reading a file using the variable assignment below:

<https://github.com/lmsgit/lms/blob/1dddbab05fcbedcd4ec02ba8e1d1aa3bc384d202/modules/dbview.php#L49>

The above variable is passed to the line below, where the `fopen` function is being used to read the file:

<https://github.com/lmsgit/lms/blob/1dddbab05fcbedcd4ec02ba8e1d1aa3bc384d202/modules/dbview.php#L32>

As displayed above, `.sql` is appended to the file name, however this can be bypassed (in some versions of PHP) using a null byte terminator (%00)

# LMS Local File Disclosure

June 1, 2018 · Sajeeb Lohani · CVE-2018-1000535

## The Issue

A Local File Disclosure (LFD) vulnerability allows an attacker to disclose the contents of files on the target system, provided the victim user has read permissions to the specified file.

0dd identified that the LMS project contained a Local File Disclosure vulnerability, which could be triggered by an unauthenticated user, via a GET variable (`$_GET['db']`)

## Where the Issue Occurred

The code below displays that an attacker can control the path within the `$filename` variable (found in `/modules/dbview.php`):

```
$filename = ConfigHelper::getConfig('directories.backup_dir').'/lms-'.$_GET['db'].'.sql';

```

The `$filename` variable is then passed to the `readfile_chunked` function which performs a read function using `fopen` and prints out the contents of the file:

```
$handle = fopen($filename, 'rb');
if ($handle === false)
    return false;
while (!feof($handle))
{
    $buffer = fread($handle, $chunksize);
    echo $buffer;
    flush();
    if ($retbytes)
        $cnt += strlen($buffer);
}

```

As displayed above, `.sql` is appended to the file name, however this can be bypassed (in some versions of PHP) using a null byte terminator (%00), allowing an attacker to gain access to files within the file system.
