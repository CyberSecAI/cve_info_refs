Consequence: If these values were added using an answer file, they appeared in the log file as clear-text. Fix: Now 'hosted-engine --deploy' adds these items before it starts writing the log file. Result: All occurrences of the secret values are filtered in the log file. Additional information: These values are not included in answer files automatically created by 'hosted-engine --deploy'. They are included in answer files created by the cockpit plugin which provides a GUI to 'hosted-engine --deploy', since 4.2. In 4.1 they were not included. Users could still manually add them also before, although that's not documented. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2018-02-12 11:53:22 UTC | | | oVirt Team: | Integration | | | Embargoed: |  | | | [Dependent Products:](page.cgi?id=fields.html#dependent_products "Other Products that are affected by this bug.") | Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager | | Flags: | rule-engine: ovirt-4.2+ | |
