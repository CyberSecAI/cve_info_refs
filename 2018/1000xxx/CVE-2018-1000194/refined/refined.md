Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-1000194:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A path traversal vulnerability existed in the agent to controller security subsystem within Jenkins.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The agent to controller security subsystem, designed to protect the Jenkins controller from malicious agents, did not properly normalize paths before access checks. This allowed agents to bypass whitelisted directories.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Malicious agents could read and write files on the Jenkins controller that they should not have access to.

**Attack vectors:**
- A maliciously configured agent could exploit the path traversal vulnerability by sending crafted paths to the Jenkins controller.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to have the ability to configure a Jenkins agent. This means they would need to have at least "Overall/Read" permissions to connect an agent to the Jenkins controller.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix involved normalizing paths before performing access checks.
- The vulnerability has a high severity rating.
