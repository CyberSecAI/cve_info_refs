Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from how `aiohttp-session`'s `RedisStorage` handles session invalidation. When a session is invalidated (e.g., user logs out), the session data in Redis is emptied, but the session ID (key) remains. Subsequently, the `load_session` function only checks if the key exists or not. Due to the key still existing after invalidation, `load_session` retrieves the empty session data and returns a session object with the previously used ID instead of creating a new one.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Session Fixation:** The primary vulnerability is a session fixation flaw. The application reuses the same session ID, even after a logout, making it possible to inject a cookie with that ID into another user's browser and potentially gain access to their account if the user logs in with the injected cookie.
- **Inconsistent Session Handling:** The `RedisStorage` logic doesn't distinguish between a truly non-existent session ID and an invalidated session with an existing ID but empty data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can hijack a user's session. After obtaining a valid session cookie, the attacker can invalidate it, then trick another user into using this invalidated session ID. When the victim logs in, the web application associates that session with the victim, effectively giving the attacker access to the victim's account because the attacker possesses the hijacked session ID.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Cookie Injection:** The attacker needs to inject a previously valid, then invalidated session cookie into the victim's browser. This can be achieved through methods described in OWASP's documentation on session fixation (e.g., through social engineering, network interception, or other techniques).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **Access to a valid session:** The attacker must first obtain a valid session cookie from the target application.
2.  **Ability to invalidate the session:** The attacker must be able to trigger a logout or some method to invalidate the session.
3.  **Cookie Injection Capability:** The attacker needs a way to inject the invalidated session cookie into the victim's browser.
4.  **User interaction:** The victim must subsequently use the web app with the injected cookie.
5. **Knowledge of the session ID**: The attacker must know the session ID that was previously in use.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided code snippets from `redis_storage.py` confirm the described logic. Specifically, `load_session` checks for `None` from Redis, not an empty value. The `save_session` function clears the session data by saving an empty mapping to the session key in Redis when a session is cleared.
- The issue report on Github provides a clear explanation of the vulnerability, which is that the key for the session is not removed from redis when the session is cleared, but is just emptied. This causes the `load_session` to return the session with the invalidated id.
