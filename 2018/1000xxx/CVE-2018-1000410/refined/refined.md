- **Root cause of vulnerability**: When Jenkins fails to process form submissions due to an internal error, the error message shown to the user and written to the log typically includes the serialized JSON form submission.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Sensitive data exposure in error messages and logs. Specifically, secrets, such as submitted passwords, could be included in the JSON object, leading to their exposure in plain text in the UI and logs.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Disclosure of sensitive information such as passwords.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can trigger an internal error during form submission to potentially expose secrets.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No specific attacker capabilities or position mentioned, but the attacker needs to be able to trigger the failure of form submission processing.
