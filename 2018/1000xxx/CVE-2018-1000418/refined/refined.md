Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000418:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The HipChat Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method that sends test notifications. Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing permission checks:** The plugin's test notification functionality lacked proper permission checks.
*   **CSRF vulnerability:** The form validation method was vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks because it did not require POST requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Credential Capture:** Attackers with Overall/Read access could connect to an attacker-specified HipChat server using attacker-specified connection settings and credentials IDs obtained through other means, potentially capturing sensitive credentials stored in Jenkins.
*   **Message Sending:** Attackers could submit messages to HipChat using the compromised credentials and connection settings.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Jenkins instance.
*   **Web UI:** The attacker exploits the vulnerable form validation method through the Jenkins web UI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Overall/Read access:** The attacker needs to have at least Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
*   **Knowledge of credential IDs:** The attacker needs to obtain credential IDs through other means, possibly by exploiting CVE-2018-1000419.
*  **CSRF exploitation:** The attacker needs to induce a victim to make a request to the vulnerable form validation endpoint (this can be done via a malicious webpage).
*   **HipChat Server:** The attacker needs to control a HipChat server or have a HipChat server where the attacker wants to send the message.

**Additional Details (from the provided content):**
* This vulnerability is specifically addressed in the HipChat Plugin version 2.2.1.
*  The security advisory also mentions a related vulnerability (CVE-2018-1000419) in the same plugin, which allows unprivileged users with Overall/Read access to enumerate credential IDs, which could be used to further exploit this vulnerability.
* The advisory indicates that the fix for this issue includes requiring POST requests for the form validation method and enforcing Overall/Administer permissions.

In summary, CVE-2018-1000418 details a vulnerability in the Jenkins HipChat Plugin where missing permission checks and a CSRF vulnerability could be exploited by attackers with Overall/Read access to capture credentials and send messages to HipChat.
