# Changelog

## Version 2.2.1 (Sep 25, 2018)

* Fix security issues:
  [one](https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2018-09-25/#SECURITY-984%20(1)),
  [two](https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2018-09-25/#SECURITY-984%20(2))

## Version 2.2.0 (Aug 20, 2018)

The plugin documentation has been updated and improved in general.

New Features:

* BUILD\_DESCRIPTION macro is now supported (#88)
* Support custom card icons per notifications (#101)

Bugfixes:

* First successful build should always result in SUCCESS notifications
  (#105)
* Handle missing macro implementations more gracefully (#106, #108)
* Straighten out Jenkins version dependency (#102)
* Ensure configuration is only migrated during plugin upgrade
  (JENKINS-44790)

## Version 2.1.1 (Feb 15, 2017)

Bugfixes:

* BUILD\_DURATION in pipeline builds always displayed "0 ms"
  (JENKINS-41861)
* The HipChat cards should use HTTPS to display the Jenkins logo
  (#94) - Note: the cards only work when v2 API is enabled.
* HIPCHAT\_CHANGES\_OR\_CAUSE and COMMIT\_MESSAGE variables weren't
  working at all in pipeline builds (JENKINS-41861)

## Version 2.1.0 (Feb 7, 2017)

* The $PRINT\_FULL\_ENV variable is no longer supported.
* Several tokens that were possible to use in previous versions, are
  now deprecated and eventually will not be supported. To remain
  backwards compatible, the plugin still supports all the old tokens,
  but their replacement to the new tokens are recommended

  | Deprecated token | Supported replacement |
  | --- | --- |
  | $DURATION | $BUILD\_DURATION |
  | $JOB\_DISPLAY\_NAME | $PROJECT\_DISPLAY\_NAME |
  | $TEST\_COUNT | ${TEST\_COUNTS,var=\"total\"} |
  | $FAILED\_TEST\_COUNT | ${TEST\_COUNTS,var=\"fail\"} |
  | $SKIPPED\_TEST\_COUNT | ${TEST\_COUNTS,var=\"skip\"} |
  | $SUCCESS\_TEST\_COUNT | ${TEST\_COUNTS,var=\"pass\"} |
  | $URL | $BUILD\_URL |
  | $COMMIT\_MESSAGE\_TEXT | ${COMMIT\_MESSAGE,escape=false} |
  | $CHANGES | $HIPCHAT\_CHANGES |
  | $CHANGES\_OR\_CAUSE | $HIPCHAT\_CHANGES\_OR\_CAUSE |

New Features:

* Very long notification messages caused HTTP 400 errors (#87)
* Need ability to turn off blue ocean URLs (#92) ->
  $BLUE\_OCEAN\_URL has been introduced to represent these URLs
  instead. $URL/$BUILD\_URL now always results in classic UI links
* BUILD\_DURATION token renders "and counting" messages in pipeline
  jobs (JENKINS-40461)

## **Version 2.0.0 (Oct 27, 2016)**

The plugin now requires JDK 7 runtime.

New Features:

* Blue Ocean UI support - the HipChat plugin should now generate URLs
  that are compatible with Blue Ocean (#82)

  HTML format) and $COMMIT\_MESSAGE\_TEXT (when using text format)
  variables have been added
* Display "No changes" if no SCM change happened between builds

  Credential API. Existing keys will be migrated across to the new
  format as part of Jenkins upgrade (JENKINS-27303)
* Expose $SUCCESS\_TEST\_COUNT and $SKIPPED\_TEST\_COUNT as message
  template variables

Bugfixes:

* Fix incorrect link for help text (#76)
* Small updates to logging statement to make the plugin a bit less

    JENKINS-28314, JENKINS-26974, #16, #54)
  + introduce default notifications (can be set under Global
    settings), which are only triggered if a job has no
    notifications set up (#30)
  + configuration stored in old format will keep on working
* Expose failed and total test count in message templates, use
  $FAILED\_TEST\_COUNT and $TEST\_COUNT respectively (#18)

[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`argus-notifier`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/argus-notifier)**

**Description:**

Argus Notifier Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow administrators configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
Those could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in this plugin now requires Overall/Administer permission.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Chatter Notifier Plugin allowed capturing credentials

**SECURITY-1050 (1)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`chatter-notifier`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/chatter-notifier)**

**Description:**

Chatter Notifier Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

This form validation method now require POST requests and Item/Configure permission on the job being configured.

### Unprivileged users with Overall/Read access are able to enumerate credential IDs in Chatter Notifier Plugin

**SECURITY-1050 (2)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`chatter-notifier`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/chatter-notifier)**

**Description:**

Chatter Notifier Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin’s functionality to select the one to use.

This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
Those could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in this plugin now requires Item/Configure permission for the job being configured.

### Dimensions Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1065**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`dimensionsscm`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/dimensionsscm)**

**Description:**

Dimensions Plugin stored a password unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller.
This password could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

The plugin now stores the password encrypted in the configuration files on disk and no longer transfers it to users viewing the configuration form in plain text.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Dimensions Plugin

**SECURITY-1108**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`dimensionsscm`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/dimensionsscm)**

**Description:**

Users with Overall/Read permission were able to access Dimensions Plugin’s form validation URL, having it connect to an attacker-specified Dimensions system with attacker-specified credentials.

Additionally, this form validation URL did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

The form validation now performs a permission check and requires POST requests to be sent.

### Publish Over Dropbox Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-845**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`publish-over-dropbox`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/publish-over-dropbox)**

**Description:**

Publish Over Dropbox Plugin stored authorization code and access code unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller.
These secrets could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Additionally, the authorization code was not masked from view using a password form field.

The plugin now stores these secrets encrypted in the configuration files on disk and no longer transfers the authorization code to users viewing the configuration form in plain text.

### XML External Entity Processing Vulnerability in Monitoring Plugin

**SECURITY-1156
/
CVE-2018-15531**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[high](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`monitoring`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/monitoring)**

**Description:**

The JavaMelody library bundled in Monitoring Plugin is affected by an XML External Entity (XXE) processing vulnerability.

This allows attacker to send crafted requests to a web application for extraction of secrets from the file system, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

Monitoring plugin 1.74 updates its JavaMelody dependency to fix the issue.

The Jenkins security team and the maintainer of Monitoring Plugin have been unable to reproduce the issue in Jenkins, but we still recommend updating.
