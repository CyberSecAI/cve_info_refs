Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000423:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The Crowd 2 Integration Plugin stored the Crowd password in plain text within its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller's file system.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Insecure Storage of Credentials:** The plugin failed to encrypt the Crowd password before storing it. This is a critical security flaw as it exposes the password to anyone with access to the Jenkins controller's file system.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker with access to the Jenkins controller's file system could read the plain text Crowd password and potentially gain unauthorized access to the Crowd service.

**Attack vectors:**

- **File System Access:** The attacker needs access to the Jenkins controller's file system to read the configuration file. This could be achieved through various means such as gaining shell access or exploiting other vulnerabilities in the Jenkins system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have at least low-level access to the Jenkins controller file system.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was addressed by encrypting the password before storing it in the configuration file. The fix also ensures the password is not transferred in plain text to users viewing the configuration form.
- The severity of this vulnerability is rated as low.
