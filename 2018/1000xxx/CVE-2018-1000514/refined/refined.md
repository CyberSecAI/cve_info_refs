The provided content relates to CVE-2018-1000514.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of CSRF protection in the `delete` action of the `homepagesettings` controller.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). There was no CSRF token protection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could trick an administrator into deleting a box by crafting a malicious link or embedding a form on a website.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a crafted URL or form that, when accessed by an authenticated administrator, will cause the deletion of the specified box via CSRF. The vulnerable URL is of the form `/limesurvey/index.php/admin/homepagesettings/sa/delete/id/ID`, where `ID` is the identifier of the box to delete.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send a link or embed a form into a website that an authenticated administrator would access.
The attacker does not need direct access to the LimeSurvey instance.
