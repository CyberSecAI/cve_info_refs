Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-1000828:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure parsing of XML input within the `UpdateMessageReader.java` file in Frostwire. The application uses an XML parser that is not configured to disable external entities. This allows an attacker to inject malicious XML that references external entities, leading to an XXE vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The core weakness is the application's failure to disable external entity processing in the XML parser. This allows the attacker to control the XML document's processing and reference external entities.
- **Insecure XML Parsing:** The `XMLReader` is used to parse XML without securely disabling entities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to:
    - Disclosure of confidential data
    - Denial of service
    - Server-side request forgery (SSRF)
    - Port scanning from the perspective of the machine where the parser is located
    - Other system impacts, as stated in the content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack:** An attacker can intercept the HTTP call to the update URL (`http://update.frostwire.com`) and inject malicious XML content. This is possible because the application fetches update messages from this URL.
- The attacker modifies the XML response of the update server to include an external entity reference.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Interception:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the Frostwire client and the update server (MitM).
- **XML Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to craft malicious XML payloads with external entity references.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerable code is located in `UpdateMessageReader.java`, specifically at line 306 where the `rdr.parse(src)` method is called.
- The default update URL, `http://update.frostwire.com`, can be targeted for the MitM attack, this URL is found in the code at line 43
- The content suggests that the issue was reported on September 29, 2018, and a blog post about it was published on October 28, 2018.
