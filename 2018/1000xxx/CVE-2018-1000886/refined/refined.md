```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is caused by a crafted file that triggers an infinite macro recursion, leading to a stack overflow.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
The NASM assembler fails to properly handle a specific type of malformed input file, causing a stack overflow due to uncontrolled macro expansion. This is due to a lack of proper checks on macro recursion depth.

Impact of exploitation:
A successful exploit will cause a stack overflow, resulting in a crash of the NASM assembler. In a controlled environment, this can be used for denial of service.

Attack vectors:
The attack vector is a specially crafted assembly file that, when processed by NASM, triggers the excessive macro expansion.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted assembly file to the NASM assembler.
