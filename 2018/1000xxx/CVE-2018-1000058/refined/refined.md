- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incomplete sandbox protection for Java deserialization methods (`readResolve`) within Pipeline scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `readResolve` methods, which are related to Java deserialization, were not subject to the sandbox restrictions applied to other parts of the Pipeline scripts. This allowed for the execution of arbitrary code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation could occur by a user with the permission to configure Pipelines in Jenkins or by a trusted committer to repositories containing Jenkinsfiles, by creating a malicious script containing malicious serialized Java objects.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have permissions to configure pipelines or be a trusted committer to repositories containing Jenkinsfiles.
