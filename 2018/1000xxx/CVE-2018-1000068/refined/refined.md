  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2018-1000068",
    "details": "Jenkins did not take into account case-insensitive file systems when preventing access to plugin resource files that should not be accessible. This allowed users with Overall/Read permission to download plugin resource files in `META-INF` and `WEB-INF` directories, such as the plugins' JAR files, which could contain hardcoded secrets.",
    "affected_versions": "Jenkins weekly up to and including 2.106, Jenkins LTS up to and including 2.89.3",
    "fixed_versions": "Jenkins weekly should be updated to version 2.107, Jenkins LTS should be updated to version 2.89.4",
    "root_cause": "Incomplete fix to [SECURITY-155](../2014-10-01/#SECURITY-155).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Path traversal"
