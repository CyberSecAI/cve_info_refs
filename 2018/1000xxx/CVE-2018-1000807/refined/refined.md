Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2018-1000807 and CVE-2018-1000808:

**CVE-2018-1000807**

*   **Root Cause:** Use-after-free vulnerability in X509 object handling within the Python Cryptographic Authority's pyOpenSSL library. The vulnerability occurs because the X509 objects created in the verify callback didn't properly manage memory ownership. If the calling application retained a reference to the object after the callback completed, a use-after-free condition would occur.
*   **Weakness:** CWE-416 Use After Free
*  **Impact:**  A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network-based. The vulnerability is triggered when an application using pyOpenSSL handles X509 certificates, specifically in a verification callback.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to trigger a TLS connection or any operation that causes the vulnerable application to call the verify callback with a crafted or malicious certificate.

**CVE-2018-1000808**

*   **Root Cause:** Failure to release memory before removing the last reference in the PKCS #12 store handling within the Python Cryptographic Authority's pyOpenSSL library. This vulnerability stems from the library failing to free the underlying objects when the stack was freed, leading to memory leaks upon loading certificates from PKCS #12 store with cacerts.
*   **Weakness:** CWE-401: Failure to Release Memory Before Removing Last Reference
*   **Impact:** A remote attacker could cause a denial of service by exhausting system memory.
*  **Attack Vector:** Network-based.  Exploitation depends on the calling application but could involve initiating a TLS connection that reloads certificates from a PKCS #12 store.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to trigger an action that would cause the vulnerable application to load certificates from a PKCS#12 store.

**Additional Information:**

*   Both vulnerabilities are present in pyOpenSSL versions prior to 17.5.0.
*   The fixes for both vulnerabilities were included in pyOpenSSL version 17.5.0.
*   The fixes required a minimum cryptography version of 2.1.4, which exposed the `X509_up_ref` method needed for proper memory management
*   Red Hat has classified CVE-2018-1000807 as "Moderate" impact and CVE-2018-1000808 as "Moderate" impact
*   SUSE has classified CVE-2018-1000807 as "Important" and CVE-2018-1000808 as "Moderate" impact.
*   Ubuntu has issued USN-3813-1 to address these vulnerabilities, indicating the severity was high enough to warrant a security patch.

**Summary of Fixes:**

The fixes for these vulnerabilities involved:

*  Properly releasing the memory associated with X509 objects in the verify callback, using  `X509_up_ref` to increment the reference count before creating the python object.
*  Ensuring that underlying objects within the PKCS #12 store are freed correctly and not leaked when the stack is freed.
*  Adding setuptools as a dependency to pyopenssl.

These vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to cause denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code (CVE-2018-1000807) and could result in denial of service by memory exhaustion (CVE-2018-1000808). Upgrading to pyOpenSSL 17.5.0 or later is crucial to mitigating these risks.
