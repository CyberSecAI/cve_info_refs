**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution within the Jenkins controller JVM, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the configuration of the Liquibase Runner Plugin's build step by a user with Job/Configure permission.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have Job/Configure permission within Jenkins to modify the build step of a job using the vulnerable plugin.

**Additional notes:**
- There is no fix available for this vulnerability as of the publication of the security advisory.
