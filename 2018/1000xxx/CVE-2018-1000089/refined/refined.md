Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the security vulnerability addressed by CVE-2018-1000089:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Django error reporting mechanism included the value of the `ANYMAIL_WEBHOOK_AUTHORIZATION` setting in error reports.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Exposure of sensitive information: The `ANYMAIL_WEBHOOK_AUTHORIZATION` setting, which is used as a shared secret for webhook authentication, could be exposed in Django error reports.
*   Insecure storage of secret: The shared secret was being stored in a setting that was not sanitized by Django's error reporting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized webhook access:** An attacker who gained access to the exposed shared secret could forge or manipulate Anymail tracking/inbound events.
*   **Malicious input to application:** Attackers could post fabricated or malicious events to the application, potentially leading to data manipulation, logic bypass, or other security issues.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Access to Django error reports:** The attacker needs access to Django error reports, which could be achieved if:
    *   The application is misconfigured with `DEBUG=True` in a production environment
    *   Error reports are sent through insecure channels (e.g., email without encryption).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to exposed error reports:** The attacker needs access to Django error reports to extract the exposed `WEBHOOK_AUTHORIZATION` value.
*   **Understanding of Anymail webhooks:** Knowledge on how Anymail uses webhooks to be able to send forged tracking/inbound events.

**Mitigation:**

The fix involved renaming the setting from `WEBHOOK_AUTHORIZATION` to `WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Django's error reporting mechanism sanitizes settings with `SECRET` in the name. The old `WEBHOOK_AUTHORIZATION` is still temporarily supported, issuing a system check warning. Users of the library were advised to:

*   Upgrade to the patched version.
*   Rename the `WEBHOOK_AUTHORIZATION` setting to `WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `settings.py`.
*   Rotate the shared secret, especially if there is a suspicion that error reports might have been exposed.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability only affects users that are using Anymail's event tracking and/or inbound webhooks, and have not setup webhooks.
