  "CVE-2018-1000140": {
    "description": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the relpTcpChkPeerName function within the src/tcp.c file of librelp. This vulnerability can be exploited when parsing X.509 certificates, potentially allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability arises during the verification process of X.509 certificates from a peer, where a specially crafted certificate can cause a buffer overflow, especially when connecting to rsyslog.",
    "affected_components": [
      "librelp"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the relpTcpChkPeerName function due to improper handling of X.509 certificates.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution on affected systems.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote attacker sending a specially crafted X.509 certificate via network traffic to a vulnerable service (e.g., rsyslog)."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to establish a network connection to the vulnerable service and send crafted network traffic containing a malicious X.509 certificate.",
     "additional_information": [
      "The vulnerability is located in the `src/tcp.c` file, specifically within the `relpTcpChkPeerName` function.",
       "The issue was reported by Rainer Gerhards (rsyslog) and originally discovered by Bas van Schaik and Kevin Backhouse of lgtm.com (Semmle).",
        "Red Hat strongly advises users not to expose logging RELP services to public networks."
