The provided content relates to CVE-2018-1000669.

Root cause of vulnerability:
The `paycollect.pl` script in Koha is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
The script lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to potentially execute unauthorized actions.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can potentially manipulate the payment collection process, leading to unauthorized financial transactions or data manipulation.

Attack vectors:
The attack can be performed by tricking a logged-in user into visiting a malicious website or clicking a malicious link, which sends a forged request to the vulnerable `paycollect.pl` script.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in Koha user into visiting a malicious page or clicking a link, where the malicious page contains a forged request to the vulnerable `paycollect.pl` script. The attacker does not need to be logged in, but does require a valid session id for the target user.
