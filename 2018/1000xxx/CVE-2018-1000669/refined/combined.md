Would this mean that this will not be a 0day bug and we would require to implement custom CSRF countermeasures? ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=19117#c3)  Jonathan Druart    2017-08-15 21:01:13 UTC  ``` It is a known bug (at least by me).  With my answer I wanted to tell that the vulnerability is not specific to members/paycollect.pl, several other scripts are impacted.  We first fixed the forms that had a big impacts on the patron data and security (change of password, patron's detail, permissions, deletion of a patron's entry, etc.) as well as all forms of the public interface (OPAC).  It is on my todo list, but I am not considering it as high priority for now.  > Would this mean that this will not be a 0day bug and we would require to > implement custom CSRF countermeasures?

We are not a KOHA library user. We are a pen testing company that found this vulnerability while performing a pen test for a client.  The previous question was intended to ask if the client should implement their own workaround or should they wait on a stable release from KOHA.  As this is a known issue as mentioned on your previous comment, was I the first to report this issue to KOHA? And are there any CVE numbers reserved or assigned to this issue? ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=19117#c5)  Jonathan Druart    2017-08-22 16:10:44 UTC  ``` (In reply to Jiaky Ooi from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=19117#c4)) > The previous question was intended to ask if the client should implement > their own workaround or should they wait on a stable release from KOHA.  What would be a workaround? As I told you earlier it is on my list, but I do not know when I will have time to dedicate to this issue.  > As this is a known issue as mentioned on your previous comment, was I the > first to report this issue to KOHA? And are there any CVE numbers reserved > or assigned to this issue?  There are no CVE reserved. paycollect.pl is only one of the several scripts that are vulnerable for CSRF attacks. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=19117#c6)  Jonathan Druart    2017-10-04 20:51:50 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 67616](attachment.cgi?id=67616&action=diff "Bug 19117: Add CSRF protection to paycollect.pl") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=67616&action=edit "Bug 19117: Add CSRF protection to paycollect.pl") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=19117&attachment=67616) [Bug 19117](show_bug.cgi?id=19117 "CLOSED FIXED - paycollect.pl is vulnerable for CSRF attacks"): Add CSRF protection to paycollect.pl  Security bug, trivial changes, no need to provide procedure for script kiddies.
