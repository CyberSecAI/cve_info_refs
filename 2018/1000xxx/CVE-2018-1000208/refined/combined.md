Any reason the two expressions can not be merged to `/\.*[\/|\\]+/i`? It should match both `../`, `..////` and `////`. You might also want to consider an expression such as `(?:\.*[\/|\\]+)+`. This matches `../../....//////` too.

In my opinion, all files in the specified registry topic should be removed, so I find the extensions part of this extraneous. I'm going to submit a security fix that addresses only the path traversal issue. We can discuss the extensions issue later. Regardless, the change to \_build/transport.core.php should not be in here.
