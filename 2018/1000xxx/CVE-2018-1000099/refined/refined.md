Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000099:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a crash within the PJSIP/PJProject library when processing an SDP (Session Description Protocol) message containing an invalid `fmtp` (format parameters) attribute. Specifically, the `pjmedia_sdp_attr_get_fmtp` function in `src/pjmedia/sdp.c` does not properly handle non-digit characters in the `fmtp` attribute string, leading to a segmentation fault (crash).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The code fails to validate the contents of the `fmtp` attribute, expecting only digits where other characters may be present.
- **Lack of Error Handling:** The function doesn't include appropriate error handling to gracefully manage unexpected or invalid input within the `fmtp` attribute.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can trigger a segmentation fault (crash) by sending a crafted SDP message with an invalid `fmtp` attribute, thus causing the application using the PJSIP library to become unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Attack:** Exploitation occurs via network communication through the receipt of a malicious SDP message within a SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) INVITE request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have the ability to send SIP messages to a system running vulnerable PJSIP library.
- **Crafted SDP Message:** The attacker needs to create an SDP message with a malformed `fmtp` attribute containing non-digit characters (specifically a null character `\x00`).

**Additional Information:**

- The issue was identified by Alfred Farrugia and Sandro Gauci from Enable Security and reported by Kevin Harwell from Digium.
- The vulnerability is fixed in PJSIP/PJProject version 2.5.5~dfsg-6+deb9u1 (for Debian stretch).
- The provided GDB backtrace shows the exact line of code (`src/pjmedia/sdp.c:350`) where the segmentation fault occurs, confirming the location and nature of the vulnerability.
- The fix involves addressing the improper input validation and error handling within the `pjmedia_sdp_attr_get_fmtp` function.
- Ticket #2092 and #2094 from trac.pjsip.org detail the vulnerability and its fix.
