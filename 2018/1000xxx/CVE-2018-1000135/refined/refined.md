  "CVE-2018-1000135": {
    "Description": "GNOME NetworkManager version 1.10.2 and earlier contains a Information Exposure (CWE-200) vulnerability in DNS resolver that can result in Private DNS queries leaked to local network's DNS servers, while on VPN. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in Some Ubuntu 16.04 packages were fixed, but later updates removed the fix. cf. https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1754671 an upstream fix does not appear to be available at this time.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in how NetworkManager handles DNS queries while connected to a full-tunnel VPN. It improperly prioritizes DNS servers, leading to private DNS queries being sent to local network DNS servers instead of solely to the VPN's DNS servers.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Information Exposure (CWE-200)",
       "Improper prioritization of DNS servers leading to DNS leaks",
       "Misconfiguration of DNS settings when a full-tunnel VPN is active",
       "Use of split DNS even when a full-tunnel VPN is intended"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Private DNS queries are leaked to potentially untrusted local network DNS servers, exposing sensitive information about the user's activity and potentially allowing DNS spoofing or other attacks. Additionally, it can lead to functional issues, such as inability to resolve internal resources, when internal DNS queries are routed externally, or routing external traffic internally.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker on the local network can potentially intercept and log the leaked DNS queries.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the victim. No specific capabilities are required, only the ability to sniff network traffic on the local network."
