## Descriptions

### Server-side request forgery vulnerability in Git Plugin

**SECURITY-810
/
CVE-2018-1000182**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`git`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/git)**

**Description:**

Various form validation methods in Git Plugin did not check the permission of the user accessing them, allowing anyone with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to cause Jenkins to send a GET request to a specified URL.

Additionally, these form validation methods did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

These form validation methods now require POST requests and the Overall/Administer permission.

### Server-side request forgery vulnerability in GitHub Plugin

**SECURITY-799
/
CVE-2018-1000184**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`github`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/github)**

**Description:**

A form validation method in GitHub Plugin did not check the permission of the user accessing it, allowing anyone with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to cause Jenkins to send a POST request to a specified URL.

If that request’s HTTP response code indicates success, the form validation is returning a generic success message, otherwise the HTTP status code is returned.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

The form validation method now requires POST requests and the Overall/Administer permission.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in GitHub Plugin allowed capturing credentials

* [Releases](/ghprb/releases/)
* [Issues](/ghprb/issues/)
* [Dependencies](/ghprb/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/ghprb/healthscore/)

You should probably migrate to [GitHub Branch Source
Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/GitHub%2BBranch%2BSource%2BPlugin)

This plugin builds pull requests in github and report results.

More **up to date** information is available on the:

[Github
README.md](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ghprb-plugin/blob/master/README.md)

**Commands:**

When a new pull request is opened in the project and the author of the
pull request isn't white-listed, builder will ask "Can one of the admins
verify this patch?".

* "ok to test" to accept this pull request for testing
* "test this please" for a one time test run
* "add to whitelist" to add the author to the whitelist

If the build fails for other various reasons you can rebuild.

* "retest this please" to start a new build

**Installation:**

* I recommend to create GitHub 'bot' user that will be used for
  communication with GitHub (however you can use your own account if
  you want).
* The user needs to have push rights for your repository (must be
  collaborator (user repo) or must have Push & Pull rights
  (organization repo)).
* If you want to use GitHub hooks have them set automatically the user
  needs to have administrator rights for your repository (must be
  owner (user repo) or must have Push, Pull & Administrative rights
  (organization repo))

* Install the plugin.
* Go to ``Manage Jenkins`` -> ``Configure System`` ->
  ``GitHub pull requests builder`` section.

* Add GitHub usernames of admins (these usernames will be used as
  defaults in new jobs).
* Under Advanced, you can modify:
  + The phrase for adding users to the whitelist via comment. (Java
    regexp)
  + The phrase for accepting a pull request for testing. (Java
    regexp)
  + The phrase for starting a new build. (Java regexp)
  + The crontab line. This specify default setting for new jobs.
* Under Application Setup
  + There are global and job default extensions that can be
    configured for things like:
    - Commit status updates
    - Build status messages
    - Adding lines from the build log to the build result message
    - etc.

#### Credentials

* If you are using Enterprise GitHub set the server api URL in
  ``GitHub server api URL``. Otherwise leave there
  ``[https://api.github.com](https://api.github.com/)``.
* A GitHub API token or username password can be used for access to
  the GitHub API
* To setup credentials for a given GitHub Server API URL:
  + Click Add next to the ``Credentials`` drop down
    - For a token select ``Kind`` -> ``Secret text``
      * If you haven't generated an access token you can
        generate one in ``Test Credentials...``.
        + Set your 'bot' user's GitHub username and password.
        + Press the ``Create Access Token`` button
        + Jenkins will create a token credential, and give you
          the id of the newly created credentials. The default
          description is: ``serverAPIUrl + " GitHub auto
          generated token credentials"``.
    - For username/password us ``Kind`` -> ``Username with
      password``
      * The scope determines what has access to the credentials
        you are about to create
    - The first part of the description is used to show different
      credentials in the drop down, so use something
      semi-descriptive
    - Click ``Add``
  + Credentials will automatically be created in the domain given by
    the ``GitHub Server API URL`` field.
  + Select the credentials you just created in the drop down.
  + The first fifty characters in the Description are used to
    differentiate credentials per job, so again use something
    semi-descriptive
* Add as many GitHub auth sections as you need, even duplicate server
  URLs

* Save to preserve your changes.

#### Creating job:

* Create a new job.
* Add the project's GitHub URL to the "GitHub project" field (the one
  you can enter into browser. eg: "<https://github.com/janinko/ghprb>")
* Select Git SCM.
* Add your GitHub "Repository URL".
* Under Advanced, set "refspec" to

  ```
  +refs/pull/*:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*

  ```
* In "Branch Specifier", enter

  ```
  ${sha1}

  ```

  or if you want to use the actual commit in the pull request, use

  ```
  ${ghprbActualCommit}

  ```
* Under "Build Triggers", check "Github pull requests builder".

  + Add admins for this specific job.
  + If you want to use GitHub hooks for automatic testing, read the
    help for "Use github hooks for build triggering" in job
    configuration. Then you can check the checkbox.
  + In Advanced, you can modify:
    - The crontab line for this specific job. This schedules
      polling to GitHub for new changes in Pull Requests.
    - The whitelisted users for this specific job.
    - The organisation names whose members are considered
      whitelisted for this specific job.
* Save to preserve your changes.

  Make sure you **DON'T** have "Prune remote branches before build"
  advanced option selected, since it will prune the branch created to
  test this build. As noted in issue
  [#507](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ghprb-plugin/issues/507) this
  may be achieved by unchecking 'Lightweight checkout'.

If you want to manually build the job, in the job setting check "This
build is parameterized" and add string parameter named "sha1". When
starting build give the "sha1" parameter commit id you want to build or
refname (eg: "origin/pr/9/head").

#### Environment Variables

The plugin makes some very useful environment variables available.

* ghprbActualCommit
* ghprbActualCommitAuthor
* ghprbActualCommitAuthorEmail
* ghprbPullDescription
* ghprbPullId
* ghprbPullLink
* ghprbPullTitle
* ghprbSourceBranch
* ghprbTargetBranch
* ghprbCommentBody
* sha1

#### Job DSL Support

The plugin contains an extension for the Job DSL plugin to add DSL
syntax for configuring the build trigger and the pull request merger
post-build action.

Here is an example showing all DSL syntax elements:

```
job('example') {
    scm {
        git {
            remote {
                github('test-owner/test-project')
                refspec('+refs/pull/*:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*')
            }
            branch('${sha1}')
        }
    }
    triggers {
        githubPullRequest {
            admin('user_1')
            admins(['user_2', 'user_3'])
            userWhitelist('you@you.com')
            userWhitelist(['me@me.com', 'they@they.com'])
            orgWhitelist('my_github_org')
            orgWhitelist(['your_github_org', 'another_org'])
            cron('H/5 * * * *')
            triggerPhrase('OK to test')
            onlyTriggerPhrase()
            useGitHubHooks()
            permitAll()
            autoCloseFailedPullRequests()
            allowMembersOfWhitelistedOrgsAsAdmin()
            extensions {
                commitStatus {
                    context('deploy to staging site')
                    triggeredStatus('starting deployment to staging site...')
                    startedStatus('deploying to staging site...')
                    statusUrl('http://mystatussite.com/prs')
                    completedStatus('SUCCESS', 'All is well')
                    completedStatus('FAILURE', 'Something went wrong. Investigate!')
                    completedStatus('PENDING', 'still in progress...')
                    completedStatus('ERROR', 'Something went really wrong. Investigate!')
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```
