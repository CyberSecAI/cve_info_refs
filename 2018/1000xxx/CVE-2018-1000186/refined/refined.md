Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in **CVE-2018-1000186**:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin (ghprb) had insufficient permission checks in its form validation methods.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing Permission Checks:** Form validation methods lacked permission checks, allowing any user with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to trigger these methods.
*   **CSRF vulnerability:** Form validation methods did not require POST requests, making them susceptible to CSRF attacks.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The lack of permission checks and CSRF protection enabled attackers to make Jenkins send HTTP requests to arbitrary URLs.
*   **Credential Capture:** Attackers could use the vulnerability to connect to attacker-specified URLs using attacker-specified credential IDs, potentially capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery:** An attacker could make Jenkins send requests to internal or external services.
*   **Credential Exposure:** Attackers could capture sensitive credentials stored within Jenkins.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation could potentially lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker would exploit vulnerable form validation methods within the plugin.
*   The attacker could send crafted requests to Jenkins, taking advantage of the lack of CSRF protection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Jenkins instance from the network.

**Additional Notes:**
* The advisory mentions that the vulnerable methods did not require POST requests, leading to CSRF vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerability is fixed by ensuring form validation methods now require POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions.
* The GitHub Pull Request Builder plugin is deprecated and users are encouraged to migrate to the GitHub Branch Source Plugin.
