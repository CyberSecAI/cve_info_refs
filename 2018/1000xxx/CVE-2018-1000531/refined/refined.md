Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `prime-jwt` implementation in versions <= 1.3.0 of the `fusionauth-jwt` library allows unsigned JWTs to be decoded and considered valid by the `JWTDecoder` class, even when a `Verifier` object (intended for signature validation) is provided. The root cause is a lack of validation in the `JWTDecoder` class, specifically that it does not check for the presence of a signature before decoding if verifier objects exist.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **JWT Signature Bypass:** The core vulnerability is the ability to bypass JWT signature verification. This means an attacker can forge a JWT without a valid signature, and the application will still consider it valid.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication/Authorization Bypass:** If JWTs are used for authentication or authorization, an attacker could craft a malicious JWT and gain access to restricted resources or impersonate other users.
- **Data Manipulation:** If JWTs contain claims that are used to control application behavior, an attacker could manipulate those claims to perform unauthorized actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker crafts a JWT that does not have a signature part. The vulnerability lies in the library accepting such unsigned JWTs even when signature verification is intended.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to generate a JWT, even without knowing the secret key used for signing.
- The attacker needs to be able to submit the crafted unsigned JWT to an application that utilizes the vulnerable `fusionauth-jwt` library.
