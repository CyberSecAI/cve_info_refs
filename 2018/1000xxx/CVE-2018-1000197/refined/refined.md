Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000197:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The Black Duck Hub Plugin did not properly implement permission checks for its `/descriptorByName/com.blackducksoftware.integration.hub.jenkins.PostBuildHubScan/config.xml` API endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The plugin's API endpoint allowed access to users with Overall/Read permissions, which should have been restricted to Overall/Administer permission.
*   **Configuration Read/Write Exposure:** The lack of proper permission checks allowed unauthorized users to read and write the plugin's configuration XML.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:**  Unauthorized users could read the plugin's configuration, potentially exposing sensitive information.
*   **Integrity Compromise:** Unauthorized users could modify the plugin's configuration, potentially disrupting functionality or enabling further attacks.
* **Limited Availability:** While not explicitly stated, the ability to modify configurations could potentially lead to availability issues by misconfiguring the plugin.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network-based exploitation:**  Attackers with Overall/Read permissions could make API calls to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a Jenkins user with at least Overall/Read permissions.
*   No special network position is required besides being able to interact with the Jenkins instance.

**Additional details:**

* The vulnerability is present in Black Duck Hub Plugin versions up to and including 3.0.3.
*   The fix is available in version 3.1.0 and newer of the Black Duck Hub plugin.
