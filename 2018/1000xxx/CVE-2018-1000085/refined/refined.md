Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2018-1000085:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how ClamAV parses XAR files. Specifically, a malformed XAR file can cause an out-of-bounds heap read during the `xar_hash_check` function. This occurs due to improper handling of checksum values within the XAR file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds heap read:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to read data beyond the allocated memory region, which could lead to crashes or potentially leak sensitive information.
- **Incorrect Parsing:**  ClamAV incorrectly handles and parses certain XAR files, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a crash of the ClamAV process due to a segmentation fault or ASAN error, leading to a denial of service.
- **Potential arbitrary code execution:** While not explicitly stated for CVE-2018-1000085, the Ubuntu security notice mentions "possibly execute arbitrary code" in relation to CVE-2018-0202, highlighting that out-of-bounds reads or memory corruption can have more severe consequences.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote attacker:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a remote attacker.
- **Maliciously crafted XAR files:** The attack requires the attacker to provide a specially crafted XAR file to ClamAV.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit a malicious XAR file to be processed by ClamAV. This could be via email scanning, web uploads, or other methods where ClamAV is used to scan files.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `xar.c` file, specifically the `xar_hash_check` function and how it processes checksums.
- The fix involves verifying the length of checksum values and handling unknown checksum types to prevent the out-of-bounds read.
- The vulnerability was reported to the upstream project in 2016 and fixed in git, however, a public disclosure was made due to lack of action.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided data includes information from multiple sources: Ubuntu security notices, a Gentoo security advisory, a mailing list discussion, and the commit fixing the issue on GitHub.
- The Ubuntu security notices (USN-3592-1 and USN-3592-2) address both CVE-2018-0202 and CVE-2018-1000085, which were fixed in the same ClamAV update.
- The fix is included in ClamAV version 0.99.4 and later.
