Subject: clamav: Out of bounds read and segfault in xar parser

Hi,

A malformed xar file can cause an out of bounds heap read in clamav (as
usual detectable with asan). If run against a non-asan build clamscan
will still segfault in my tests. Found with afl.

The bug happens in the function xar_hash_check. Despite it being
reported more than a year ago there's still no release with the fix
(however it's been fixed in git).

I fuzzed clamav according to the instructions in this blog post:
<https://foxglovesecurity.com/2016/06/13/finding-pearls-fuzzing-clamav/>

Upstream fix:
<https://github.com/vrtadmin/clamav-devel/commit/d96a6b8bcc7439fa7e3876207aa0a8e79c8451b6>

Upstream bug (not public):
<https://bugzilla.clamav.net/show_bug.cgi?id=11588>

Timeline:
2016-06-15 reported bug
2016-06-21 fix in git
2017-09-29 public disclosure due to lack of upstream action

base64-encoded poc (didn't want to send it as an attachment due to
fear of crashing people's mail scanners. On the other hand I'm sure
there are mail scanners that'll try to decode the base64...):

Meta-level comment:
It seems to me clamav development has mostly stalled. Detection rates
are very low and I'm considering to stop using it for mail filtering.
(also there's of course the whole AV debate, however I never saw
clamav as a security tool, more as something like a spam filter that
prevents crap in my inbox. Still of course it needs to have secure
parsers.)

# ClamAV: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201804-16**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in ClamAV, the worst of
which may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-antivirus/clamav** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.99.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.99.4** |

### Background

ClamAV is a GPL virus scanner.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in ClamAV. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker, through multiple vectors, could execute arbitrary
code, cause a Denial of Service condition, or have other unspecified
impacts.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All ClamAV users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-antivirus/clamav-0.99.4"

```

| [Description](#c0)  Jeld The Dark Elf    2002-02-09 17:16:05 UTC  ``` Attached to this bug is my first .ebuild. It will build and install Falcons Eye. This is a hacked up version of nethack providing graphical representation of th dungeon, monsters, items etc. It depends on SDL libraries and uses yacc during build. Since this is my first experiment at writing .ebuild I am open to any suggestions/improvements etc. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Jeld The Dark Elf    2002-02-09 17:20:23 UTC  ``` Since I seem to have problems creating attachment here is the .ebuild -------------------------------------------cut here---------------------------------------------- #Copyright 2002 Gentoo Technologies, Inc. #Distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License, v2 or later #Author Dmitriy Kropivnitskiy <nigde@mitechki.net>  A=nethack_source_331_jtp_193.zip S=${WORKDIR}/${P} DESCRIPTION="" SRC_URI="<http://falconseye.sourceforge.net/nethack_source_331_jtp_193.zip>" HOMEPAGE="<http://falconseye.sourceforge.net/>"  DEPEND="media-libs/libsdl         dev-util/yacc"  RDEPEND="media-libs/libsdl"  src_unpack() {         unzip /usr/portage/distfiles/${A}  }  src_compile() {         cd ${WORKDIR}/sys/unix         source setup.sh         cd ../../         make PREFIX=/usr GAME=falconseye GAMEDIR=/usr/share/falconseye SHELLDIR=/usr/bin         cd doc         make }  src_install() {         cd ${WORKDIR}         make PREFIX=${D}/usr GAME=falconseye GAMEDIR=${D}/usr/share/falconseye SHELLDIR=${D}/usr/bin install         # Have to remake the shell script with real path information         sed -e 's;/usr/games/lib/nethackdir;/usr/share/falconseye;' \         -e 's;HACKDIR/nethack;HACKDIR/falconseye;' \         < ${WORKDIR}/sys/unix/nethack.sh \         > ${D}/usr/bin/falconseye         cd doc         doman *.6 } -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-09 21:43:32 UTC  ``` Good, except you don't need the A= definition ($A is auto-defined using $SRC_URI by Portage) and you need to add zip to the DEPEND.

Package        : clamav
Version        : 0.99.4+dfsg-1+deb7u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-0202 CVE-2018-1000085

Some vulnerabilities have been found in ClamAV, an open source antivirus
engine:

CVE-2018-0202

    It was found that ClamAV didn't process certain PDF files correctly,
    relating to a heap overflow. Specially crafted PDFs could yield ClamAV
    to crash, resulting in a denial-of-service or potentially execution of
    arbitrary code.

CVE-2018-1000085

    Hanno Böck discovered that ClamAV didn't process XAR files correctly.
    Malformed XAR files could cause ClamAV to crash by an out of bounds
    heap read. This could result in a denial-of-service.

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
0.99.4+dfsg-1+deb7u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your clamav packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
