Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000081:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the `/api/terminal/create` endpoint. This allows an attacker to trick an authenticated user into executing arbitrary commands on the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF vulnerability on the `/api/terminal/create` endpoint.
- Lack of CSRF protection mechanisms (e.g., tokens) on the endpoint.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server by tricking an authenticated user. In the provided example, the attacker creates a directory on the server.
- Full server compromise, if the executed commands were to download and run malicious code.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a malicious webpage crafted by the attacker. This page, when visited by an authenticated user, will trigger the malicious command execution using the user's active session.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious webpage.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in Ajenti user into visiting the malicious webpage.

**Additional details:**
- The provided PoC demonstrates how to send a request to `/api/terminal/create` to execute the command `mkdir /home/edward/Desktop/Test=CSRF_POC`.
- The request is sent with `enctype="text/plain"` and the command is sent within the value attribute of a hidden input.
