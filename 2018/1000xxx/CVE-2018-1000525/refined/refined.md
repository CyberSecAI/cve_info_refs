Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of PHP's `unserialize()` function on user-supplied data. Specifically, the application decodes base64 encoded data from the `restore_form_data` GET parameter and directly passes it to `unserialize()` without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **PHP Object Deserialization:** The core vulnerability is a PHP object deserialization flaw. By crafting a malicious serialized PHP object, an attacker can trigger arbitrary code execution or other unintended behavior when `unserialize()` is called.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary impact is the potential for remote code execution. By injecting a specially crafted serialized object, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Unauthorized actions:** As described, the deserialization of the object can trigger certain methods within the object, allowing the attacker to perform unauthorised actions like execution of code or disclosure of information.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted, base64-encoded, serialized PHP object through the `restore_form_data` parameter within an HTTP GET request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web application to send the malicious HTTP request.
*   **Knowledge of PHP and object serialization:** The attacker must understand PHP object serialization to craft malicious serialized objects.
*   **Knowledge of application's classes:** To achieve RCE, the attacker often needs to know the classes available within the application or its libraries and how they can be leveraged during unserialization.

**Code Location:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `openpsa/lib/midcom/services/auth/frontend/form.php`, specifically lines 45-51.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported on May 29, 2018, and resolved on May 30, 2018.
*   The 0dd.zone blog post mentions that the OpenPSA project "overly trusted user input".
