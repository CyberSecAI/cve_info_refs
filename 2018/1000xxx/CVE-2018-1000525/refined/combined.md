# Issue

An attacker can perform PHP object serialization attacks, which can possibly lead to remote code execution.

# Vulnerable Section

[openpsa/lib/midcom/services/auth/frontend/form.php](https://github.com/flack/openpsa/blob/712d14cb2ba00ad1348b86bc127709a09b53fa21/lib/midcom/services/auth/frontend/form.php#L45-L51)

Lines 45 to 51
in
[712d14c](/flack/openpsa/commit/712d14cb2ba00ad1348b86bc127709a09b53fa21)

|  | if ($request->request->has('restore\_form\_data')) { |
| --- | --- |
|  | foreach ($request->request->get('restored\_form\_data', []) as $key => $string) { |
|  | $value = @unserialize(base64\_decode($string)); |
|  | $request->request->set($key, $value); |
|  | } |
|  | $request->overrideGlobals(); |
|  | } |

The code above displays that base64 encoded GET arguments are unserialized without being sanitised, which causes PHP object serialization attacks.

# OpenPSA PHP Objection Injection

May 31, 2018 · Sajeeb Lohani · CVE-2018-1000525

## The Issue

PHP Object Deserialization Injection attacks utilise the `unserialize` function within PHP. The deserialisation of the PHP object can trigger certain methods within the object, allowing the attacker to perform unauthorised actions like execution of code, disclosure of information, etc.

The OpenPSA project overly trusted user input when processing the data obtained from a form.

## Where the Issue Occurred

Displayed below is the code within the OpenPSA project, in the `openpsa/lib/midcom/services/auth/frontend/form.php` file, where the user input is passed into the `unserialize` function:

```
if ($request->request->has('restore_form_data')) {
    foreach ($request->request->get('restored_form_data', []) as $key => $string) {
        $value = @unserialize(base64_decode($string));
        $request->request->set($key, $value);
    }
    $request->overrideGlobals();
}

```
## Disclosure Timeline

* Issue Reported: 29th May 2018
* Issue Resolved: 30th May 2018
* Blog Post Published: 31st May 2018
* Applied for CVE: 24th June 2018
