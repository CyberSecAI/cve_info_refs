The provided content is related to CVE-2018-1000844.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the use of JAXB which is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.
**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The weakness is the usage of JAXB without proper configuration to prevent XXE attacks, allowing external entities to be loaded during XML processing.
**Impact of exploitation:** The impact of exploitation includes potential for information disclosure, denial of service, server-side request forgery (SSRF) and potentially remote code execution by loading malicious external resources.
**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the processing of a maliciously crafted XML document that includes external entity references.
**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to control or influence the XML input that is processed by the vulnerable JAXB implementation.
