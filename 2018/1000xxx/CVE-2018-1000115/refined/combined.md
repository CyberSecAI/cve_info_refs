Package        : memcached
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-9951 CVE-2018-1000115 CVE-2018-1000127
Debian Bug     : 868701 894404

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in memcached, a high-performance
memory object caching system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2017-9951

    Daniel Shapira reported a heap-based buffer over-read in memcached
    (resulting from an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-8705) triggered by
    specially crafted requests to add/set a key and allowing a remote
    attacker to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2018-1000115

    It was reported that memcached listens to UDP by default. A remote
    attacker can take advantage of it to use the memcached service as a
    DDoS amplifier.

    Default installations of memcached in Debian are not affected by
    this issue as the installation defaults to listen only on localhost.
    This update disables the UDP port by default. Listening on the UDP
    can be re-enabled in the /etc/memcached.conf (cf.
    /usr/share/doc/memcached/NEWS.Debian.gz).

CVE-2018-1000127

    An integer overflow was reported in memcached, resulting in resource
    leaks, data corruption, deadlocks or crashes.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.4.21-1.1+deb8u2.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.33-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your memcached packages.

For the detailed security status of memcached please refer to its
security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/memcached>

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A2857)

## Topic

An update for instack-undercloud and openstack-tripleo-heat-templates is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 8.0 (Liberty) director.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

memcached is a high-performance, distributed memory object caching system, generic in nature, but intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load.

instack-undercloud provides a collection of scripts and elements that can be used to install an OpenStack undercloud (using python-instack).

openstack-tripleo-heat-templates is a collection of OpenStack Orchestration templates and tools (codename heat), which can be used to help deploy OpenStack.

Security Fix(es):

* memcached: UDP server support allows spoofed traffic amplification DoS (CVE-2018-1000115)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Bug Fix(es):

* This update fixes a race condition that could cause pacemaker-managed glance-fs deployments to fail.

Now the glance-fs resource is created from a single node of the overcloud in a way that eliminates the race condition and the resultant deployment failures. (BZ#1418617)

* Prior to this update, the source IP address for cold migration and resize was determined by the default gateway configured on the source compute node.

Now the my\_ip option is explicitly set to the internal\_api network IP in nova.conf, ensuring the correct network is used for this traffic. (BZ#1552855)

## Description

[![@LindenCX](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2645951?u=8e1769463fba074d173338811f83ad8227383f7f&v=4&size=48)](/LindenCX)[LindenCX](https://github.com/LindenCX)opened [on Feb 27, 2018](https://github.com/memcached/memcached/issues/348#issue-300839515)

[2439472](https://github.com/memcached/memcached/commit/2439472aae5960b9b2f8ef93f3f62047a28700f2)

The above commit has resulted in the ability to spoof a victim address to public memcache servers around the world, resulting in a massive amount of data returned from the memcache service. (to the victim)

Simple example:

<https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2018/02/spoofing.png>

These attacks appear to be ranging anywhere from 25Gbps to over 250Gbps.

This has been confirmed on the backlines by many providers, as well as publicly by Cloudflare, and Rapid7.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1552980#c0)  Alan Bishop    2018-03-08 01:29:24 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  When TripleO support for deploying Dell SC and PS Cinder backends was upgraded to support composable roles, a couple of pieces were missed when backported to OSP-10. [1] is the patch that fixed things on ocata, and a variant of the patch will be required for OSP-10.  [1] <https://review.openstack.org/456382>  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):   How reproducible: Always   Steps to Reproduce: 1. Deploy overcloud using the cinder-dellsc-config.yaml or cinder-dellps-config.yaml environment files. 2. 3.  Actual results:  The corresponding Dell SC or PS Cinder backend is not deployed. The deployment will appear to succeed, but the backend settings are completely missing in the controller's /etc/cinder/cinder.conf.  Expected results:  The Dell SC or PS backend settings are present in cinder.conf  Additional info:  The puppet/services/cinder-backend-dellsc.yaml and cinder-backend-dellps.yaml heat template version is wrong. Both files reference Ocata, and need to reference Newton to work in OSP-10.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1552980#c1)  Rajini Karthik    2018-03-08 14:58:49 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1553229](show_bug.cgi?id=1553229 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Backport: Composable service support for Cinder Dell EMC Storage Center") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1552980#c13)  Chris Paquin    2018-05-02 14:47:08 UTC  ``` Any update on this issue.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A1593)

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.0 (Newton).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat OpenStack Platform director provides the facilities for deploying and monitoring a private or public infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud based on Red Hat OpenStack Platform.

Security Fix(es):

* A resource-permission flaw was found in the python-tripleo and openstack-tripleo-heat-templates packages where ceph.client.openstack.keyring is created as world-readable. A local attacker with access to the key could read or modify data on Ceph cluster pools for OpenStack as though the attacker were the OpenStack service, thus potentially reading or modifying data in an OpenStack Block Storage volume.

To exploit this flaw, the attacker must have local access to an overcloud node. However by default, access to overcloud nodes is restricted and accessible only from the management undercloud server on an internal network. (CVE-2017-12155)

This issue was discovered by Katuya Kawakami (NEC).

* It was discovered that the memcached connections using UDP transport protocol can be abused for efficient traffic amplification distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. A remote attacker could send a malicious UDP request using a spoofed source IP address of a target system to memcached, causing it to send a significantly larger response to the target. (CVE-2018-1000115)

This advisory also addresses the following issues:

* This release adds support for deploying Dell EMC VMAX Block Storage backend using the Red Hat OpenStack Platform director. (BZ#1503896)
* Using composable roles for deploying Dell SC and PS Block Storage backend caused errors. The backends could only be deploying using 'cinder::config::cinder\_config' hiera data.

With this update, the composable role support for deploying the Dell SC and PS Block Storage backends is updated. As a result, they can be now deployed using composable roles. (BZ#1552980)

* Previously, the iptables rules were managed by the Red Hat OpenStack Platform director and the OpenStack Networking service, which resulted in the rules created by the OpenStack Networking service to persist on to the disk. As a result, the rules that should not be loaded after an iptables restart or a system reboot would be loaded causing traffic issues.

With this update, the Red Hat OpenStack Platform director has been updated to exclude the OpenStack Networking rules from '/etc/sysconfig/iptables' when the director saves the firewall rules. As a result, iptables restart or a system reboot should work without causing traffic problems.
Note: It might be necessary to perform a rolling restart of the controller nodes to ensure that any orphaned managed neutron rules are no longer reloaded. (BZ#1541528)

* OS::TripleO::SwiftStorage::Ports\* resources have been renamed to OS::TripleO::ObjectStorage::Port\* to ensure standalone Object Storage nodes using the 'ObjectStorage' roles can be deployed correctly. Operators need to modify their custom templates that previously used OS::TripleO::SwiftStorage::Ports\* settings. (BZ#1544802)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

```
As reported, UDP amplification attacks have started to use insecure
internet-exposed memcached instances. UDP used to be a lot more popular as a
transport for memcached many years ago, but I'm not aware of many recent
users.

Ten years ago, the TCP connection overhead from many clients was relatively
high (dozens or hundreds per client server), but these days many clients are
batched, or user fewer processes, or simply anre't worried about it.

While changing the default to listen on localhost only would also help, the
true culprit is UDP. There are many more use cases for using memcached over
the network than there are for using the UDP protocol.

Good decision, but a change like this should include a comment in the code explaining why the port is set to 0 so that it isn't accidentally "fixed" by someone in the future.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| Memcrashed is a tool that allows you to use Shodan.io to obtain hundreds of vulnerable  |
| memcached servers. It then allows you to use the same servers to launch widespread      |
| distributed denial of service attacks by forging UDP packets sourced to your victim.    |
| Default payload includes the memcached "stats" command, 10 bytes to send, but the reply |
| is between 1,500 bytes up to hundreds of kilobytes. Please use this tool responsibly.   |

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1550167#c0)  Alex Schultz    2018-02-28 17:02:03 UTC  ``` osp11  +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1545666](show_bug.cgi?id=1545666 "CLOSED ERRATA - validation-scripts/all-nodes.sh wait time verification") +++  Description of problem: I would like to report a possible fault in validation script:  /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/validation-scripts/all-nodes.sh  There is a function   function ping_retry() {   local IP_ADDR=$1   local TIMES=${2:-'10'}   local COUNT=0   local PING_CMD=ping   if [[ $IP_ADDR =~ ":" ]]; then     PING_CMD=ping6   fi   until [ $COUNT -ge $TIMES ]; do     if $PING_CMD -w 300 -c 1 $IP_ADDR &> /dev/null; then       echo "Ping to $IP_ADDR succeeded."       return 0     fi     echo "Ping to $IP_ADDR failed. Retrying..."     COUNT=$(($COUNT + 1))   done   return 1 }  Problematic line here is  $PING_CMD -w 300 -c 1 $IP_ADDR  According to man ping:        -w deadline               Specify  a  timeout,  in seconds, before ping exits regardless of how many packets have been sent or received. In this case ping does not stop after count packet are sent, it waits either for deadline expire or until count probes are answered or for some error notification from network.  So, "-w 300" means 300 seconds deadline wait. and repeat this up to 10 times as per TIMES variable This would provide a timeout of 3000 seconds or 50 minutes for the ping to complete on the worst case scenario.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): openstack-tripleo-heat-templates-5.3.3-1.el7ost.noarch.rpm    Actual results: if "some error notification from network" is received, the ping will not wait "-w 300", it will exit quite fast.  Here is a test, where I ping a non-existing IP address in a existing subnet:  [VNF11 VPOD3 stack@director validation-scripts]$ time ping -w 300 -c 1 10.33.110.150 PING 10.33.110.150 (10.33.110.150) 56(84) bytes of data. From 10.33.110.133 icmp_seq=1 Destination Host Unreachable From 10.33.110.133 icmp_seq=2 Destination Host Unreachable From 10.33.110.133 icmp_seq=3 Destination Host Unreachable From 10.33.110.133 icmp_seq=4 Destination Host Unreachable  --- 10.33.110.150 ping statistics --- 4 packets transmitted, 0 received, +4 errors, 100% packet loss, time 2999ms pipe 4  real    0m3.008s user    0m0.000s sys     0m0.002s  The ping exited in 3 seconds. If this happens during deployment, it would provide a timeout of 3 * 10 = 30 seconds.  30 seconds is too short if this ping must be made over bonded interface with LACP.    Expected results:  It takes anywhere between 30 and 60 seconds for LACP to become functional.  It does not matter is the slow or fast LACP mode is used on the switches, 30 seconds is a borderline minimum, and is not enough.  --- Additional comment from Dariusz Wojewódzki on 2018-02-15 08:33:13 EST ---  I noticed this has been changed in OSP12, openstack-tripleo-heat-templates-7.0.3-22.el7ost.noarch.rpm:       if $PING_CMD -w 10 -c 1 $IP_ADDR &> /dev/null; then   Is it possible to implement it to OSP11 and OSP10?   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1550167#c9)  Gurenko Alex    2018-05-13 13:07:32 UTC  ``` Verified on puddle 2018-05-03.2  [stack@undercloud-0 ~]$ sed -n 13,19p /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/validation-scripts/all-nodes.sh     if $PING_CMD -w 10 -c 1 $IP_ADDR &> /dev/null; then       echo "Ping to $IP_ADDR succeeded."       return 0     fi     echo "Ping to $IP_ADDR failed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1552759#c0)  Rafal Szmigiel    2018-03-07 16:44:13 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  Deployment of HCI enabled OpenStack Platform 12 fails when using Nova Scheduler Hints.  (undercloud) [stack@director ~]$ ./deploy-now-hci.sh Started Mistral Workflow tripleo.validations.v1.check_pre_deployment_validations. Execution ID: 79e884c9-05cb-474b-9f30-6292a70cdba4 Waiting for messages on queue '51484ca6-4916-4d91-acfc-57145bf63494' with no timeout. Removing the current plan files Uploading new plan files Started Mistral Workflow tripleo.plan_management.v1.update_deployment_plan. Execution ID: e71ebf09-9c80-44a9-82d7-64538c6291eb Plan updated. Processing templates in the directory /tmp/tripleoclient-koTgrN/tripleo-heat-templates Invoking workflow (tripleo.derive_params.v1.derive_parameters) specified in plan-environment file Started Mistral Workflow tripleo.derive_params.v1.derive_parameters. Execution ID: acea8816-4e38-466a-a8e8-cb223eca0ac4 Workflow execution is failed: [{u'status': u'SUCCESS', u'message': u'', u'role_name': u'Controller'}, {u'status': u'FAILED', u'message': u'Unable to determine profile for flavor (flavor name: baremetal)', u'role_name': u'Compute'}]   It doesn't matter whether I use Compute or ComputeHCI roles. As soon as OS::TripleO::Services::CephOSD is added to the role deployment fails with the error above.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): [root@director stack]# rpm -qa | grep -i tripleo python-tripleoclient-7.3.3-7.el7ost.noarch openstack-tripleo-ui-7.4.3-4.el7ost.noarch openstack-tripleo-image-elements-7.0.1-1.el7ost.noarch puppet-tripleo-7.4.3-11.el7ost.noarch openstack-tripleo-common-containers-7.6.3-10.el7ost.noarch openstack-tripleo-heat-templates-7.0.3-22.el7ost.noarch openstack-tripleo-validations-7.4.2-1.el7ost.noarch openstack-tripleo-puppet-elements-7.0.1-2.el7ost.noarch openstack-tripleo-common-7.6.3-10.el7ost.noarch  How reproducible: Every time when deploying OS::TripleO::Services::CephOSD on Compute node.   Steps to Reproduce:  1. Generate roles_data.yaml file: [stack@director templates]$ openstack overcloud roles generate -o /home/stack/templates/hci/roles_data.yaml Controller Compute  2. Add OS::TripleO::Services::CephOSD service to the Compute role.  3. Use scheduler hints file to control node placement: [stack@director templates]$ cat scheduler_hints_env.yaml  parameter_defaults:   ControllerSchedulerHints:     'capabilities:node': 'overcloud-controller-%index%'   ComputeSchedulerHints:     'capabilities:node': 'overcloud-compute-%index%'   CephStorageSchedulerHints:     'capabilities:node': 'overcloud-ceph-%index%'  4. Run the deployment including customized roles_data.yaml and scheduler_hints_env.yaml  5. Observe error: Workflow execution is failed: [{u'status': u'SUCCESS', u'message': u'', u'role_name': u'Controller'}, {u'status': u'FAILED', u'message': u'Unable to determine profile for flavor (flavor name: baremetal)', u'role_name': u'Compute'}]  Actual results: Deployment fails.  Expected results: Deployment uses scheduler hints instead of flavor/profiles and finish successfully.

Thanks in advance,  Rafal   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1552759#c4)  Saravanan KR    2018-03-28 09:52:04 UTC  ``` This deployment is using the derive parameters workflow by using the "-p" option in the deploy command. In order to use this feature, the nodes and flavors should be tagged with matching profile. And Overcloud<RoleName>Flavor parameters should provide the matching flavor name to use. In this error, there are not flavor mentioned in the parameters, which defaults to 'baremetal' and it is failing. Ensure the correct flavor name is provided.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1552759#c5)  Rafal Szmigiel    2018-03-28 10:37:21 UTC  ``` Hey Saravanan,  This deployment uses SchedulerHints therefore no flavors other than baremetal should be used. Please check <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/12/html/advanced_overcloud_customization/sect-controlling_node_placement#sect-Assign_Specific_Node_IDs> for more details.  Rafał   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1552759#c6)  Saravanan KR    2018-03-28 10:47:30 UTC  ``` (In reply to Rafal Szmigiel from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1552759#c5)) > Hey Saravanan, >  > This deployment uses SchedulerHints therefore no flavors other than > baremetal should be used. Please check > <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/12/> > html/advanced_overcloud_customization/sect-controlling_node_placement#sect- > Assign_Specific_Node_IDs for more details.  Derive parameters workflow supports only the role tagging and does NOT support SchedulerHints yet. Though it was earlier planned to support, but work has not started yet. Two options from here - Either you could use derive parameters with role-tagging OR use scheduler hints by providing the parameters manually without -p option. I have added Alan Bishop and Jagan who were working on the current version of derived parameters.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1552759#c7)  Rafal Szmigiel    2018-03-28 10:51:28 UTC  ``` Thanks for the clarification and looping Alan and Jagan.  Best Regards,  Rafal   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1552759#c8)  Alan Bishop    2018-03-28 11:56:49 UTC  ``` Just to clarify Saravanan's comment, the Derived Parameters workflow relies on role tagging, but this is not incompatible with SchedulerHints. It's OK to continue to specify SchedulerHints, but you also need the nodes for which you want parameters derived (i.e. HCI) to be tagged with a role/profile. This is necessary for the Derived Parameters workflow to identify the nodes so that it can determine their hardware characteristics. This should provide a workaround until we can fix the workflow so that it can use just the SchedulerHints.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1552759#c9)  Alan Bishop    2018-05-03 16:33:28 UTC  ``` Patch merged upstream, and I've begun upstream backports to stable/queens and stable/pike.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1552759#c14)  Yogev Rabl    2018-07-30 17:03:36 UTC  ``` Verified, deployed successfully with scheduler hints   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1552759#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-08-20 12:59:02 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

## Topic

An update is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11.0 (Ocata).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat OpenStack Platform director provides the facilities for deploying
and monitoring a private or public infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud
based on Red Hat OpenStack Platform.

Security Fix(es):

* A resource-permission flaw was found in the python-tripleo and openstack-tripleo-heat-templates packages where ceph.client.openstack.keyring is created as world-readable. A local attacker with access to the key could read or modify data on Ceph cluster pools for OpenStack as though the attacker were the OpenStack service, thus potentially reading or modifying data in an OpenStack Block Storage volume.

To exploit this flaw, the attacker must have local access to an overcloud node. However by default, access to overcloud nodes is restricted and accessible only from the management undercloud server on an internal network. (CVE-2017-12155)

This issue was discovered by Katuya Kawakami (NEC).

* It was discovered that the memcached connections using UDP transport protocol can be abused for efficient traffic amplification distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. A remote attacker could send a malicious UDP request using a spoofed source IP address of a target system to memcached, causing it to send a significantly larger response to the target. (CVE-2018-1000115)

This update also includes the following bug fixes and enhancements:

* Prior to this update, when removing the ceph-osd RPM from overcloud nodes that do not require the package, the corresponding Ceph OSD product key was not removed. Consequently, the subscription-manager would incorrectly report that the Ceph OSD product was still installed.

With this update, the script that handles removal of the ceph-osd RPM now also removes the Ceph OSD product key. Note: The script that removes the RPM and product key executes only during the overcloud update procedure; the product key is removed only when the overcloud node is updated.
As a result, after removing the ceph-osd RPM, the subscription-manager no longer reports the Ceph OSD product is installed. (BZ#1571436)

* Previously, there were errors in the director Heat template that configures the VMAX Cinder backend driver. Consequently, the VMAX driver would not function correctly. With this update, the errors have been corrected, and the VMAX driver functions correctly. (BZ#1546799)
* This enhancement adds director support for deploying the Dell EMC VMAX cinder backend. (BZ#1546793)
* In this enhancement, if a minor update is blocked by an existing yum process that prevents the package update, the process should exit with an appropriate error message. This was added because the minor update may appear to freeze, due to yum waiting for the existing yum.pid to exit; when it eventually fails it is not immediately clear why. As a result, if there is an existing yum process preventing the package update, then the minor update fails with a clear message to indicate this: "ERROR existing yum.pid detected - can't continue! Please ensure there is no other package update process for the duration of the minor update worfklow. Exiting". (BZ#1471721)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1550934#c0)  ojanas    2018-03-02 10:14:15 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  Customer is trying to configure Active Directory as an Idm in keystone.  According to the documentation at: <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/12/html/integrate_with_identity_service/sec-active-directory#configure_the_ldaps_certificate>  there is one part doing: # cp addc.lab.local.pem /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/ # update-ca-trust  The problem is that the host path /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors is not mounted into the keystone container so the certificate, obviously, can not be found inside the container.  The workaround is to manually copy the certificate into the container.  The solution seems to be simple, just add another mount into the container if there is no conflict.  How reproducible:  Run this on OSP 12 controller node:  docker inspect -f '{{.Mounts}}' <ID of keystone container>  From the output you can see the appropriate mount is missing.  Actual results: There is a missing mount in the keystone container.  Expected results: The mount is not missing inside the keystone container   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1550934#c1)  John Dennis    2018-03-19 16:08:33 UTC  ``` FWIW, it's not just the /etc/pki/catrust/source/anchors that's needed, but also /etc/pki/tls/certs because that's where the update-ca-trust writes what is in source/anchors and where the TLS libraries read the set of trusted CA's.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1550934#c2)  Juan Antonio Osorio    2018-03-19 16:12:12 UTC  ``` These are mounted already:  "/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted:/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted:ro", "/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.trust.crt:/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.trust.crt:ro", "/etc/pki/tls/cert.pem:/etc/pki/tls/cert.pem:ro", "/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt:/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt:ro"   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1550934#c3)  John Dennis    2018-03-21 18:58:55 UTC  ``` After reviewing the documentation in listed in the original bug report it would appear there is an erroneous step listed. We believe (but have not yet confirmed via testing) there is no need to add the AD CA cert to the hosts system trust via update-ca-trust (which reads it from /etc/pki/catrust/source/anchors. There are two reasons for this conclusion.  1) The document was not written with containers in mind. As a general rule a container running on a host should not modify or have the ability to modify the hosts security profile. By giving a container write access to /etc/pki/catrust/source/anchors the container is able to inject any CA cert into the host systems trust profile. Providing a read-only mount in the container is nonsensical because /etc/pki/catrust/source/anchors is where you *write* CA certs that will then be added by update-ca-trust.  2) Keystone's LDAP implementation does not utilize the CA trust of the system irregardless of whether Keystone is running natively on the host or inside a container running on the host. Rather the CA cert used by Keystone's LDAPS is a file or directory specified by either the tls_cacertfile or tls_cacertdir Keystone configuration parameters.  I communicated with the original doc writer and asked if he recalled any reason why the AD CA cert needed to be added to the system trust instead of just pointing Keystone to the AD CA cert. He couldn't remember any reason and though maybe he added that to support testing with the ldapsearch command line tool.  Thus 3 things need to happen:  1) We should verify there is no need for the AD CA cert to be added to the system trust.  2) Assuming the above is verified we need to update the doc.  3) We still need a mechanism to have the AD CA cert be visible in the container so that Keystone can reference the file specified in the tls_cacertfile. I need to coordinate more with Ozz (e.g. Juan) to determine the best mechanism for this. We've already outlined a few ideas.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1550934#c20)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-08-20 12:59:02 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

### Memcached 1.5.6 Release Notes

Date: 2018-2-27

### Download

<http://www.memcached.org/files/memcached-1.5.6.tar.gz>

### Overview

This is a bugfix release, but it primarily disables the UDP protocol by default.

In the last few days reports of UDP amplification attacks utilizing inesure
memcached instances have surfaced. Attackers are able to set large values into
memcached, then send requests via spoofed UDP packets. Memcached will then
send a very large number of very large UDP packets back in response.

12 years ago, the UDP version of the protocol had more widespread use: TCP
overhead could be very high. In the last few years, I've not heard of anyone
using UDP anymore. Proxies and special clients allow connection reuse, which
lowers the overhead. Also, RAM values are so large that TCP buffers just don't
add up as much as they used to.

That said, I don't have any way of knowing how many UDP installations there
are. Everyone who uses UDP and upgrades past this version, will find the UDP
protocol disabled unless they explicitly enable it via `-U 11211`. Hopefully
this one-time pain is acceptable.

Thanks for everyone who reached out in the last couple days to help understand
the problem and coordinate patches sent to linux and BSD distro's.

### Fixes

* disable UDP port by default
* systemd instancing support & rpm build improvements
* fix gcc warnings in beta GCC
* fix build with clang
* fix for dtrace compilation on freebsd

### New Features

The RPM specfiles have been greatly improved for systemd installations, see:
<https://github.com/memcached/memcached/commit/7141922a6188b00bc542b29c578506e0db52c9c7>
for full detail.

### Contributors

The following people contributed to this release since 1.5.5.

Note that this is based on who contributed changes, not how they were
done. In many cases, a code snippet on the mailing list or a bug
report ended up as a commit with your name on it.

Note that this is just a summary of how many changes each person made
which doesn't necessarily reflect how significant each change was.
For details on what led up into a branch, either grab the git repo and
look at the output of `git log 1.5.5..1.5.6` or use a web view.

# USN-3588-1: Memcached vulnerabilities

5 March 2018

Several security issues were fixed in Memcached.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 17.10](/security/notices?release=artful)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [memcached](/security/cves?package=memcached) - high-performance memory object caching system

## Details

Daniel Shapira discovered an integer overflow issue in Memcached. A remote

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (daemon crash).

([CVE-2017-9951](/security/CVE-2017-9951))

It was discovered that Memcached listened to UDP by default. A remote

attacker could use this as part of a distributed denial of service attack.

([CVE-2018-1000115](/security/CVE-2018-1000115))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 17.10

* [memcached](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/memcached)
  -
  [1.4.33-1ubuntu3.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/memcached/1.4.33-1ubuntu3.2)

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [memcached](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/memcached)
  -
  [1.4.25-2ubuntu1.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/memcached/1.4.25-2ubuntu1.3)

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [memcached](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/memcached)
  -
  [1.4.14-0ubuntu9.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/memcached/1.4.14-0ubuntu9.2)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

Please note that after applying this update, Memcached will no longer

listen to UDP by default. If UDP service is desired, please add

'-U 11211' to /etc/memcached.conf and restart the memcached service.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1517269#c0)  Ollie Walsh    2017-11-24 12:51:59 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1466882](show_bug.cgi?id=1466882 "CLOSED EOL - openstack-nova-migration is potentially missing after a minor update") +++  Description of problem: If the initial attempt to update fails it could have updated packages but not run the puppet manifest that installs openstack-nova-migration. Subsequent attempts to update will not install the openstack-nova-migration package as we disable pkg installs if no updates are available.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): openstack-tripleo-heat-templates-2.0.0-57.el7ost.noarch  How reproducible: Could not reproduce. Discovered this during code review.   Additional info: Forked from [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1463680](show_bug.cgi?id=1463680 "CLOSED NOTABUG - \"Invalid parameter transport on Class[Nova::Migration::Libvirt]\" notice while scaleout")  --- Additional comment from Ollie Walsh on 2017-09-12 21:35:09 IST ---    --- Additional comment from Ollie Walsh on 2017-11-23 18:54:20 GMT ---   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1517269#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-10-02 18:46:50 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

**Detail**

* CVE-2018-1000115
  + Severity: Important
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 5.3
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)
  + Memcached version 1.5.5 contains an Insufficient Control of Network Message Volume (Network Amplification, CWE-406) vulnerability in the UDP support of the memcached server that can result in denial of service via network flood (traffic amplification of 1:50,000 has been reported by reliable sources). This attack appear to be exploitable via network connectivity to port 11211 UDP. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in 1.5.6 due to the disabling of the UDP protocol by default.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1551182#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2018-03-03 04:55:19 UTC  ``` memcached supports TCP and UDP servers, when the UDP server is enabled, and the configuration does not specify localhost or 127.0.0.1, and the server does not firewall the memcached port (11211 by default) can be exploited for network traffic amplification attacks by spoofed UDP packets.  Please note that by default the firewall on Red Hat Enterprise Linux only allows port 22 (SSH) inbound, so systems with memcached enabled are only affected if a firewall rule is added that allows UDP traffic to connect to memcached (by default on port 11211).   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1551182#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2018-03-03 13:58:20 UTC  ``` memcached upstream disabled UDP by default in version 1.5.6:  <https://github.com/memcached/memcached/wiki/ReleaseNotes156>  Relevant upstream commit:  <https://github.com/memcached/memcached/commit/dbb7a8af90054bf4ef51f5814ef7ceb17d83d974>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1551182#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2018-03-05 12:15:22 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat is aware of traffic amplification distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that take advantage of the insecurely configured memcached servers reachable from the public Internet. The default configuration of memcached as shipped in Red Hat products makes it possible to abuse them for these DDoS attacks if memcached is exposed to connections from the public Internet. Refer to the Red Hat Knowledgebase article 3369081 for instructions on how to properly secure memcached installations to prevent them from being used in the attack.  <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3369081>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1551182#c4)  Clifford Perry    2018-03-05 13:43:04 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Please refer to the Red Hat Knowledgebase article 3369081 for instructions on how to properly secure memcached installations to prevent them from being used in an attack.  <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3369081>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1551182#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2018-03-05 16:03:09 UTC  ``` Note that this issue is further mitigated by the default Fedora configuration, which makes memcached listen on loopback addresses only.  The change of this default was done in Fedora 25, see [bug 1182542](show_bug.cgi?id=1182542 "CLOSED RAWHIDE - Memcache should listen only on localhost").  <https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/memcached/c/3ee983ab6353cb0613d03913dcc8b7dd3c9637c5>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1551182#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2018-03-05 16:04:25 UTC  ``` Created memcached tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1551655](show_bug.cgi?id=1551655 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-1000115 memcached: UDP server support allows spoofed traffic amplification DoS [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1551182#c10)  Summer Long    2018-03-06 01:23:45 UTC  ``` Created memcached tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: openstack-rdo [[bug 1551839](show_bug.cgi?id=1551839 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2018-1000115 memcached: UDP server support allows spoofed traffic amplification DoS [openstack-rdo]")]   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1551182#c14)  Alex Schultz    2018-03-19 20:15:55 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1553274](show_bug.cgi?id=1553274 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Restrict memcached on overcloud nodes to listen to tcp only") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1551182#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-05-17 15:40:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.0 (Newton)  Via RHSA-2018:1593 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:1593](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A1593)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1551182#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-05-18 17:02:55 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11.0 (Ocata)  Via RHSA-2018:1627 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:1627](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A1627)   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1551182#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-08-20 12:56:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 12.0 (Pike)  Via RHSA-2018:2331 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2331](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2331)   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1551182#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-10-02 18:46:47 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 8.0 (Liberty) director  Via RHSA-2018:2857 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2857](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2857)   ``` |  |

## Topic

Updated packages that resolve various issues are now available for Red Hat
OpenStack Platform 9.0 director for RHEL 7.

## Description

Red Hat OpenStack Platform director provides the facilities for deploying
and monitoring a private or public infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud
based on Red Hat OpenStack Platform.

Changes to the openstack-tripleo-heat-templates component:

* The operator can override any SNMP configuration with a new parameter, SnmpdConfigOverride. With this parameter, the operator must include all of the SNMP configuration requirements, including usernames and passwords. Red Hat OpenStack director does not place any restrictions on the content of SnmpdConfigOverride. (BZ#1556958)

## Solution

Before applying this update, ensure all previously released errata relevant
to your system have been applied.

* An explanation of the way in which the provided components interact to

form a working cloud computing environment.

* Technology Previews, Recommended Practices, and Known Issues.
* The channels required for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 9, including which

channels need to be enabled and disabled.
