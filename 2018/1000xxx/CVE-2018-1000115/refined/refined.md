Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000115:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The memcached service, by default, listened for connections via UDP. This allowed attackers to send spoofed UDP packets to memcached servers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **UDP Amplification:** The vulnerability arises from the combination of memcached's UDP support and the ability to send spoofed UDP packets. Attackers could send a small UDP request with a spoofed source IP address (the victim) to a vulnerable memcached server. The server would then respond with a larger reply to the spoofed address, leading to traffic amplification.
*   **Default UDP Listening:** Memcached's default configuration, where it listens on UDP port 11211, made it susceptible to exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS):** Attackers used vulnerable memcached servers as amplifiers in DDoS attacks, directing massive amounts of traffic toward victim systems. This could overwhelm network resources and cause a denial of service.
*   **Traffic Amplification:** The size of responses generated by memcached was significantly larger than the size of requests, leading to traffic amplification factors that could reach 50,000 or more.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attack was performed over a network using UDP.
*   **Spoofed UDP Packets:** Attackers sent specially crafted UDP packets with spoofed source IP addresses to vulnerable memcached servers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** Attackers could be anywhere on the network, as long as they could send UDP packets to vulnerable memcached instances.
*   **UDP Packet Spoofing:** The attacker required the ability to send spoofed UDP packets to vulnerable servers to make them respond to the victim.

**Additional Details (from the content):**
*  Some content shows that the vulnerability was fixed in memcached version 1.5.6 by disabling the UDP protocol by default.
* Red Hat mentions that installations of memcached in their products are vulnerable if a firewall rule is added that allows UDP traffic to connect to memcached.
* Debian states that their default memcached installations listen only on localhost and therefore are not vulnerable, also noting that the UDP port is disabled by default after the update.
* Red Hat OpenStack Platform was also affected by this vulnerability.
* Several sources note that a traffic amplification of 1:50,000 has been observed for this vulnerability.
