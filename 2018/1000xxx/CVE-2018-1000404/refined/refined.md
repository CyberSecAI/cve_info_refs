Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000404:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The AWS CodeBuild plugin stored the AWS Secret Key in plain text within the job's `config.xml` file on the Jenkins controller.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Plaintext Storage:** The AWS Secret Key was stored unencrypted in the plugin's configuration files.
- **Plaintext Transfer:** The AWS Secret Key was transmitted in plain text to users when accessing the job configuration form, even though it was masked in the UI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Exposure:** Users with "Extended Read" permission or file system access to the Jenkins controller could view the unencrypted AWS Secret Key.
- **Unauthorized Access:** The exposed AWS Secret Key could be used to gain unauthorized access to AWS resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File System Access:** Attackers could directly access the Jenkins controller's file system and read the `config.xml` files.
- **Access to Job Configuration Form:** Attackers with "Extended Read" access could view the job's configuration form and capture the secret key transmitted in plain text.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Jenkins User Account:** The attacker needs a Jenkins user account with either:
    - "Extended Read" permissions, or
    - direct access to the Jenkins controller's file system.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is specific to versions of the AWS CodeBuild plugin up to and including 0.26.
- The fix involves encrypting the AWS Secret Key in the configuration file on disk and preventing plaintext transfer to the user interface.
- Existing jobs need to have their configuration saved again for the fix to overwrite previously stored plaintext secret keys.
