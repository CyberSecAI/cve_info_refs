## Description

WP User Groups allows users to be categorized using custom taxonomies & terms.

* “Groups” & “Types” are created by default, and can be overridden
* More user group types can be registered with custom arguments
* Edit users and set their relationships
* Bulk edit many users to quickly assign several at once
* Filter the users list to see which users are in what groups
* Not destructive data storage (plugin can be enabled & disabled without damage)
* Works great with all WP User & Term plugins (see below)

When you need to group your many users beyond just their role, this is the pluging. Works very well, properly coded.

I’ve been using this for a fairly complex WP build and I’ve been very impressed. The back-end is easy for users and there’s a nice API for devs. Two thumbs up.

### [Solid foundation for development](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/solid-foundation-for-development/)

[Chris Reynolds](https://profiles.wordpress.org/jazzs3quence/ "Posts by Chris Reynolds")

This plugin is tremendously solid. Used it to build a complex system of content teams who could only create or edit content within their own team. WP User Groups handled the “teams” of users which corresponded with taxonomy terms associated with the content. Works like a charm. Plugin itself is lightweight and simple to grasp.

After installing but NOT activating this plugin, other plugin we have called Appointments+ completely vanished from our backend.

Dead-simple to get set up and start using. Works great in combination with BuddyPress too. Filter site members into as many different groups and/or types as you need in the admin backend. I haven’t yet tried doing anything front-end wise with it, but I’m sure there’s potential there for devs.
If, like me, you need to filter down long lists of members for occasional admin tasks, this is for you.

## Advisory:

# CSRF in WP User Groups allows anybody to modify user groups and types

## Vulnerability

Last revised: May 11, 2018

WP User Groups creates new bulk actions to put users into (or remove them from) “groups” and “types”. A nonce is sent with the request, but it is not checked.

Current state:
 Fixed

## CVSS Summary

CVSS base scores for this vulnerability
| Score 4.3 Medium | |
| --- | --- |
| Vector | Network |
| Complexity | Medium |
| Authentication | None |
| Confidentiality | None |
| Integrity | Partial |
| Availability | None |

You can read more about CVSS base scores on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVSS) or in the [CVSS specification](http://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-guide).

## Proof of concept

* Activate the plugin
* Make sure you have a user with user\_id=1
* Visit http://localhost/wp-admin/edit-tags.php?taxonomy=user-group and create a group called “Cat” with slug “cat”
* Visit http://localhost/wp-admin/users.php?users%5B%5D=1&action2=add-cat-user-group
* If you go back to http://localhost/wp-admin/users.php you’ll see the user with user\_id=1 is now in the group “Cat”
