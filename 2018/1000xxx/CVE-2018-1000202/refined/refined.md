The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2018-1000202.

**CVE-2018-1000202**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Groovy Postbuild Plugin did not properly escape badge content from user input.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
*  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the badge content, which will then be executed in the browsers of other users who view the page containing the badge. This could lead to session hijacking, information theft, or other malicious activities performed in the context of the victim's session.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects malicious script in the badge content, which is then stored by the plugin. When other users view the page with the badge, the malicious script is executed.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permission in Jenkins and be able to configure the Groovy Postbuild plugin, specifically the badge content. User interaction is also required in order to trigger the XSS vulnerability.
