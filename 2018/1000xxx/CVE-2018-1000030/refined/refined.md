  "CVE-2018-1000030": {
    "description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in Python 2.7's readahead feature of file objects, which is not thread-safe. Reading from the same file object in different threads can cause a crash due to a race condition in the readahead buffer. This issue is not present in Python 3, where the I/O stack was rewritten with a different design using locks to prevent race conditions. A fix was implemented in Python 2.7.15.",
    "root_cause": "The readahead feature of file objects in Python 2.7 is not thread-safe.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition",
      "Thread unsafety",
      "Buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code, although this is less likely.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Concurrent reads from the same file object using different threads."
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to execute code within a Python 2.7 application that reads the same file object from multiple threads, typically done by running their own code.",
    "additional_details": "The initial fix involved raising a RuntimeError when concurrent file operations were detected which was later replaced with a fix involving caching buffer state thread-locally for the duration of a file_iternext call and only updating the file's internal state after reading completes due to regressions, and no attempt is made to define or provide \"reasonable\" semantics for iterating over a file on multiple threads, and duplicated, corrupt, and missing data may happen"
