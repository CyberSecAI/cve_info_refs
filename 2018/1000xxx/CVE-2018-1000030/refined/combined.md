| ``` The bug was first reported to the private Python security mailing list. The PSRT decided that it's a regular bug and doesn't need to be categorized as a vulnerability, since the attacker has to be able to run arbitrary code in practice.  The PSRT considers that no Python 2.7 application currently rely on reading from the same file object "at the same time" from different thread, since it currently crashs.  So an attacker would have to run his/her own code... but if an attacker can already run arbitrary code, why relying on an unstable race condition and inject machine code (so not portable), whereas Python standard library is full of nice features to write your portable exploit?  For more information, see the Python security model: <https://python-security.readthedocs.io/security.html#security-model> ``` | | | |

| ``` Python 3 is not affected by this bug.  In Python 3, the full I/O stack was rewritten from scratchn, the new io module has a different design. Reading ahead still exists in the io module, but it is now done by a dedicated object: io.BufferedReader, and this object uses a lock to prevent concurrent reads. A single thread controls the file position at the same time. (Except if a different thread uses directly the file descriptor, but that's a different story.) ``` | | | |
| [msg302615](#msg302615) - [(view)](msg302615) | Author: STINNER Victor (vstinner) \* (Python committer) | Date: 2017-09-20 13:53 |
| ``` In Python 3, reading ahead is implemented by _io.BufferedReader. This object uses a lock to provide a prevent race condition: it's not only to prevent crashes, but also provide warranties on how the file is read.  If thread A calls read() first, it gets the next bytes. If thread B calls read() while thread A is filling the internal file buffer ("readahead buffer"?), the second read is queued. The file position is only controlled by a single thread at the same time.  _PyOS_URandom() uses a similar strategy than Benjamin's proposed patch for the cached file descriptor of /dev/urandom:      fd = _Py_open("/dev/urandom", O_RDONLY);     if (fd < 0) {         ...         return -1;     }     if (urandom_cache.fd >= 0) {         /* urandom_fd was initialized by another thread while we were            not holding the GIL, keep it. */         close(fd);         fd = urandom_cache.fd;     }     else {         ...         urandom_cache.fd = fd;     }  The difference is that opening /dev/urandom multiple times in parallel is safe, whereas reading from the same file descriptor in parellel... using the buffered fread()... is not safe. readahead() can require multiple fread() calls, so multiple read() syscalls. Interlaced reads in parallel is likely to return scrambled data.  Adding a lock in Python 2.7.15 can impact performances even on single threaded applications.  I'm not sure what whaters more here: performance or correctness?  Note: Even the awesome Python 3 io module has same flaws! <https://bugs.python.org/issue12215> "TextIOWrapper: issues with interlaced read-write"  The question is more *who* reads from the same file object in parallel? Does it make sense? :-) Do you expect that file.read(n) is "atomic" in term of parallelism?  Note 2: the io module is also available in Python 2.7, just not used by default by the builtin open() function ;-) io.open() must be used explicitly. ``` | | | |

| ``` The patch is complex. What if just deny reentrant reads? Set a flag while read into a buffer, check it before reading in other thread, and raise RuntimeError. ``` | | | |
| [msg302618](#msg302618) - [(view)](msg302618) | Author: STINNER Victor (vstinner) \* (Python committer) | Date: 2017-09-20 14:04 |
| ``` Serhiy: "What if just deny reentrant reads? Set a flag while read into a buffer, check it before reading in other thread, and raise RuntimeError."  io.BufferedReader/io.BufferedWriter raises a RuntimeError exception for reentrant call, but only in the same thread. For example, it ease debug for signal handlers which trigger such reentrant call.  I'm not sure about 0001-stop-crashes-when-iterating-over-a-file-on-multiple-.patch since it doesn't fix the consistency: two parallel readline() calls can return the same line, instead of being mutual exclusive and only return different lines.  I'm not sure about adding a new lock. "Lock" sounds like "dead locks". I dislike the risk of introducing dead locks very late in the Python 2.7 development cycle.  I like the idea of a simple exception on concurrent operations. But I'm not sure how much code it will break :-/ Crazy idea: would it make sense to raise an exception by default, but add an opt-in option to ignore the exception? I wrote "crazy" since it became clear that the code is not thread-safe and so that parallel operations on the same file object is likely to corrupt data in various funny ways. ``` | | | |

| ``` It's difficult to make a choice between Benjamin's [PR 3670](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/3670 "GitHub PR 3670: [merged] [3.8] bpo-42508: Keep IDLE running on macOS (GH-23577)") and Serhiy's [PR 3672](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/3672 "GitHub PR 3672: [merged] [3.8] bpo-41889: [Enum] fix multiple-inheritance regression (GH-22487)").  Benjamin wrote that about his PR:  > No attempt is made to define or provide "reasonable" semantics for iterating > over a file on multiple threads. (Non-crashing) races are still > present. Duplicated, corrupt, and missing data will happen.  I'm not confortable with the idea of data corruption. I'm not confortable with breaking backward compatibility neither. IMHO the key question is if anyone actually use a file object at the same time in multiple threads. Since, it's likely that iterating on the same object crash, I'm not sure that anyone do it.  If someone rely on the feature, we should maybe explain how to handle properly the issue: use a lock.  I have a preference for Serhiy's [PR 3672](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/3672 "GitHub PR 3672: [merged] [3.8] bpo-41889: [Enum] fix multiple-inheritance regression (GH-22487)"). It's simple, the error is easy to understand. Maybe his PR just lacks a mention in "Porting to Python 2.7" section of What's New in Python 2.7 and/or the NEWS entry. Suggest to use a lock for example. ``` | | | |

| ``` Unfortunately, it looks like this fix causes a regression. Some programs rely on being able to seek() and write to a file on multiple threads. For example, py.test captures the standard streams by redirecting them to a tmpfile and then truncating+seeking to 0 after every test. This change broke that situation when multiple threads are logging. Anyway, there's no real fundamental reason to prevent concurrent access, since the underlying stdio implementation is threadsafe. I think we'll have to resurrect my PR. ``` | | | |

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2020

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 334 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [January 2020 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2627487.1).

Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2020verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

# USN-3817-2: Python vulnerabilities

15 November 2018

Several security issues were fixed in Python.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [python2.7](/security/cves?package=python2.7) - An interactive high-level object-oriented language

## Details

USN-3817-1 fixed a vulnerability in Python. This update provides

the corresponding update for Ubuntu 12.04 ESM.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that Python incorrectly handled large amounts of data. A

remote attacker could use this issue to cause Python to crash, resulting in

a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-1000030](/security/CVE-2018-1000030))

It was discovered that Python incorrectly handled running external commands

in the shutil module. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause

Python to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-1000802](/security/CVE-2018-1000802))

It was discovered that Python incorrectly used regular expressions

vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking. A remote attacker could possibly

use this issue to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-1060](/security/CVE-2018-1060), [CVE-2018-1061](/security/CVE-2018-1061))

It was discovered that Python failed to initialize Expat's hash salt. A

remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause hash collisions,

leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-14647](/security/CVE-2018-14647))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [python2.7-minimal](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python2.7)
  -
  [2.7.3-0ubuntu3.11](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python2.7/2.7.3-0ubuntu3.11)
* [python2.7](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python2.7)
  -
  [2.7.3-0ubuntu3.11](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python2.7/2.7.3-0ubuntu3.11)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

It was discovered that Python incorrectly handled running external commands

in the shutil module. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause

Python to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-1000802](/security/CVE-2018-1000802))

It was discovered that Python incorrectly used regular expressions

vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking. A remote attacker could possibly

use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2018-1060](/security/CVE-2018-1060), [CVE-2018-1061](/security/CVE-2018-1061))

It was discovered that Python failed to initialize Expat's hash salt. A

remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause hash collisions,

leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-14647](/security/CVE-2018-14647))

[bpo-31530](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31530): fix crash when multiple threads iterate over a file, round…

```
… 2 ([#5060](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/5060))

Multiple threads iterating over a file can corrupt the file's internal readahead
buffer resulting in crashes. To fix this, cache buffer state thread-locally for
the duration of a file_iternext call and only update the file's internal state
after reading completes.

No attempt is made to define or provide "reasonable" semantics for iterating
over a file on multiple threads. (Non-crashing) races are still
present. Duplicated, corrupt, and missing data will happen.

This was originally fixed by [6401e56](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/6401e5671781eb217ee1afb4603cc0d1b0367ae6), which
raised an exception from seek() and next() when concurrent operations were
detected. Alas, this simpler solution breaks legitimate use cases such as
capturing the standard streams when multiple threads are logging.
