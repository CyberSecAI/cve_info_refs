**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `wrapper` query parameter for the XML variant of the Jenkins remote API did not validate the specified tag name.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of validation of the `wrapper` query parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, information theft, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
A malicious URL containing the vulnerable `wrapper` parameter can be crafted and delivered to a user. If the user clicks the crafted link, the malicious script will be executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to click a malicious link, or otherwise have a way to inject the crafted URL in the victim's browser, but doesn't require prior authentication or access to the server.
