{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Stapler web framework in Jenkins uses reflective access to invoke methods based on naming conventions (e.g., methods starting with 'get' with specific argument types). This allows invocation of unintended methods by crafting specific URLs.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Reflective access vulnerability",
      "Insufficient input validation",
	  "Inadequate permission checks",
	  "Exposure of sensitive information",
	  "Denial of service"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability allows for various attacks, including: \n\t* Invalidating all sessions \n\t* Creation of new user objects \n\t* Triggering of periodic tasks \n\t* Bypassing permission checks \n\t* Accessing build information and logs \n\t* Enumerating and accessing credentials \n\t* Accessing LDAP passwords \n\t* Denial of service",
    "attack_vectors": "Crafted HTTP URLs",
    "required_capabilities": "Varies depending on the specific attack. Some attacks can be performed by unauthenticated users, while others require Overall/Read or other specific permissions."
