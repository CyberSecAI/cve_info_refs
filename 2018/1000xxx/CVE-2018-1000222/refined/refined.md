Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000222:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a double-free error occurring in the `gdImageBmpPtr` function of the libgd library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Double Free:** The primary vulnerability is a double-free condition. This arises when memory allocated for an image is freed more than once.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** The Ubuntu security notice (USN-3755-1) states that an attacker could potentially use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code.
- **Denial of service:** As a consequence of memory corruption or other exploit mechanisms, a denial-of-service (DoS) may also be achieved.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted image, specifically a BMP image as the vulnerability is within `gdImageBmpPtr`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to entice a user or an application to process a malicious BMP image.
- No specific attacker position is stated, meaning this could potentially be triggered remotely.

**Technical Details:**
- The issue is located in the `gdImageBmpPtr` function, which converts a `gdImage` structure to a BMP format and returns a pointer to it.
- The vulnerability occurs because the return value of `gdImageBmpCtx` is not checked and `gdDPExtractData` may cause a double free of the `out` context via `trimDynamic -> gdReallocDynamic`, followed by an explicit `out->gd_free(out)`.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is related to, or similar to, CVE-2017-6362.
- Patches were made available in various distributions including Ubuntu, Debian, and Fedora.

In summary, CVE-2018-1000222 is a double-free vulnerability in the `gdImageBmpPtr` function of libgd that could lead to arbitrary code execution or denial-of-service if a specially crafted BMP image is processed.
