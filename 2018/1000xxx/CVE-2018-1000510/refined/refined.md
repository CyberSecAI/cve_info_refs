- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WP Image Zoom plugin has an AJAX action that allows any logged-in user to set any option to "1". This includes the "template" option, setting which to "1" causes a denial-of-service (DoS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure handling of user-provided input via an AJAX action, allowing arbitrary option values to be set. Lack of proper access control that allows any logged in user to set the option. Also, the vulnerability can be triggered via CSRF.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Setting the "template" option to "1" leads to fatal errors, causing a denial of service for all WordPress URLs.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered via an AJAX request, either directly by a logged-in user or via CSRF, where an attacker tricks a logged-in user into submitting a malicious request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: 
    - For a direct attack, the attacker needs to be a logged-in WordPress user.
    - For a CSRF attack, the attacker needs to convince a logged-in user to follow a malicious link, which would trigger the crafted request.
