Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000415:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Rebuild Plugin failed to properly escape parameter descriptions displayed on the rebuild form page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of proper escaping allowed an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the parameter descriptions. These scripts would be stored and executed when other users viewed the rebuild form.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Script Execution:** An attacker could inject JavaScript that could perform various actions within the context of the victim's browser session.
*   **Potential for Data Theft or Manipulation:** Depending on the injected script, an attacker could potentially steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or alter data visible to the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Configuration of a Job:** An attacker must have the permission to configure jobs in Jenkins. They would then add malicious JavaScript into the description of a job parameter.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim would have to view the rebuild form for the job with the malicious parameter description for the attack to be effective.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Jenkins User Account:** An attacker needs a Jenkins user account with the permission to configure jobs.
*   **Knowledge of Jenkins Configuration:** The attacker needs to be able to configure a job and parameter descriptions.

**Additional Notes:**
