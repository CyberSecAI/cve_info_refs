Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000426:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Git Changelog Plugin did not properly sanitize Git commit messages before displaying them on the Jenkins UI. Specifically, it failed to escape HTML characters, which could be exploited to inject malicious JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser when they view a job's changelog page in Jenkins. This could lead to a variety of malicious actions, including:
    - Session hijacking.
    - Stealing sensitive information.
    - Modifying the user interface.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker would need to inject malicious JavaScript into a Git commit message that is then processed and displayed by the Git Changelog plugin on Jenkins.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs commit access to a Git repository that is being used by a Jenkins job which uses the Git Changelog Plugin.
- The attacker needs to craft a Git commit message containing malicious JavaScript code.
- The victim needs to view the affected Jenkins job changelog page for the exploit to be triggered.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affected versions of the Git Changelog plugin up to and including 2.6.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.7 of the plugin, which now escapes Git commit messages.
- This vulnerability was identified as SECURITY-1122 in the Jenkins security advisory.
