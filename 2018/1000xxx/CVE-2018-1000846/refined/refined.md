Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000846:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the FreshDNS application. This means that a malicious attacker could craft requests that, when unknowingly executed by a logged-in user, would perform unwanted actions on their behalf within the FreshDNS application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF vulnerability:** The application was not checking for a valid token or origin to verify that the incoming request was intentionally submitted by the user on the application itself. This allows an attacker to create a request to perform any privileged action on the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially delete all DNS zones associated with the victim's account, leading to significant service disruption.
- **Other Actions:** Depending on the FreshDNS application's capabilities, other destructive or unwanted actions could be triggered, like changing user settings, deleting records, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Website/Email:** An attacker could embed malicious code into a website or email that the victim would load while logged into FreshDNS.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker may need to socially engineer the victim into visiting a malicious website or clicking on a malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Basic Web Development Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to write HTML and Javascript to construct the malicious request.
- **Victim Awareness:** The attacker must be aware of the target user using the FreshDNS application, and must be able to get the victim to load the malicious content while they're logged into the application.
- **No access to FreshDNS application backend:** The attacker doesn't require access to the server, or any internal resources, to carry out the attack.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content includes a pull request that aims to fix the CSRF vulnerability by implementing an XSRF token check on all POST requests, thus preventing an attacker from forging these requests.
- The patch introduces a check in the `class.login.php` file that verifies the presence and validity of the `xsrf_token`. Also, the token is added to javascript and included in all the POST requests through `freshdns.js`. Finally, the token is included in the header file.
