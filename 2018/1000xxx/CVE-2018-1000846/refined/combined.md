# XSRF vulnerability #7

## Description

[![@luelista](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/388142?u=702ab9350bdee3fd8ca0879f370a867267d7b0a6&v=4&size=48)](/luelista)[luelista](https://github.com/luelista)opened [on Nov 7, 2018](https://github.com/funzoneq/freshdns/issues/7#issue-378404822)

I noticed that FreshDNS is vulnerable to [Cross-Site Request Forgery](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%28CSRF%29), allowing an attacker to e.g. delete all zones on your server if they can get you to load a website containing their javascript while you're logged in to FreshDNS in the same browser.

It is fixed (hopefully) in my merge request [#6](https://github.com/funzoneq/freshdns/pull/6)
