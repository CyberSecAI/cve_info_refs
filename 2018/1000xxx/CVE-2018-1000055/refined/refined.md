Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000055:

**CVE Description:**
The provided content describes CVE-2018-1000055 as an XML External Entity (XXE) processing vulnerability affecting the Android Lint plugin. This vulnerability is a result of the plugin using the Static Analysis Utilities plugin, which was susceptible to XXE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper handling of XML parsing in the Android Lint plugin (and other plugins using Static Analysis Utilities). The plugin was vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection because it did not disable external entity resolution when processing XML files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **XXE Vulnerability:** The primary vulnerability is an XXE injection. This occurs when a plugin parses untrusted XML data that contains references to external entities. These entities can be used to:
    - Extract secrets from the Jenkins controller.
    - Perform server-side request forgery (SSRF).
    - Launch denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
    - **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker can potentially read sensitive files from the Jenkins controller, including credentials or configuration details.
    - **SSRF:** An attacker can make the Jenkins controller initiate requests to internal or external resources, potentially compromising other systems.
    - **Denial of Service:** An attacker can force the Jenkins controller to process large amounts of data or exhaust resources, causing a DoS.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by:
    - Configuring a Jenkins build process to use the vulnerable plugin.
    - Providing a maliciously crafted XML file as input to the plugin. This XML file would contain external entity references that point to the attacker's desired target (e.g., local files, external servers).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to have the ability to configure a build process within the Jenkins environment to use the affected plugin. This typically requires having the "Job/Configure" permission.
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious XML file during the build.

**Additional Notes:**

* This vulnerability is present in multiple plugins that rely on the Static Analysis Utilities plugin.
* The fix involves disabling external entity resolution for affected plugins.
* The provided information includes a CVSS score for this vulnerability:
    - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L (High Severity)

*   The specific affected versions are:
    *   **android-lint Plugin:** up to and including 2.5
    *  The fix for android-lint is to update to version 2.6
