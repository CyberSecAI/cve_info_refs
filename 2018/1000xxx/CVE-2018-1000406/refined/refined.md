- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of relative paths in file parameter definitions when archiving uploaded files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Arbitrary file write vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can write files to arbitrary locations on the Jenkins controller by specifying a relative path that escapes the base directory in the file parameter definition. This allows for arbitrary file write which can lead to remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Users with Job/Configure permission can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious file parameter definition.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have Job/Configure permission in order to modify a job and add the malicious file parameter.
