# UrlTrigger Plugin

URLTrigger plug-in makes it possible to monitor changes of the response got from an URL invocation.

## Features

Jenkins can be configured to poll URL changes.
 The plug-in makes it possible to check the last modification date response and the response content of a URL invocation.
 For the response content, you can check:

* a simple response content (the content nature is not interpreted; a MD5 is used)
* a TXT response content (the returned values from the evaluation of regular expressions are checked)
* an XML response content (the returned values from the evaluation of XPath expressions are checked)
* a JSON response content (the returned values from the evaluation of JSONPath expressions are checked)

# Some Use cases

* Enables users to check if new artifacts (such as binaries) have been deployed in a repository (managed for example by a repository manager such as Sonatype Nexus, JFrog Artifactory, Apache Archiva and so on).
* Know if a stage of a pipeline (for a continuous testing, a continous delivery or a continuous deployment) has to be executed.

# Known Limitations

Only http(s) and ftp URLs are supported. For non-http protocols, consider other XTrigger plugins such as the [FSTrigger Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/fstrigger/)

This plugin integrates Jenkins with [GitHub](http://github.com/) projects.The plugin currently has three major functionalities:

* Create hyperlinks between your Jenkins projects and GitHub
* Trigger a job when you push to the repository by groking HTTP POSTs from post-receive hook and optionally auto-managing the hook setup.
* Report build status result back to github as [Commit Status](https://github.com/blog/1227-commit-status-api) ([documented on SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14274293/show-current-state-of-jenkins-build-on-github-repo/26910986#26910986))
* Base features for other plugins

## Hyperlinks between changes

The GitHub plugin decorates Jenkins "Changes" pages to create links to your GitHub commit and issue pages. It adds a sidebar link that links back to the GitHub project page.

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/github-plugin@master/docs/images/changes.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/github-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/changes.png) [![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/github-plugin@master/docs/images/changes-2.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/github-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/changes-2.png)

When creating a job, specify that is connects to git. Under "GitHub project", put in: [git@github.com](https://github.com/jenkinsci/github-plugin/blob/master/mailto%3Agit%40github.com):*Person*/*Project*.git Under "Source Code Management" select Git, and put in [git@github.com](https://github.com/jenkinsci/github-plugin/blob/master/mailto%3Agit%40github.com):*Person*/*Project*.git

## GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling

This feature enables builds after [post-receive hooks in your GitHub repositories](https://help.github.com/post-receive-hooks/). This trigger only kicks git-plugin internal polling algo for every incoming event against matched repo.

> This trigger was previously named as "Build when a change is pushed to GitHub"

## Usage

To be able to use this feature different mode are available :

* manual mode : the url have to be added manually in each project
* automatic mode : Jenkins register automatically the webhook for every project

### Manual Mode

In this mode, you'll be responsible for registering the hook URLs to GitHub. Click the [![(question)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/github-plugin@master/docs/images/help_16.svg)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/github-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/help_16.svg) icon (under Manage Jenkins > Configure System > GitHub) to see the URL in Jenkins that receives the post-commit POSTs — but in general the URL is of the form `$JENKINS_BASE_URL/github-webhook/` — for example: `https://ci.example.com/jenkins/github-webhook/`.

Once you have the URL, and have added it as a webhook to the relevant GitHub repositories, continue to **Step 3**.

### Automatic Mode (Jenkins manages hooks for jobs by itself)

In this mode, Jenkins will automatically add/remove hook URLs to GitHub based on the project configuration in the background. You'll specify GitHub OAuth token so that Jenkins can login as you to do this.

**Step 1.** Go to the global configuration and add GitHub Server Config.

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/github-plugin@master/docs/images/ghserver-config.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/github-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/ghserver-config.png)

**Step 2.1.** Create your personal access token in GitHub.

Plugin can help you to do it with all required scopes. Go to **Advanced** -> **Manage Additional GitHub Actions** -> **Convert Login and Password to token**

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/github-plugin@master/docs/images/manage-token.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/github-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/manage-token.png)

> *Two-Factor Authentication*
>
> Auto-creating token doesn't work with [GitHub 2FA](https://help.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication/)
>
> You can create **"Secret text"** credentials with token in corresponding domain with login and password directly, or from username and password credentials.

**Step 2.2.** Select previously created "Secret Text" credentials with GitHub OAuth token.

*Required scopes for token*

To be able manage hooks your token should have **admin:org\_hook** scope.

*GitHub Enterprise*

You can also redefine GitHub url by clicking on **Custom GitHub API URL** checkbox.
 Note that credentials are filtered by entered GH url with help of domain requirements. So you can create credentials in different domains and see only credentials that matched by predefined domains.

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/github-plugin@master/docs/images/secret-text.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/github-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/secret-text.png)

**Step 3.** Once that configuration is done, go to the project config of each job you want triggered automatically and simply check "GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling" under "Build Triggers". With this, every new push to the repository automatically triggers a new build.

Note that there's only one URL and it receives all post-receive POSTs for all your repositories. The server side of this URL is smart enough to figure out which projects need to be triggered, based on the submission.

## Security Implications

This plugin requires that you have an HTTP URL reachable from GitHub, which means it's reachable from the whole internet. So it is implemented carefully with the possible malicious fake post-receive POSTS in mind. To cope with this, upon receiving a POST, Jenkins will talk to GitHub to ensure the push was actually made.

## Jenkins inside a firewall

In case your Jenkins run inside the firewall and not directly reachable from the internet, this plugin lets you specify an arbitrary endpoint URL as an override in the automatic mode. The plugin will assume that you've set up reverse proxy or some other means so that the POST from GitHub will be routed to the Jenkins.

## Trouble-shooting hooks

If you set this up but build aren't triggered, check the following things:

* Click the "admin" button on the GitHub repository in question and make sure post-receive hooks are there.
  + If it's not there, make sure you have proper credential set in the Jenkins system config page.
* Also, [enable logging](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Logging) for the class names
  + `com.cloudbees.jenkins.GitHubPushTrigger`
  + `org.jenkinsci.plugins.github.webhook.WebhookManager`
  + `com.cloudbees.jenkins.GitHubWebHook`
     and you'll see the log of Jenkins trying to install a post-receive hook.
* Click "Test hook" button from the GitHub UI and see if Jenkins receive a payload.

## Using cache to GitHub requests

Each **GitHub Server Config** creates own GitHub client to interact with api. By default it uses cache (with **20MB** limit) to speedup process of fetching data and reduce rate-limit consuming. You can change cache limit value in "Advanced" section of this config item. If you set 0, then this feature will be disabled for this (and only this) config.

Additional info:

* This plugin now serves only hooks from github as main feature. Then it starts using git-plugin to fetch sources.
* It works both public and Enterprise GitHub
* Plugin have some [limitations](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16323749/jenkins-github-plugin-inverse-branches)

## Possible Issues between Jenkins and GitHub

### Windows:

* In windows, Jenkins will use the the SSH key of the user it is running as, which is located in the %USERPROFILE%\.ssh folder ( on XP, that would be C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\.ssh, and on 7 it would be C:\Users\USERNAME\.ssh). Therefore, you need to force Jenkins to run as the user that has the SSH key configured. To do that, right click on My Computer, and hit "Manage". Click on "Services". Go to Jenkins, right click, and select  "Properties". Under the "Log On" tab, choose the user Jenkins will run as, and put in the username and password (it requires one). Then restart the Jenkins service by right clicking on Jenkins (in the services window), and hit "Restart".
* Jenkins does not support passphrases for SSH keys. Therefore, if you set one while running the initial GitHub configuration, rerun it and don't set one.

## Pipeline examples

### Setting commit status

This code will set commit status for custom repo with configured context and message (you can also define same way backref)

```
void setBuildStatus(String message, String state) {
  step([
      $class: "GitHubCommitStatusSetter",
      reposSource: [$class: "ManuallyEnteredRepositorySource", url: "https://github.com/my-org/my-repo"],
      contextSource: [$class: "ManuallyEnteredCommitContextSource", context: "ci/jenkins/build-status"],
      errorHandlers: [[$class: "ChangingBuildStatusErrorHandler", result: "UNSTABLE"]],
      statusResultSource: [ $class: "ConditionalStatusResultSource", results: [[$class: "AnyBuildResult", message: message, state: state]] ]
  ]);
}

setBuildStatus("Build complete", "SUCCESS");
```

More complex example (can be used with multiple scm sources in pipeline)

```
def getRepoURL() {
  sh "git config --get remote.origin.url > .git/remote-url"
  return readFile(".git/remote-url").trim()
}

def getCommitSha() {
  sh "git rev-parse HEAD > .git/current-commit"
  return readFile(".git/current-commit").trim()
}

def updateGithubCommitStatus(build) {
  // workaround https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-38674
  repoUrl = getRepoURL()
  commitSha = getCommitSha()

  step([
    $class: 'GitHubCommitStatusSetter',
    reposSource: [$class: "ManuallyEnteredRepositorySource", url: repoUrl],
    commitShaSource: [$class: "ManuallyEnteredShaSource", sha: commitSha],
    errorHandlers: [[$class: 'ShallowAnyErrorHandler']],
    statusResultSource: [
      $class: 'ConditionalStatusResultSource',
      results: [
        [$class: 'BetterThanOrEqualBuildResult', result: 'SUCCESS', state: 'SUCCESS', message: build.description],
        [$class: 'BetterThanOrEqualBuildResult', result: 'FAILURE', state: 'FAILURE', message: build.description],
        [$class: 'AnyBuildResult', state: 'FAILURE', message: 'Loophole']
      ]
    ]
  ])
}
```

## Descriptions

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in GitHub Plugin allowed capturing credentials

**SECURITY-915
/
CVE-2018-1000600**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`github`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/github)**

**Description:**

A form action method in GitHub Plugin did not check the permission of the user accessing it, allowing anyone with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to cause Jenkins to send a GitHub API request to create an API token to an attacker-specified URL.

This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

The form validation method now requires POST requests and the Overall/Administer permission.

### Arbitrary file read vulnerability in SSH Credentials Plugin with Credentials Binding Plugin

**SECURITY-440
/
CVE-2018-1000601**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ssh-credentials`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ssh-credentials)**

**Description:**

SSH Credentials Plugin allowed the creation of SSH credentials with keys "From a file on Jenkins controller".
Credentials Binding Plugin 1.13 and newer allows binding SSH credentials to environment variables.
In combination, these two features allow users with the permission to configure a job to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller by creating an SSH credential referencing an arbitrary file on the Jenkins controller, and binding it to an environment variable in a job.

SSH Credentials Plugin no longer supports SSH credentials from files on the Jenkins controller file system, neither user-specified file paths nor `~/.ssh`.
Existing SSH credentials of these kinds are migrated to "directly entered" SSH credentials.

|  | If [Blue Ocean](https://plugins.jenkins.io/blueocean) is installed, it needs to be updated to 1.5.1 or 1.6.1, or the creation of pipelines for plain Git will not work anymore after installing the fix for this issue. |
| --- | --- |

### HTTP session fixation vulnerability in SAML Plugin

**SECURITY-916
/
CVE-2018-1000602**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Openstack Cloud Plugin allowed capturing credentials

**SECURITY-808
/
CVE-2018-1000603**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`openstack-cloud`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/openstack-cloud)**

**Description:**

Openstack Cloud Plugin did not perform permission checks on methods implementing form validation.
This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins, and to cause Jenkins to submit HTTP requests to attacker-specified URLs.

Additionally, these form validation methods did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

These form validation methods now require POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions.

### AWS CodeDeploy Plugin persisted possibly sensitive environment variables in job configuration

**SECURITY-825
/
CVE-2018-1000402**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`codedeploy`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/codedeploy)**

**Description:**

AWS CodeDeploy Plugin could persist environment variables from the last run of any project with the post-build step configured in the job’s `config.xml` file.

In some cases, this allowed users with file system access or Extended Read permission to obtain those potentially sensitive environment variables by accessing the project’s `config.xml`.

AWS CodeDeploy Plugin 1.20 and newer no longer stores build environment variables on disk.
Existing job `config.xml` will retain the stored environment variables until the job configuration is saved again.

### AWS CodeDeploy Plugin stored AWS Secret Key in plain text

**SECURITY-833
/
CVE-2018-1000403**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`codedeploy`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/codedeploy)**

**Description:**

### CollabNet Plugin globally and unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation

**SECURITY-941
/
CVE-2018-1000605**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`collabnet`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/collabnet)**

**Description:**

CollabNet Plugin disabled SSL/TLS certificate validation for the entire Jenkins controller JVM by default.

CollabNet Plugin 2.0.5 and newer no longer does that.
It instead requires users to opt in to disabling SSL/TLS certificate validation by setting the system property `hudson.plugins.collabnet.CollabNetPlugin.skipSslValidation` to `true`.
This feature applies to connections by this plugin only.

### Server-side request forgery vulnerability in URLTrigger Plugin

**SECURITY-819
