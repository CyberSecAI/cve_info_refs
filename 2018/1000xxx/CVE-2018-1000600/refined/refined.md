Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-1000600:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The GitHub Plugin had a form action method that lacked proper permission checks. Additionally, this method did not enforce the use of POST requests, leading to a CSRF vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing Permission Checks:** The form action method could be accessed by anyone with Overall/Read access, not requiring administrative privileges for the sensitive action.
*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The form action method did not require POST requests, allowing an attacker to trigger the request through a crafted URL.
*   **Exposure of Credentials:** The vulnerability allowed an attacker to initiate a GitHub API request that creates an API token to an attacker-specified URL, using attacker specified credentials IDs. This allowed an attacker to potentially capture credentials stored in Jenkins by redirecting the creation of these credentials to the attackers server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker could capture credentials stored in Jenkins by causing Jenkins to send a GitHub API request to an attacker-specified URL.
*   The attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to resources protected by the captured credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   An attacker would need Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
*   The attacker would need to craft a malicious request to trigger the vulnerable form action method, to an attacker controlled endpoint.
*   The attacker would need to obtain the credentials ID from Jenkins.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have at least Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests.
*   The attacker needs a method to obtain existing credential IDs from the Jenkins instance.

**Additional Notes:**
The provided information also indicates that the vulnerability was fixed by:
*   Requiring POST requests for the form action method
*   Enforcing the Overall/Administer permission for the form action method.
