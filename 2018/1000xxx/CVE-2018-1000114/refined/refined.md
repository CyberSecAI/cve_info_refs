Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2018-1000114:

**CVE-2018-1000114**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The Promoted Builds Plugin lacked proper permission checks for manual promotion conditions, specifically when a list of allowed users was not specified.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    *   **Improper Access Control**: Users with Job/Read permission could approve and re-execute promotion processes with manual conditions that didn't specify a list of allowed users, which they should not have been able to do.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**: Unauthorized users with Job/Read permission could trigger promotion processes, potentially leading to unintended consequences, such as deploying a different version of code or running tests.
*   **Attack Vectors**: Network access to Jenkins web interface.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: An attacker would need to have a valid user account with Job/Read permissions.

**Summary of Changes After Fix**:
    *   Users now require the Promotion/Promote permission to approve or re-execute a promotion with a manual condition that does not specify a list of allowed approvers.
    *   Users with only Promotion/Promote permission cannot re-execute or force promotions with a manual condition that specifies a list of users unless they are on that list.
    *   Administrators can now approve any promotion with a manual condition.
    *   Users specified in a manual promotion condition are allowed to force the promotion.
