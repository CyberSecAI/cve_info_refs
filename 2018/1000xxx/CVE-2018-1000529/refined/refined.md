  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2018-1000529",
    "description": "The Grails Fields Plugin version 2.2.7 and earlier has a Stored XSS vulnerability. A malicious user is able to store JavaScript code into a domain object displayed by tags of the Grails Fields plugin, which is not encoded or validated and will be executed by the browser. This can lead to account takeover or other malicious activities. The vulnerability is present in all projects using Grails v3.3.5 and below since they all include the affected Grails Fields plugin v2.2.7 and below. It was fixed in the Grails Fields plugin v2.2.8, which is being used in Grails v3.3.6. All projects using Grails v3.3.5 or lower are recommended to upgrade to at least v3.3.6 or to define the version of the Grails Fields plugin dependency in build.gradle to be v2.2.8 or higher.",
    "root_cause": "The Grails Fields plugin does not encode or validate HTML or JavaScript code within domain objects displayed by its tags, leading to Stored XSS.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session, potentially leading to account takeover, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious user stores JavaScript code in a domain object displayed by tags of the Grails Fields plugin, which is not encoded or validated."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to modify data in domain objects that are displayed by the vulnerable Grails Fields plugin. This can be achieved either through direct manipulation in the database or by exploiting user input fields in the application's UI.",
