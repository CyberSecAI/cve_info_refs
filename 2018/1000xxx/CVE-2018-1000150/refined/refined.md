Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000150:

**CVE-2018-1000150:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Reverse Proxy Auth Plugin was persisting a cache of granted authorities (group memberships) on disk.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin stored sensitive user group membership information on the Jenkins controller's file system without proper protection.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with local file system access to the Jenkins controller could obtain group membership information of Jenkins users. This could potentially be used for privilege escalation or to gain more understanding of the system's access controls.
*   **Attack vectors:** Local file system access to the Jenkins controller.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to the Jenkins controller's file system, which usually implies some level of system access or compromised account on the machine running the Jenkins controller.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is considered to have a "low" severity.
*   The issue was addressed in Reverse Proxy Auth Plugin version 1.6.0, which no longer stores the cache on disk.
