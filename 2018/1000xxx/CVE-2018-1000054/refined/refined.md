The provided content contains information about CVE-2018-1000054, which is related to an XML External Entity (XXE) processing vulnerability in multiple Jenkins plugins based on the Static Analysis Utilities plugin, including the CCM plugin.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an XML External Entity (XXE) processing issue present in plugins based on the Static Analysis Utilities plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XXE Vulnerability:** The plugins were vulnerable to XXE attacks due to improper handling of external entities during XML parsing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially extract secrets from the Jenkins controller by leveraging the XXE vulnerability.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The vulnerability could be used to perform SSRF attacks, potentially accessing internal network resources.
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** Exploitation could lead to DoS attacks by causing the server to exhaust resources due to the processing of malicious XML payloads.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could configure build processes to parse a maliciously crafted XML file that leverages external entities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to configure build processes within the Jenkins environment. This likely requires at least the `Job/Configure` permission.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is addressed by disabling external entity resolution in the affected plugins.
- The specific CVE IDs related to this vulnerability are:
    - **CVE-2018-1000054 (SECURITY-659):** Affects the CCM plugin.
    - **CVE-2018-1000055 (SECURITY-660):** Affects the Android Lint plugin.
- The affected plugins versions need to be updated to the fixed version to remediate the vulnerability
- The Pipeline: Supporting APIs plugin also has a separate security issue (CVE-2018-1000058) related to arbitrary code execution, but this is not related to CVE-2018-1000054
