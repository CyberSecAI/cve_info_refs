Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000073:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a directory traversal issue in the `install_location` function of `package.rb` within RubyGems. This allows writing to a symlinked base directory outside of the intended root.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Directory traversal:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to traverse directories by exploiting how symlinked base directories are handled during gem installation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary file write:** An attacker can write files to locations outside the intended installation directory, potentially overwriting system files or injecting malicious code in unexpected locations.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Gem installation:** The attack vector is the gem installation process itself. A malicious gem, when installed, can trigger this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Malicious gem creation:** An attacker would need to create a specially crafted gem file that exploits the path traversal vulnerability.
- **User interaction:** The user would need to install the crafted malicious gem.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in RubyGems version 2.7.6.
- The fix involves sanitizing pathnames and preventing writing to locations outside the intended root directory during gem installation.
- Various distributions, such as Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat, and openSUSE, have released updates to address this vulnerability.
