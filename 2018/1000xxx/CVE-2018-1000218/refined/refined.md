Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000218:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by a lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in the `interface/fax/fax_view.php` file. Specifically, the `file` and `scan` parameters within the URL are not properly sanitized before being used in the application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS).
*   The `fax_view.php` script directly uses the `file` and `scan` parameters from the URL without proper validation or encoding.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the application
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Data theft
    *   Other malicious activities

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through crafted URLs. An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing the malicious JavaScript payload within the `file` or `scan` parameters.
*   The victim needs to access the malicious crafted URL via their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker does not require any special permissions or privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and convince a victim to click it.
*   The target user must be a user of the OpenEMR application.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability is in the following lines:
```php
} else if ($_GET['scan']) {
 $ffname = $GLOBALS['scanner_output_directory'] . '/' . $_GET['scan'];
} else {
 $ffname = $GLOBALS['hylafax_basedir'] . '/recvq/' . $_GET['file'];
}
```

The variables `$_GET['scan']` and `$_GET['file']` are directly used to create a file path without sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject a malicious payload such as `<svg/onload=alert(1)>` via the URL, which will be rendered by the browser due to lack of proper sanitization on the server side.
