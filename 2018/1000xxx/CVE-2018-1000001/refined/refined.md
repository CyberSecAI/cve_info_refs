        "text": "Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is caused by a Linux kernel behavior change in the syscall API (returning relative pathnames in getcwd()) and non-defensive function implementation in libc (failing to process that pathname correctly). Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The vulnerability is a buffer underflow in the glibc realpath() function when getcwd() returns a relative path or an unreachable path that does not start with '/'. This happens because realpath() assumes getcwd() will always return an absolute path and does not perform boundary checks. Impact of exploitation: This vulnerability can be used to gain root privileges via SUID binaries on affected systems. Attack vectors: The attack vector involves exploiting the realpath() function, which is used by various SUID binaries to resolve pathnames. The attacker can control the path to be resolved with a crafted symbolic link, which includes '../' sequences, and an environment with a mount namespace that causes getcwd() to return a relative path. Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to create new mount namespaces or access processes in mount namespaces returning relative paths from getcwd(). They also need to have control over the paths processed by realpath(), typically via arguments to SUID binaries such as mount or umount. The vulnerability is also affected by enabled unprivileged user namespaces."
