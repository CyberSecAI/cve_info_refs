| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1564408#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2018-04-06 08:02:43 UTC  ```  Spring Framework provides client-side support for multipart requests. When Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux server application (server A) receives input from a remote client, and then uses that input to make a multipart request to another server (server B), it can be exposed to an attack, where an extra multipart is inserted in the content of the request from server A, causing server B to use the wrong value for a part it expects. This could to lead privilege escalation, for example, if the part content represents a username or user roles.  In order for the attacker to succeed, they would have to be able to guess the multipart boundary value chosen by server A for the multipart request to server B, which requires the attacker to also have control of the server or the ability to see the HTTP log of server A through a separate attack vector.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

**Jolokia** is remote JMX with JSON over HTTP.

It is fast, simple, polyglot and has unique features. It's JMX on [Capsaicin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin).

Jolokia is a JMX-HTTP bridge giving an alternative to JSR-160 connectors. It is an agent based approach with support for many platforms. In addition to basic JMX operations it enhances JMX remoting with unique features like bulk requests and fine grained security policies.

### Starting points

* Overview of [features](features.html) which make Jolokia unique for JMX remoting.
* The [documentation](documentation.html) includes a [tutorial](tutorial.html) and a [reference manual](reference/html/manual/index.html).
* [Agents](agent.html) exist for many platforms (Jakarta EE, OSGi, JVM).
* [Support](support.html) is available through GitHub.
* [Contributions](support.html#Source) are highly appreciated, too.

## News

### Jolokia 2.2.1 released

2025-01-23

We’re happy to release Jolokia 2.2.1! This is new minor release, as the scope of changes is a bit too wide for just 2.1.3 release.

In this release we’ve reviewed support for IPv6 in every place where IP addresses are used - UDP Multicast based discovery, policy restrictor for source IP addresses and URL usage. Jolokia now works properly with UDP/IP6 discovery using an option like `multicastGroup=ff08::48:84,multicastPort=24884` (the default is still `239.192.48.84`).

Spring Boot dependency of `jolokia-support-spring` module has been changed to 3.4.1, but that’s only declared dependency. Jolokia works well with all Spring Boot 3 versions.

One of the requested features was restarting Jolokia HTTP server when a change in configured TLS certificates was detected - this is especially important in Kubernetes/OpenShift deployments where the environment may use aggressive certificate refresh policy. Now there’s no need to restart entire pod when `useCertificateReload` is set to a given number of seconds. It defaults to `-1` to keep backward compatibility.

And the biggest change is improved configuration management. All options can use property placeholders like:

* `${sys:configurationOption}` (or `${prop:configurationOption}`) to reference system properties
* `${env:VARIABLE_NAME}` to reference environment variables
* `${ip}`, `${ip6}`, `${host}`, `${ip:<interface>}` (e.g., `${ip:eth0}`) to reference networking configuration

Also, similarly to [Spring Boot configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/external-config.html), Jolokia looks up configuration options in different sources/locations (in order of increasing priority - later sources override previous ones):

1. defaults from the code
2. defaults from `default-jolokia-agent.properties` resource of JVM Agent
3. options from file specified by `config` option of JVM Agent
4. environment variables with `JOLOKIA_` prefix
5. system properties with `jolokia.` prefix
6. servlet config parameters
7. servlet context parameters
8. remaining options of JVM Agent (command line)

With this release, current version of `jolokia.js` npm package is 2.2.1 - even if it doesn’t bring any changes.

What happened to version 2.2.0? Just after release [Klaus Dorninger](https://github.com/dornimaug) found a problem with IPv4 only deployments (thanks for quick check!). So we needed 2.2.1…​

Refer to [changelog](https://jolokia.org/changes-report.html#a2.2.1) for detailed information about the release.

### Jolokia 2.1.2 released

2024-11-13

Jolokia 2.1.2 is released and it is ready for more generic integration with other runtimes, especially with [Apache Artemis](https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/).

Long existing `ServerDetector` abstraction was enhanced to let Jolokia know about actual ClassLoader used within given runtime. For example, [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/) starts with just few JARs on system CLASSPATH and later the *actual* ClassLoader is constructed using JARs from `${catalina.home}/lib`. Now Jolokia running as JVM agent has proper access to classes from this broader ClassLoader.

Additionally we’ve provided a little diagnostic check to detect (usually incorrect) setup when Jolokia is running twice in single JVM (for example as WAR and JVM agent).

With this release, current version of `jolokia.js` npm package is 2.1.8.

Refer to [changelog](https://jolokia.org/changes-report.html#a2.1.2) for detailed information about the release.

### Jolokia 2.1.1 released

2024-09-12

Jolokia 2.1.1 is released with adjustments to TypeScript type definitions and few improvements to new JavaScript ESM client.
With this release, current version of `jolokia.js` npm package is 2.1.7.

### Jolokia 2.1.0 released

2024-08-12

We’re happy to announce a new minor release of Jolokia! Minor releases introduce new features and may require a few adjustments to client code. But no worries - the client code needs some adjustments *only* for the new Jolokia JavaScript library!

#### New JavaScript libraries

After nine (!) years since the introduction of [ES6 modules](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/08/es6-in-depth-modules/) into JavaScript language, we’ve finally moved JavaScript code from manually created UMD-structured JavaScript files (see [IIFE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function#using_an_immediately_invoked_function_expression_iife), [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd), [The Evolution of JavaScript Modularity](https://github.com/myshov/history-of-javascript/tree/master/4_evolution_of_js_modularity)).

Because nowadays JavaScript "scripts" are consumed using packages, Jolokia provides a new Maven module (`org.jolokia:jolokia-client-javascript-esm`) that contains modern JS packages:

* `jolokia.js`— While this package is already present in <https://www.npmjs.com/package/jolokia.js>, it now contains different targets—a proper ES module and ready-to-use files produced by [Rollup JS bundler](https://rollupjs.org/).
* `@jolokia.js/simple` - this package replaces `jolokia-simple.js` file which was part of initial NPM package.

What’s more, the new JavaScript library is developed using the [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) language without affecting end-user experience. We now have the full definition of the types used by Jolokia, which has already proved to be very useful in finding miscellaneous problems hidden in type-less JavaScript code.

#### Fetch API

Since Jolokia was created, [JQuery Ajax](https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/) performed HTTP calls from JavaScript code.

Instead of relying on external dependency, we use [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API), which is now standard in all modern, secure browsers.

This makes the Jolokia JavaScript library independent of any external dependency. It also makes the code aware of the async/await programming model and [Promises API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises). See the dedicated chapter in the [reference documentation](reference/html/manual/clients.html#client-javascript).

#### New JSON parser

Since [first available GitHub commit](https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/commit/4d7a089e97576836945983ecfbbc92ae818b50ac), Jolokia was using `com.googlecode.json-simple:json-simple` JSON parser/serializer library. This library has quite an interesting history (moving from [code.google.com](https://code.google.com/archive/p/json-simple/) to GitHub, forking, …​). It does its job very well, but we’ve decided to make a bold move and remove this dependency without adding a new external JSON dependency.

Here’s what we did - we used [JSON grammar used by `json-simple`](https://github.com/fangyidong/json-simple/blob/tag_release_1_1_1/doc/json.lex), checked the [changes made in forked version](https://github.com/cliftonlabs/json-simple/blob/json-simple-4.0.1/src/main/lex/jsonstrict.lex) and used [JFlex](https://www.jflex.de/) to generate Jolokia own lexer.

With a working lexer, we’ve built our flexible parser/serializer to fulfill Jolokia’s needs. And yes, we’ve made it ~2x faster (in non-exhaustive tests involving [Artemis broker](https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/) running with 10,000 queues).

The new Jolokia module is `org.jolokia:jolokia-json` and it fully replaces `com.googlecode.json-simple:json-simple` library. Class names are the same, the only change is in the package name (switch from `org.json.simple` to `org.jolokia.json`).

#### New Jolokia protocol version

Going with the flow, after moving from JavaScript to TypeScript and getting our own JSON parser, we’ve introduced a new Jolokia protocol version, `8.0`. There’s more information in the [relevant documentation section](reference/html/manual/jolokia_protocol.html#optimized-response-list), but here’s a summary of the changes:

* With the new `listKeys` processing/request parameter, `list()` operation returns an additional `"keys"` field for MBean’s MBeanInfo - it contains a map of the keys obtained from ObjectName
* With the new `includeRequest` processing/request parameter, we can tell Jolokia not to return incoming requests under the `"request"` field of the response (defaults to `true`)
* The `list()` operation may be optimized with the new `listCache` processing/request parameter. It allows caching the common JSON-ified MBeanInfo to avoid duplicating it in the `list()` response for, say, 50,000 Artemis queue MBeans. Getting 2MB instead of 0.5GB of JSON is always a good thing. More details can be found in the documentation.

#### New extension points

To make `list()` operation more flexible (based on experience gained from the [Hawtio console](https://hawt.io/)), Jolokia now provides extension points for `list()`. While it is still based on `javax.management.MBeanServerConnection.queryMBeans()` call, we don’t necessarily blindly serialize each MBean’s `javax.management.MBeanInfo`.

In detail, Jolokia offers these new extension hooks:

* With the `org.jolokia.service.jmx.api.CacheKeyProvider` Jolokia service, we can ask third-party libraries whether a given MBean can be translated into a *cache key*. If many MBeans can be translated into a single cache key, we can optimize the `list()` response by caching common MBeanInfo.
* with the `org.jolokia.service.jmx.handler.list.DataUpdater` Jolokia service, we can get additional information inside JSON-ified `javax.management.MBeanInfo` - 3rd party extensions may add RBAC information or any other data into the MBeanInfo

#### Old issues resolved

It’s worth noting that we’ve also fixed issues dating back up to 2015…​

* Added support for custom date format for dates (and new `java.time` classes)
* Added support for multi-dimensional arrays
* Added support for `java.util.Date` operation parameters
* Added ability to declare (in `jolokia-access.xml`) that some MBeans simply should not be returned in `search` and `list` operations.

Please refer to [changelog](https://jolokia.org/changes-report.html#a2.1.0) for detailed information about the release.

### Jolokia 2.0.3 released

2024-06-06

Jolokia 2.0.3 is released with 3 minor fixes. Certificate chains are handled better (thanks [Shay Elkin](https://github.com/shayelkin)!) and we know allow to configure how `long` values are handled during JSON serialization.

Refer to [changelog](https://jolokia.org/changes-report.html#a2.0.3) for detailed information about the release.

### Jolokia 2.0.2 released

2024-03-07

Spring time is approaching and we’ve skimmed through some old issues to clean them up. Jolokia 2.0.2 is released with few minor fixes. Most notably, write-only JMX attributes are now handled correctly and heuristic Jolokia shutdown thread is replaced with proper [JVM shutdown hook](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Runtime.html#addShutdownHook(java.lang.Thread)).

We’ve also ensured that all tests pass on IBM versions of JDK.

Refer to [changelog](https://jolokia.org/changes-report.html#a2.0.2) for detailed information about the release.

### Jolokia 2.0.1 released

2024-01-26

Following the big 2.0.0 release last year, we continue to improve Jolokia by clearing the backlog and adding new features and improvements.

With 2.0.1 release we’re fixing custom log handler configuration. We also integrate better with [Spring Boot Actuator](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/3.2.2/reference/html/actuator.html#actuator.endpoints.enabling) by handling `management.endpoint.jolokia.enabled` property.

As always, please refer to [changelog](https://jolokia.org/changes-report.html#a2.0.1) for more details.

### Jolokia 2.0 arrives: A new chapter begins!

2023-12-19

![jolokia2 presents](images/jolokia2-presents.png)

We are excited to announce the long-awaited release of Jolokia 2.0, now available in [Maven Central](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/jolokia/).

This release is a result of our dedicated effort in reviewing, restructuring, refactoring, and polishing. Here’s what Jolokia 2.0 brings to the table:

* Support for JakartaEE 9+ (Servlet API 5+ with `jakarta.servlet` packages)
* Enhanced connectivity with JMX notifications
* Integration with Spring Boot 3 and Spring Framework 6
* A fresh, pluggable service-based architecture
* A revamped and user-friendly [Reference Manual](reference/html/index.html) powered by Antora
* JDK 11 is the minimal version of JDK required. Spring related Jolokia modules require JDK 17. (No worries, we’re still supporting Jolokia 1.x with minimal version of JDK 1.6 supported).

And that’s not all. We’re already planning more frequent updates, including exciting new features like websockets and IPv6 support.

Jolokia 2 also gears up to seamlessly integrate with the upcoming [Hawtio 4.0](https://github.com/orgs/hawtio/projects/1)!

It should be straightforward to upgrade to new Jolokia 2 in JVM agent mode. WAR agent users should use any compatible JakartaEE 9+ container. Check out our [Migration to 2.x](migration.html) guide for more information.

Your support and patience over these years have been incredible. We’re grateful for your enduring loyalty. Let’s end this year on a high note and step into 2024 with new energy and possibilities!

Warm regards,

Grzegorz, Tadayoshi, Roland

### Jolokia has a new home!

2023-07-13

Yes, finally we moved Jolokia from my (rhuss) personal
account to a dedicated GitHub organisation:
<https://github.com/jolokia>.
I’m super happy that the story of Jolokia continues and you
will see quite some new faces very soon. Thanks Tadayoshi,
Grzegorz, Aurélien and all the other fine folks from Red Hat
who started to revive Jolokia. Also, Jolokia 2.0 becomes a realistic
option again. Stay tuned!

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1559317#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2018-03-22 09:46:11 UTC  ```  An XSS attack can be performed by manipulating the mimeType query parameter to coerce the Web browser to display the JSON response directly. However, the Jolokia responses are not shown directly in the browser but used by a JavaScript library, which has to perform its own escaping of user provided response data.  External References:  <https://jolokia.org/#Security_fixes_with_1.5.0>  References:  <https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGJOLOKIA-32136>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1559317#c7)  Andrej Nemec    2018-05-14 15:25:15 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having security impact of Low for: * Red Hat OpenStack Platform 9.0 (Mitaka) * Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.0 (Newton)  * Red Hat OpenStack Platform 11.0 (Ocata) * Red Hat OpenStack Platform 12.0 (Pike)  Although the affected code is present in shipped packages, data returned by Jolokia is correctly processed and invalid data is not used.  This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: <https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/>.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1559317#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-09-11 07:54:25 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Fuse  Via RHSA-2018:2669 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2669](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2669)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1559317#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-12-11 14:12:25 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Fuse  Via RHSA-2018:3817 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3817](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A3817)   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1595332#c0)  Laura Pardo    2018-06-26 16:05:31 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way Apache CXF handle exceptions when CXF is configured to use the com.sun.net.ssl implementation via System.setProperty("java.protocol.handler.pkgs", "com.sun.net.ssl.internal.www.protocol") function. When this system property is set, CXF uses some reflection to try to make the HostnameVerifier work with the old com.sun.net.ssl.HostnameVerifier interface. However, the default HostnameVerifier implementation in CXF does not implement the method in this interface therefore an exception is thrown. The exception is caught in the reflection code but not properly propagated which leaves CXF client subject to man-in-the-middle attacks.

The XSS attack happens only when you are using the Jolokia response directly in an browser and when you set the mimeType to e.g. text/html and provoke an error with an error message containing html code. But as you normally consume Jolokia responses via some client lib (javascript or java) you are not directly affected normally. I.e. I dont know any app showing Jolokia JSON responses directly in the browser.

Hello,

I think that the CVE is not correctly declared so SCA/dependency analyser (like dependency-check) are not able to detect it.

See <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1000129>

`Configuration 1 OR cpe:2.3:a:jolokia:jolokia:1.3.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*`

Only version 1.3.7 will be detected. I think it should be something like:

`cpe:2.3:a:jolokia:jolokia:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:* versions up to (excluding) 1.5.0`

* do you know how to update it? who could be contacted to solve that?
* same issue with: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1000130>

Thanks,

Sorry, something went wrong.
