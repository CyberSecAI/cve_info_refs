    "summary": "The provided content discusses CVE-2018-1000129, a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Jolokia HTTP servlet. It outlines how the vulnerability can be triggered by manipulating the `mimeType` query parameter to force the browser to display the JSON response directly. Although, the usual consumption method is not directly affected as Jolokia responses are used by JavaScript libraries that should properly escape response data, the vulnerability exists and was fixed in version 1.5.0.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of the `mimeType` parameter in the Jolokia HTTP servlet, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "Improper input sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could perform a XSS attack by manipulating the `mimeType` query parameter, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution in the victim's browser if the Jolokia response is directly shown by a browser.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Manipulation of the `mimeType` query parameter"
      ],
       "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to craft a request to the Jolokia HTTP servlet with a malicious `mimeType` parameter. Typically, they would need to have the ability to manipulate the request or have an endpoint that uses Jolokia to make requests. It is also specified that such an attack would most likely need the user to directly display the Jolokia response in a browser (which is an uncommon use case, as Jolokia is usually consumed via a javascript library which will have it's own escaping).",
        "additional_details": [
          "The vulnerability is triggered by coercing the web browser to display the JSON response directly by setting a malicious `mimeType`.",
          "The typical use case (with Jolokia responses used by a JavaScript library) is not usually vulnerable because JavaScript libraries are expected to escape user-provided response data.",
          "The fix involves validating and sanitizing the mimeType parameter to only accept specific values (e.g. 'text/plain' and 'application/json').",
           "The `callback` parameter is also validated to ensure it's a valid JavaScript function name in order to prevent XSS.",
          "The vulnerability was fixed in `jolokia-core` version 1.5.0."
