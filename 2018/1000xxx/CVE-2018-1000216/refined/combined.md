## Description

[![@projectgus](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/205573?v=4&size=48)](/projectgus)[projectgus](https://github.com/projectgus)opened [on Feb 7, 2018](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON/issues/241#issue-295038038)

I was taking a look at the cJSON codebase on behalf of a customer, and I a spot that I wanted to check when printing cJSON\_Raw values:

* If item->valuestring is NULL, the print\_value() implementation [may deallocate the write buffer and then return](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON/blob/master/cJSON.c#L1314). However, at least some callers of print\_value() (for example print()) will also deallocate this buffer on failure. This looks like a potential double-free.

I haven't had time to be verify this for certain, or write a test, but I thought I would report it while I had it in front of me. Seems like it's probably an unlikely path to hit in real code.

EDIT: Previous version of this issue had two points. For one, I missed that the memcpy included the terminating byte.
