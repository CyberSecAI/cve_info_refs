- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A double-free vulnerability exists in the `cJSON` library when printing `cJSON_Raw` values.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `print_value()` function may deallocate the write buffer if `item->valuestring` is NULL, and some callers of `print_value()` (e.g., `print()`) might also attempt to deallocate the same buffer upon failure, leading to a double-free.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A double-free vulnerability can lead to crashes and potentially enable further memory corruption exploits.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could craft a specific JSON input that triggers the vulnerable code path when printing `cJSON_Raw` values, specifically when the `valuestring` is NULL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to control the input JSON being processed by the vulnerable code and trigger the printing of a raw `cJSON` element with a NULL `valuestring`.
