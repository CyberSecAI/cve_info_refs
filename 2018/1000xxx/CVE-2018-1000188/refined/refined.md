Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000188:

**CVE Description:**

The provided content details a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the CAS Plugin for Jenkins.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a form validation method within the CAS plugin that lacks proper permission checks. This allows any user with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to trigger a GET request to an arbitrary URL specified by the attacker. Additionally, the form validation method did not require POST requests, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The plugin allows an attacker to make Jenkins send a GET request to an arbitrary URL.
*   **Missing Permission Checks:** The form validation method does not verify if the user has the necessary permissions to access and use it.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The form validation method could be triggered via a GET request instead of the more appropriate POST request which resulted in a CSRF vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can cause Jenkins to make requests to internal or external resources. This can lead to:
    *   Information disclosure if the target resource returns sensitive data.
    *   Abuse of internal APIs or services, potentially leading to further exploitation.
    *   Port scanning of internal networks if the attacker supplies a range of URLs to try.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker crafts a malicious request to the vulnerable form validation method of the CAS Plugin.
*   The attacker must have Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have at least Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
*   The attacker needs to know the structure of the vulnerable form validation endpoint.
*   No user interaction is required beyond accessing the Jenkins instance.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by requiring POST requests for the form validation method and enforcing the Overall/Administer permission.
*   The affected version of the CAS Plugin is 1.4.1 and earlier, and the fix is in version 1.4.2.
* This vulnerability is also identified as **SECURITY-809** in the Jenkins advisory.
