Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000182:

**1. Verification:**

   - The provided content includes a description of **CVE-2018-1000182**, explicitly stating it as a "Server-side request forgery vulnerability in Git Plugin". This confirms the content is related to the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The vulnerability stems from **missing permission checks** in various form validation methods within the Git plugin.
   - These validation methods also **did not require POST requests**, resulting in a **CSRF vulnerability**.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  The lack of permission checks allowed unauthorized users to trigger GET requests to arbitrary URLs, controlled by the attacker.
   - **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The absence of POST request requirements enabled attackers to exploit the vulnerability via forged requests.
   - **Missing Authorization:**  The plugin failed to verify the user's permissions before processing form validation requests.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - An attacker with "Overall/Read" access to Jenkins could:
     - Force the Jenkins server to send GET requests to URLs of their choosing.
     - Potentially access internal resources or services that are available from the Jenkins server but not to external users.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - The attack vector involves sending crafted requests to vulnerable form validation methods within the Git plugin.
   - An attacker can exploit this without needing any specific user interaction if they can craft the request.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - The attacker needs to have "Overall/Read" access to the Jenkins instance. This suggests the attack can be carried out by someone with a low level of privileges within the Jenkins environment.
    - No other special capabilities beyond sending HTTP requests to the Jenkins server and being able to specify an external target URL are necessary.

**Additional Notes from the Content:**

* The fix for this vulnerability involves requiring POST requests for these validation methods and enforcing the "Overall/Administer" permission.
* The advisory explicitly lists version 3.9.0 and earlier of the Git plugin as being affected. The fix is in version 3.9.1.
* The provided content also includes other vulnerabilities found in the Git, GitHub, GitHub Branch Source, GitHub Pull Request Builder, Kubernetes, CAS, AbsInt Astree, Black Duck Hub, and Black Duck Detect plugins.
* The content includes a reference to `[SECURITY-810]` which corresponds to the mentioned CVE.
* CVSS score is noted as medium:  `AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N`
