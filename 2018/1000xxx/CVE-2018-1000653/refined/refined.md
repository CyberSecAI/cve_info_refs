The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in ZZCMS.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of the `$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']` variable directly in a SQL query within the `/zt/top.php` file. This variable is user-controlled via the Host header, making the application vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to sanitize the `HTTP_HOST` header before using it in an SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This could lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete compromise of the database server and the application.
- As demonstrated with `sleep()` function, attackers can infer the success of their injection attempts.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is the `Host` header in the HTTP request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable ZZCMS application. The attacker doesn't need special privileges.
