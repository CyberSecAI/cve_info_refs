Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The qutebrowser's history page was vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The browser was parsing and rendering HTML tags present in website titles stored in the browser history. This allowed for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the `qute://history/` page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **XSS vulnerability:** The core vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of website titles before displaying them in the history page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML/JavaScript into a visited page's title, which then gets executed when the history page is viewed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the `qute://history/` page. This could allow them to:
   - Steal cookies and session data related to the browser.
   - Modify content displayed on the history page.
   - Potentially execute further attacks by manipulating the browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript in a website's title. This is done by crafting a website that, when visited, saves a malicious title into the browser history. When the user opens the browser history page, the injected script will execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a website.
- The user must visit the attacker's website and then open the browser's history page.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability was located in the `qutebrowser/browser/qutescheme.py` file.
- The fix involved escaping HTML entities in the URL and title when generating the history data.
-  The code change in `qutescheme.py` shows the use of `html.escape()` to sanitize both the URL and title before rendering in history.
- A test case was also added which includes a crafted HTML page (`tests/end2end/data/issue4011.html`) with a malicious title, used to verify the fix using an end-to-end test (`tests/end2end/features/history.feature`).

This information is more detailed than the description available in the CVE itself, and provides a good understanding of the vulnerability.
