The provided content relates to CVE-2018-1000857.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `log-user-session` tool, designed for tamper-proof logging of SSH sessions, uses the `SSH_CLIENT` environment variable to derive the log file name. The tool fails to sanitize this variable, allowing an attacker to inject directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) and create files in arbitrary locations. Additionally, the tool uses the `open()` system call without the `O_NOFOLLOW` flag, making it susceptible to symlink attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Inadequate input sanitization:** The tool does not sanitize the `SSH_CLIENT` environment variable before using it to construct the log file path.
*   **Directory traversal:** An attacker can use directory traversal sequences to write log files in arbitrary locations.
*   **Symlink attack vulnerability:** The absence of the `O_NOFOLLOW` flag during file opening allows an attacker to exploit symbolic links.
*   **SUID binary**: The program needs to run as SUID to perform the logging tasks, increasing the attack surface if vulnerabilities are present.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary file creation:** An attacker can create files at any location on the system with user-provided content.
*   **Privilege escalation:** By creating a symbolic link to a system configuration file (e.g., `/etc/cron.d/`), an attacker can potentially achieve root privileges.
*   **Tamper-proof logging bypass:** The vulnerability bypasses the designed tamper-proof nature of the logging system, allowing attackers to potentially manipulate logs.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Crafted `SSH_CLIENT` environment variable:** An attacker can craft a malicious `SSH_CLIENT` environment variable containing directory traversal sequences.
*   **Execution of SUID binary**: The attacker can execute the SUID binary directly, and use the crafted `SSH_CLIENT` variable to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Local user access:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system where `log-user-session` is installed as SUID.
*   **Ability to execute the SUID binary:** The attacker must be able to execute the vulnerable `log-user-session` binary.
