Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000512:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in the `[kttg_glossary]` shortcode of the "Tooltipy (tooltips for WP)" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input used in the generation of the glossary page when using the shortcode. Specifically, the `cat` parameter in the URL is not sanitized, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Admin browser hijacking:** An attacker can send a crafted link to a logged-in WordPress admin user. When the admin clicks this link, the attacker's malicious JavaScript will execute within the admin's browser session.
*   **Privilege escalation:**  Because the attacker's JavaScript runs within the admin's browser, the attacker can perform actions with the same permissions as the admin user. This could include:
    *   Creating new admin users
    *   Modifying content
    *   Injecting further malicious scripts
    *   Taking full control of the site

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious link:** The attacker crafts a URL containing the `[kttg_glossary]` shortcode on a page on the target website and malicious JavaScript in the `cat` parameter which is then sent to the victim.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick an administrator of a WordPress site using the vulnerable plugin into clicking the link. No other specific capabilities are required.

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerability was discovered on 2018-03-29 and fixed on 2018-05-21, with the updated plugin available for download on 2018-06-05.
* The vulnerable version is 5.0 and earlier. The fixed version is 5.1 and later.
