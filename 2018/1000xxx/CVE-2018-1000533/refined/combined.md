This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Fixed RCE in git grep.

```
A specific option in git grep could be added inside the
pattern to be searched for, resulting in possible RCE.

Thanks to Kacper Szurek (<https://security.szurek.pl>) for
catching this one!
