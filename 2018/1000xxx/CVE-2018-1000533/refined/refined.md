{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the improper sanitization of user-supplied input used in the `git grep` command. Specifically, the code failed to remove certain options passed through the search query, allowing for the injection of arbitrary git options.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper input sanitization leading to command injection.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote Code Execution (RCE) is possible due to the ability to inject arbitrary git options through the search query.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker can inject malicious git options within the search query string.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to submit a crafted search query via the application's interface."
