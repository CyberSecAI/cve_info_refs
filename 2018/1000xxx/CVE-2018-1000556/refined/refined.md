- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `page-uri` GET parameter is not sanitized before being used in the construction of URLs and is later outputted without escaping.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page, potentially allowing them to steal cookies or perform other actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious URL with a `page-uri` parameter containing JavaScript, and tricking a user into visiting the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to generate a malicious URL and have a victim click on the link while logged into the WordPress admin panel. The vulnerability can be exploited if the user visits a page under the admin panel that displays the date range selection.
