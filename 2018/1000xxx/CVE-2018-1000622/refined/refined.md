  "CVE-2018-1000622": {
    "Description": "The Rust Programming Language rustdoc version Between 0.8 and 1.27.0 contains a CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element vulnerability in rustdoc plugins that can result in local code execution as a different user. This attack appear to be exploitable via using the --plugin flag without the --plugin-path flag. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in 1.27.1.",
    "Root cause": "Uncontrolled Search Path Element vulnerability in rustdoc plugins.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "CWE-427"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local code execution as a different user.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Using the --plugin flag without the --plugin-path flag."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Local access to the system"
  },
  "CVE-2019-12083": {
    "Description": "The Rust Programming Language Standard Library 1.34.x before 1.34.2 contains a stabilized method which, if overridden, can violate Rust's safety guarantees and cause memory unsafety. If the `Error::type_id` method is overridden then any type can be safely cast to any other type, causing memory safety vulnerabilities in safe code (e.g., out-of-bounds write or read). Code that does not manually implement Error::type_id is unaffected.",
    "Root cause": "Overriding the `Error::type_id` method can violate Rust's safety guarantees.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory unsafety",
      "Type confusion"
    ],
    "Impact": "Memory safety vulnerabilities, out-of-bounds write or read.",
     "Attack vectors": [
       "Overriding the `Error::type_id` method."
     ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to modify/override the `Error::type_id` method."
