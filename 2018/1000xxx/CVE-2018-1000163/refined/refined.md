- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing input validation for the `manufacturerDescription` field in `net/floodlightcontroller/core/SwitchDescription.java` and lack of output escaping in the Floodlight web console at `ui/js/models/switchmodel.js`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Missing Input Validation:** The Floodlight controller does not validate the `manufacturerDescription` field received from OpenFlow switches.
    - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `manufacturerDescription` is displayed in the web console without proper escaping, allowing for injection of malicious JavaScript code.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - **Remote Code Execution:** By injecting XSS payloads, an attacker can make the web console execute arbitrary REST API calls.
    - **Network Disruption:** This can lead to network disconnection or monitoring of traffic.
    - **Privilege Escalation:** An adversary can escalate privileges from a compromised switch to compromise the entire network.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - A compromised OpenFlow switch sends a malicious `manufacturerDescription` via the OpenFlow protocol to the Floodlight controller.
    - When an administrator views the switch's details in the Floodlight web console, the injected XSS payload is executed in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to compromise an OpenFlow switch to send malicious data to the controller.
    - The attacker also needs the ability to make an administrator access the web console of the controller.
