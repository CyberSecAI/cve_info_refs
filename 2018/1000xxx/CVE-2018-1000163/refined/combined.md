## Floodlight Remote Command Execution

Posted on
2018-03-30

It is a serious vulnerability in the latest version of Floodlight (V1.2).

With this vulnerability, an adversary can escalate his privilege to compromise the whole network via a compromised OpenFlow switch[1]. For example, he can remotely disconnect the whole network or monitor any traffic with only the switch’s privilege.

Here we demonstrate this vulnerability in a video. We first compromised an SDN switch with known security issue, and then we exploit our vulnerability to further attack controller (disconnect **another** switch’s network).

In Floodlight v1.2, Input validation for manufacturerDescription is missing in net/floodlightcontroller/core/SwitchDescription.java:77-89. Floodlight simply retrieves manufacturer name via packet sent by the switch and set it as manufacturerDescription.
Hence a malicious switch can set an arbitrary string to manufacturerDescription via OpenFlow Protocol.

| ``` 123456789101112131415 ``` | ``` public SwitchDescription(String manufacturerDescription,        String hardwareDescription, String softwareDescription,        String serialNumber, String datapathDescription) {    this.manufacturerDescription = manufacturerDescription;    this.hardwareDescription = hardwareDescription;    this.softwareDescription = softwareDescription;    this.serialNumber = serialNumber;    this.datapathDescription = datapathDescription;}public SwitchDescription(OFDescStatsReply descStatsReply) {    this(descStatsReply.getMfrDesc(), descStatsReply.getHwDesc(),            descStatsReply.getSwDesc(), descStatsReply.getSerialNum(),            descStatsReply.getDpDesc());} ``` |
| --- | --- |

In Floodlight web console ui/js/models/switchmodel.js:35-42, Floodlight doesn’t escape manufacturer name. Hence we can inject Cross Site Script payload into the web console to have it access arbitrary rest API to execute an arbitrary command.

```
//console.log("fetching switch " + this.id + " desc")
 $.ajax({
        url:hackBase + "/wm/core/switch/" + self.id + '/desc/json',
        dataType:"json",
        success:function (data) {
        //console.log("fetched  switch " + self.id + " desc");
        //console.log(data['desc']);
        self.set(data['desc']);
        }
        });

```

[1] It is worth noting that OpenFlow switches are vulnerable to multiple remote attacks (e.g., Buffer Overflow[CVE-2016-2074], Arbitrary Read [CVE-2017-9265]). Hence, it is feasible for adversaries to attack the switch from arbitrary hosts.
