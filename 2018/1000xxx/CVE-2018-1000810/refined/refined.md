  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in the `str::repeat` function when passed a large number.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Integer overflow",
    "Out-of-bounds write"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of Service (DoS) condition may be triggered by an out of bounds write.",
  "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can cause the vulnerability by controlling the input to Rust's `str::repeat` function.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control the value passed to Rust's str::repeat function. This vulnerability is remotely exploitable."
