## Security advisory for the standard library

Sept. 21, 2018 Â· The Rust Core Team

The Rust team was recently notified of a security vulnerability affecting
the standard library's `str::repeat` function. When passed a large number this
function has an integer overflow which can lead to an out of bounds write. If
you are not using `str::repeat`, you are not affected.

We're in the process of applying for a CVE number for this vulnerability. Fixes
for this issue have landed in the Rust repository for the stable/beta/master branches.
Nightlies and betas with the fix will be produced tonight, and 1.29.1 will be
released on 2018-09-25 with the fix for stable Rust.

You can find the full announcement on our rustlang-security-announcements mailing
list [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rustlang-security-announcements/CmSuTm-SaU0).

# Rust: Multiple vulnerabilities â€” GLSA **201812-11**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Rust, the worst which
may allow local attackers to execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/rust** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.29.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.29.1** |

| Package | **dev-lang/rust-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.29.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.29.1** |

### Background

A systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents
segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Rust. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker able to control the value passed to Rustâ€™s
str::repeat function could possibly cause a Denial of Service condition.

In addition, a local attacker could trick another user into executing
arbitrary code when using rustdoc.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Rust users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/rust-1.29.1"

```

All Rust binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/rust-bin-1.29.1"

```
