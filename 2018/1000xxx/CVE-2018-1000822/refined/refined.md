Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000822:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an XML External Entity (XXE) injection.
- The application, Codelibs Fess, uses an insecurely configured XML parser to process uploaded GSA XML files. Specifically, the `SAXParserFactory` is used without disabling external entity resolution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **XXE Injection:** The application parses XML input without proper sanitization or configuration to prevent external entity inclusion. This allows an attacker to embed malicious external entity references within XML files, which the server then processes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Disclosure of confidential data:** An attacker could potentially read local files from the server by referencing them in an XML external entity.
- **Denial of service (DoS):** By including a very large or recursive external entity, the attacker could cause the server to consume excessive resources, potentially leading to a DoS condition.
- **Server-side request forgery (SSRF):** The attacker may be able to force the server to make requests to arbitrary internal or external servers, potentially revealing internal services or bypassing firewalls.
- **Port scanning:** The attacker could use the vulnerable server to scan internal network ports.
- **Other system impacts:** The exploitation may result in other impacts depending on the available resources and network setup.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker must upload a specially crafted XML file to the admin backup functionality. This file must have an external entity defined to be processed by the vulnerable code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to have access to the admin interface that allows for uploading XML files.
- The attacker must be able to craft a malicious XML file containing the external entity definitions.

**Code Snippet:**
The vulnerable code is located in `AdminBackupAction.java` within the `fess` project:

```java
else if (fileName.startsWith("gsa") && fileName.endsWith(".xml")) {
    final GsaConfigParser configParser = ComponentUtil.getComponent(GsaConfigParser.class);
    try (final InputStream in = form.bulkFile.getInputStream()) {
        configParser.parse(new InputSource(in));
    }
}
```
The vulnerability exists within the `configParser.parse(new InputSource(in));` line, where an external entity included in the uploaded file will be processed by the parser without restrictions.
