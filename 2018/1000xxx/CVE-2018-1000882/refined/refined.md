Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000882:

**CVE-2018-1000882:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `register.php` and `user_login.php` scripts echo user-supplied input back to the client without sanitization when a form action fails.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML markup into the web page, which can then be executed in the browsers of other users who visit the page. This could be used for various malicious purposes, including session hijacking, phishing, or defacement.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker needs to send a crafted request to `user_login.php` or `register.php` with malicious JavaScript code within the form fields. When the login or registration fails, the unsanitized input is reflected back into the HTML of the response.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated. They need to entice a victim to visit the crafted URL, and the vulnerability is triggered when the login or registration action fails, reflecting the input back to the user.

The provided content from `github.com` shows the code changes that were made to fix the vulnerabilities, specifically the sanitization of user input using `$system->cleanvars()`.

The content from `telekomsecurity.github.io` provides more detail, including:

*   An explanation of how the reflected XSS is triggered (failed login/registration).
*   The general impact of XSS attacks.
*   References to the bug reports and the commit containing the fix.
*   A timeline of vulnerability discovery and disclosure.
