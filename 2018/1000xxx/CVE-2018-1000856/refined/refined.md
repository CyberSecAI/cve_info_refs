- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input when creating a new segment, leading to the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary scripts or HTML, which will be executed in the browsers of other users who view the vulnerable page. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, such as session hijacking, cookie theft, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious payload in the "new_name" parameter when creating a new segment via a POST request to `http://127.0.0.1/domainmod/segments/add.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable server and has to be able to create a new segment. The attacker does not need any other privileges than the ability to access this page.
