Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2018-1000003
*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the DNSSEC validation component of the PowerDNS Recursor. It improperly allows an ancestor delegation NSEC or NSEC3 record to be used to prove the non-existence of a resource record (RR) below the owner name of the record.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Insufficient validation of DNSSEC signatures, specifically related to ancestor delegation NSEC/NSEC3 records.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can spoof the non-existence of a DNS record (NXDOMAIN), even if the record actually exists. This is known as a "denial of existence spoofing".
*   **Attack Vectors:** A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker is required to inject the crafted DNS responses.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be in a position to intercept and modify DNS traffic (man-in-the-middle).

**Affected Software:**
*   PowerDNS Recursor 4.1.0 is vulnerable.
*   PowerDNS Recursor versions prior to 4.1.0 and 4.1.1 are not affected.

**Mitigation:**
*   Upgrade to a non-affected version of PowerDNS Recursor (>= 4.1.1)
*   Apply the provided patch if an upgrade is not immediately possible.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that the vulnerability was discovered and reported by CZ.NIC
*   A link to a related discussion on the knot-dns-users mailing list is provided.
*   The impact is considered "low", and there is no risk of system compromise.
