# XR3Player XXE

October 28, 2018 · Sajeeb Lohani · CVE-2018-1000830

## The Issue

An XML External Entity attack is a type of attack against an application that parses XML input. This attack occurs when XML input containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser. This attack may lead to the disclosure of confidential data, denial of service, server side request forgery, port scanning from the perspective of the machine where the parser is located, and other system impacts.

XR3Player insecurely parses user-supplied XML content within the ParsePlaylist.java file, allowing attackers to perform XXE attacks.
