Fix capacity comparison in reserve

You can otherwise end up in a situation where you don't actually resize
but still call into handle_cap_increase which then corrupts head/tail.

Closes [#44800](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/44800)

Not totally sure the right way to write a test for this - there are some debug asserts the old bad behavior will hit but we don't build the stdlib with debug assertions by default.

## Description

[![@jesse99](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/425055?v=4&size=48)](/jesse99)[jesse99](https://github.com/jesse99)opened [on Sep 24, 2017](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/44800#issue-260048846)

I've been seeing lots of bad behavior trying to use VecDeque. I've boiled it down to a relatively simple example which shows some of the bad behavior I was seeing and additionally seg faults.

This was with:

rustc 1.20.0 ([f3d6973](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/f3d6973f41a7d1fb83029c9c0ceaf0f5d4fd7208) 2017-08-27)

binary: rustc

commit-hash: [f3d6973](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/f3d6973f41a7d1fb83029c9c0ceaf0f5d4fd7208)

commit-date: 2017-08-27

host: x86\_64-apple-darwin

release: 1.20.0

LLVM version: 4.0

and also rust 1.19

The output I expect to see is:

> old packet = 00 88 01 02 03 04 05 06 01 02 03 04 05 06 01 02 03 04 05 06 00 37 03 80 45 14 00 14 00 15 00 17

The output I get is:

> old packet = 00 88 01 02 03 04 05 06 01 02 03 04 05 06 01 02 03 04 05 06 00 37 03 80 45 14 00 14 00 15 00 17

> Segmentation fault: 11

Note that the fourth from the last byte should be D9.

Work around seems to be to use a large VecDeqeue capacity.

Here's the code:

```
use std::collections::VecDeque;
use std::fmt;

pub struct Packet
{
	pub payload: VecDeque<u8>,
}

pub struct Header
{
	pub data: Vec<u8>,
}

impl Packet
{
	pub fn new() -> Self
	{
		let payload = VecDeque::with_capacity(32);
		Packet{payload}
	}

	pub fn len(&self) -> usize
	{
		self.payload.len()
	}

	pub fn push_header(&mut self, header: &Header)
	{
		self.payload.reserve(header.data.len());
		for b in header.data.iter().rev() {
			self.payload.push_front(*b);
		}
	}

	pub fn push_back_bytes(&mut self, data: &[u8])
	{
		self.payload.extend(data.iter());
	}
}

impl fmt::Debug for Packet
{
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result
	{
		let mut bytes = String::with_capacity(3*self.len());
		for i in 0..self.payload.len() {
			bytes.push_str(&format!(" {:02X}", self.payload[i]));
		}

        write!(f, "{}", bytes)
    }
}

impl Header
{
	pub fn new() -> Self
	{
		let data = Vec::with_capacity(20);
		Header{data}
	}

	pub fn with_capacity(capacity: usize) -> Self
	{
		let data = Vec::with_capacity(capacity);
		Header{data}
	}

	pub fn push8(&mut self, data: u8)
	{
		self.data.push(data);
	}

	pub fn push16(&mut self, data: u16)
	{
		self.data.push((data >> 8) as u8);
		self.data.push((data & 0xFF) as u8);
	}

	pub fn push32(&mut self, data: u32)
	{
		self.data.push((data >> 24) as u8);
		self.data.push(((data >> 16) & 0xFF) as u8);
		self.data.push(((data >> 8) & 0xFF) as u8);
		self.data.push((data & 0xFF) as u8);
	}

	pub fn push_bytes(&mut self, data: &[u8])
	{
		self.data.extend(data);
	}
}

fn push_ipv4(packet: &mut Packet)
{
	let payload_len = packet.len();
	let mut header = Header::with_capacity(20);

	let b = 0x45;						// version + IHL (we don't support options so length is fixed)
	header.push8(b);

	header.push8(20);

	let hw = 20 + payload_len;			// total length
	header.push16(hw as u16);

	header.push16(21);	// identification
