Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000110:

**Vulnerability:** Disclosure of user names and node names to unauthorized users through post-commit hook URL in Git Plugin.

*   **Root Cause:** The Git plugin's handling of unauthenticated post-commit hook notification requests at the `/git/` path was incorrectly extending a class that handled requests to the `.../search/` sub-path.
*   **Weaknesses:** Improper access control, specifically the lack of authentication and authorization checks for the `/git/` endpoint.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker could submit search queries to Jenkins through the `/git/` endpoint, gaining access to a list of search results, which typically include user names (both actual Jenkins users and SCM committers) and node names (built-in node and agents).
    *   This information disclosure could facilitate further attacks by providing reconnaissance data on the Jenkins environment and its users/nodes
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Sending a crafted HTTP request to the `/git/` path on the Jenkins server.
    *   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the Jenkins server.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability is specific to the Git plugin's handling of unauthenticated post-commit hook notification requests, which are typically used for triggering builds when changes are pushed to a Git repository.
*   The vulnerability is similar to those identified in Subversion and Mercurial plugins, which had the same underlying issue of improperly extending the search handling class in their respective post-commit hook handlers.
*   The fix involves ensuring the class handling `/git/` requests no longer extends the class handling search queries, preventing unauthorized access to search results.
