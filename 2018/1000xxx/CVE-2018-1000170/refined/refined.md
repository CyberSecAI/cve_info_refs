**Root cause of vulnerability:** Unsafe inclusion of item names in JavaScript confirmation dialogs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that are executed in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to information disclosure or unauthorized actions.

**Attack vectors:**  A malicious user with the permission to create or configure items can insert malicious JavaScript code into the item name. When a confirmation dialog is displayed, the unescaped item name containing the malicious JavaScript code is executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to create or configure items in Jenkins. They also need to be able to trick a user into interacting with a dialog containing the crafted name.
