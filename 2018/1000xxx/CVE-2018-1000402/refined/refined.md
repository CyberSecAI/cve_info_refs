Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000402:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The AWS CodeDeploy Plugin for Jenkins was persisting environment variables from the last build within the job's `config.xml` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** The plugin was storing potentially sensitive environment variables in the job's configuration file.
- **Lack of proper storage practices:** The environment variables were not being treated as sensitive and were not encrypted or handled securely.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Users with filesystem access to the Jenkins controller or those with the Extended Read permission could potentially obtain these stored environment variables by accessing the job's `config.xml` file. This could expose sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, or other credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File System Access:** An attacker with access to the Jenkins controller's file system can directly read the `config.xml` files to extract the environment variables.
- **Extended Read Permission:**  A user with Extended Read permissions within Jenkins can access and view the configuration files and potentially extract the stored environment variables.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs either access to the Jenkins controller's file system or to possess the "Extended Read" permission within the Jenkins environment.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in version 1.20 of the AWS CodeDeploy Plugin. This version no longer stores build environment variables on disk.
- Existing job `config.xml` files will continue to retain the stored environment variables until the job configuration is saved again, meaning administrators have to save the configuration again to remediate the issue completely.
