Release
# Zammad 2.4.0, 2.3.1 & 2.2.2

March 29, 2018 ¬∑ We are pleased to release Zammad 2.4.

Now to the release. Besides the bugfix release *Zammad 2.3.1*, *Zammad 2.2.2* we also release the new *Zammad 2.4.0* with the following major improvements.

## [Zammad 2.4.0 & 2.3.1 & 2.2.2 (Major and Patch Level)](#zammad-2-4-0-2-3-1-2-2-2-major-and-patch-level)

### Feature #1: Autocompletion when replying

When creating tickets, the customer could already be searched for by auto-completion. If you wanted to forward an e-mail or take other people into the "Cc" when replying, you previously had to enter the complete e-mail address yourself.

This is now a thing of the past. As of today, known addresses can become recipients when forwarding or replying via auto-completion.

![Zammad Screenshot autocomplete](https://zammad.com/media/pages/releases/2-4/1a0822368d-1698589017/feature-autocomplete-1280x.jpg)

### Feature #2: Generic Clone in the admin area

It happens more often that similar objects (e.g. users, groups or signatures) have to be created in the admin area. This is annoying and no fun - and is now a thing of the past. From now on objects with all attributes can be duplicated in the admin area.

![Zammad Screenshot admin clone](https://zammad.com/media/pages/releases/2-4/2da8933812-1698589017/feature-admin-clone-1280x.jpg)

### Feature #3: RichText - Adjusting the image size

Up to now, the size of an image could only be adjusted in a few browsers, since this was not supported by everyone.

This has not stopped us from making it available to all browsers. Have fun with that.

![Zammad Screenshot richtext image adjustment](https://zammad.com/media/pages/releases/2-4/b279e40bf2-1698589017/feature-richtext-image-adjustment-1280x.jpg)

### Feature #4: REST API - Requests on behalf of another user

With the Zammad REST API you can quickly and easily perform actions on tickets. Many users use this function for integration (e.g. integrating a customer's tickets into their own customer portal). However, write actions were logged in the name of the executing API user and not the name of the user who executed the action itself in the customer portal.

Using an "X-On-Behalf-Of" header, actions can now be performed in Zammad that are to take place on behalf of another user.

Detailed information can be found in the API documentation at the following URL:

<https://docs.zammad.org/en/latest/api-intro.html#example-curl-request-on-behalf-of-a-different-user>

### Breaking Change #1: Authorization to Edit Agents/Administrators

In Zammad, up to version 2.4, it was possible (unintentionally) as an agent to edit administrator accounts and save attributes such as `Active` or `Email` modified. These actions have now been "restricted".

A detailed overview of the possible actions can be found in the Zammad < 2.4 matrix.

Matrices:

Zammad >= 2.4

| accessed | admin.user | sub admin without admin.user | agent | same customer | same organization | different customer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| admin | read, change, delete | read | read | - | - | none |
| agent | read, change, delete | read | read | - | - | none |
| customer | read, change, delete | read | read, change | read | read | none |

Zammad < 2.4

| accessed | admin.user | sub admin without admin.user | agent | same customer | same organization | different customer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| admin | read, change, delete | none | read, change, delete | - | - | none |
| agent | read, change, delete | none | read, change, delete | - | - | none |
| customer | read, change, delete | none | read, change, delete | read, change, delete | none | none |
