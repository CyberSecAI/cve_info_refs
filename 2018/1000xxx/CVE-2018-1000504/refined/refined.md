Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The Redirection plugin for WordPress allows administrators to specify a redirect target URL.
- When the target URL starts with `file://`, the plugin directly includes the file specified in the path using the PHP `include()` function.
- This bypasses any checks and allows arbitrary PHP code execution if the included file contains PHP code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Arbitrary File Inclusion:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation and sanitization of the redirect target URL. Specifically, the plugin processes `file://` URLs by directly including the file in the `include()` function.
- **Unrestricted File Access:** The vulnerability gives access to the server file system.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not sanitize the file path or verify if the target is a valid file type.
- **Unvalidated Admin Input**: The plugin trusts admin input without any security considerations

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker with administrator access can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server by creating a file containing malicious code and then using the plugin's redirection feature to include that file. This leads to complete system compromise.
- **Full System Control:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to read, write, and execute files, potentially leading to data breaches, website defacement, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request**: An administrator can specify a `file://` URI as a redirect target using the plugin's admin interface

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Administrator Access:** The attacker must have administrator-level privileges on the WordPress site to access the plugin settings and create/modify redirects.
- **Knowledge of File Paths:** The attacker needs to know or be able to guess the file paths on the server where they can create files or access existing files containing PHP code.
- **Ability to Upload Files:** The attacker must be able to upload a file containing malicious PHP code. The proof of concept demonstrates this by uploading a crafted image file.

**Additional Notes**
- The advisory mentions that if the URL is not `http`, `https` or `file`, then the code allows the `$_GET` parameter to be contaminated with unescaped values, which may result in SQL injections. However, this is not the primary issue related to the CVE.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.8 of the plugin.
- The proof of concept provides a clear, step-by-step guide to how an attacker could exploit the vulnerability.
- The advisory includes a timeline of the vulnerability disclosure and remediation process.
