Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `ajaxdiscussion.php` file of the i-librarian project. This file lacks proper authorization checks to verify if a user is a member of the specified project before allowing access to discussion messages.  The `discussion.php` file does implement this check, however `ajaxdiscussion.php` does not.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing Authorization Check:** The `ajaxdiscussion.php` file fails to verify if the user is a member of the project before allowing them to read, post, or delete messages. This allows unauthorized users to perform actions on project discussions.
- **Direct Object Reference:** The vulnerability allows manipulation of the `project` parameter directly, enabling attackers to access and manipulate content by knowing or guessing the `project` identifier.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can:
- **Read unauthorized project messages:** A user not belonging to a project can read all messages in that project's discussion.
- **Delete all project messages:** A user not belonging to a project can delete all messages in that project's discussion.
- **Post new messages to the project:** An attacker can post arbitrary messages to a project they are not a member of, potentially disrupting the discussion or posting malicious content.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Direct HTTP Request Manipulation:** Attackers can directly access `ajaxdiscussion.php` with crafted parameters like `project`, `read`, `delete`, and `newmessage` to perform unauthorized actions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Knowledge of the target application:** The attacker needs to know that `ajaxdiscussion.php` exists and the purpose of the parameters.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Ability to guess or discover project IDs**: The attacker needs to know the project IDs to target specific discussions.
