## Description

[![@xiaoyinl](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16713498?v=4&size=48)](/xiaoyinl)[xiaoyinl](https://github.com/xiaoyinl)opened [on Mar 23, 2018](https://github.com/mkucej/i-librarian/issues/124#issue-307910559)

For example, if user1 creates a project and invites some users into this project. User2 is not in this project. If user2 visits `http://127.0.0.1/librarian/discussion.php?project=1` directly, he gets "Error! You are not authorized to see this project." But if user2 visits `http://127.0.0.1/librarian/ajaxdiscussion.php?project=1&read=1`, he is able to read the messages for this project. Similarly user2 can use `project=1&delete=1` to delete all messages, and `project=1&newmessage=...` to post new messages.

The bug is in ajaxdiscussion.php. Unlike [discussion.php](https://github.com/mkucej/i-librarian/blob/master/discussion.php#L19), [ajaxdiscussion.php](https://github.com/mkucej/i-librarian/blob/master/ajaxdiscussion.php) doesn't check if the current user is in the specified project.
