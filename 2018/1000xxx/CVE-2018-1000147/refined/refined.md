### CVE-2018-1000147

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Perforce Plugin implements its own credential encryption using DES and an encryption key stored in its public source code. Jenkins does not consider this a secret.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure credential encryption with a hardcoded key.

**Impact of exploitation:** Exposure of Perforce credentials stored in job configurations to users with Extended Read permission. The DES encryption is easily broken due to the publicly available key, allowing unauthorized access to the credentials.

**Attack vectors:** An attacker with Job/Extended Read permission can access job configurations and decrypt the stored Perforce credentials.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs Job/Extended Read permission in Jenkins. They also need the ability to access and decrypt the credential, which is made easier by the hardcoded key.
