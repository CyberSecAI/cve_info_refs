Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2018-1000050:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an unchecked length calculation within the `stb_vorbis` library, specifically during residue decoding. The `residue->begin` and `residue->end` values were not properly validated against the actual block size. This could lead to out-of-bounds reads and writes due to incorrect memory allocation/access when decoding malformed or corrupt vorbis files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Input Validation:** The code lacked proper checks to ensure that `r->begin` and `r->end` values did not exceed the allowed size, which is related to half the block size of the decoded audio.
- **Potential for Out-of-Bounds Access:**  If `r->begin` and `r->end` have malicious values, they could cause reads and writes outside the allocated memory during residue decoding. This could lead to a crash or potential remote code execution.
- **Incorrect Size Calculation:** Before the fix, the code was calculating the memory needed for residue decoding based on the potentially invalid values of `r->begin` and `r->end`. The fix restricts these to be within the boundaries `actual_size`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** A malformed Vorbis file with crafted `r->begin` and `r->end` could cause the `stb_vorbis` library to crash when trying to decode the residue.
- **Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE):** While not explicitly stated, out-of-bounds reads and writes can be used to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Audio Files:** A crafted or corrupted Ogg Vorbis file is the primary attack vector. This file would contain specially crafted `r->begin` and `r->end` values in the residue configuration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide a malicious Ogg Vorbis file:** The attacker needs to provide the vulnerable application with a specially crafted Ogg Vorbis file, which will then be processed by the `stb_vorbis` library.
- **No special privileges required** an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by simply getting a user to process the malformed audio file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The commit message "fix unchecked length in stb\_vorbis that could crash on corrupt/invalid files" directly relates to the fix for this vulnerability.
- The commit diff shows how `limit_r_begin` and `limit_r_end` were introduced to limit the values of `r->begin` and `r->end` against the `actual_size` which is equal to half of the block size (`f->blocksize_1/2`).
- The code comment in version history `1.12 - 2017/11/21 - limit residue begin/end to blocksize/2 to avoid large temp allocs in bad/corrupt files` also relates directly to the patch.
