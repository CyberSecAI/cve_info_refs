### @tjlang **[tjlang](/tjlang)** commented [Feb 3, 2017](#issue-205229331)

v1.1 Changes (02/03/17):

1. Removed ability to ingest or output data via the pickle module. User

   must have xarray installed to output data.
2. Import expects xarray name, and no longer accepts the old name xray.

Sorry, something went wrong.
