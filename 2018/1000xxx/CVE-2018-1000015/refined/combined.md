# Authorize Project

How to install

* [Documentation](/authorize-project/)
* [Releases](/authorize-project/releases/)
* [Issues](/authorize-project/issues/)
* [Dependencies](/authorize-project/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/authorize-project/healthscore/)

This plugin allows projects to run builds with specified authorization.

## What's this?

This plugin provides following features:

* You can configure projects to have their builds run with specified authorization.
  + This is an implementation of [QueueItemAuthenticator](http://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins/security/QueueItemAuthenticator.html).
* Provides following ways to specify authorization.
  + Run as the user who triggered the build.
    - Does not work for scheduled, or polled builds.
    - Configuring projects are allowed only to users with the BUILD permission.
  + Run as anonymous.
  + Run as the specified user.
    - You are requested to enter the password of the specified user except in the following cases:
      * You are an administrator.
      * You are the specified user.
      * The specified user is not changed from the last configuration, and "No need for re-authentication" is checked.
        + This can be a security risk
    - Configuring projects are allowed only to administrators and the user configured as the authorization.
      * "Don't restrict job configuration" allows other users (with the CONFIGURE permission) to configure the project. Ensure that only appropriate users have CONFIGURE permission for that project.
  + Run as SYSTEM
    - This is provided only to cancel the global configuration. SYSTEM authorization is often considered as "unconfigured", features provided by plugins may treat it as anonymous.
* Provides an extension point to add new ways to specify authorization.

## Screenshots

* The plugin adds "Access Control for Builds" in "Manage Jenkins" > "Configure Global Security". Adding "Configure Build Authorizations in Project Configuration" enables Authorize Project plugin.

  + You can also disable specific strategies in this page. Disabled strategies are never used for authorization.
* A new side bar menu "Authorization" will appear in project pages. [![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/authorize-project-plugin@master/docs/images/sidebar.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/authorize-project-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/sidebar.png)
* You can select how to authorize builds of the project in the "Authorization" page. [![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/authorize-project-plugin@master/docs/images/authorization-page.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/authorize-project-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/authorization-page.png)
* When selecting "Run as Specific User", you can enter User ID with whose authorization builds will run. If you enter a user ID except yourself and have no administrative privilege, you are required to enter the password of that user. [![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/authorize-project-plugin@master/docs/images/authorization-page-specific-user.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/authorize-project-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/authorization-page-specific-user.png)
  + You can also use API token, especially for non password-based security realms.
* Configuring project settings by unauthorized users are forbidden when you configure the authorization for the project. See [What's this](https://github.com/jenkinsci/authorize-project-plugin/blob/master/)? for details.

## Extension point

A new way to authorize projects can be added by extending [`AuthorizeProjectStrategy`](https://javadoc.jenkins.io/plugin/authorize-project/org/jenkinsci/plugins/authorizeproject/AuthorizeProjectStrategy.html), overriding the following method:

```
public abstract Authentication authenticate(
    hudson.model.AbstractProject<?, ?> project,
    hudson.model.Queue.Item item
);

```

Use `AuthorizeProjectStrategyDescriptor` for `Descriptor`. If you want to provide global configuration properties, do as following:

* `global-security.jelly` is displayed in "Configure Global Security" page.
* Override `AuthorizeProjectStrategyDescriptor#configureFromGlobalSecurity` to save configuration.

## Description

### XXE vulnerabilities in multiple static analysis plugins

* **SECURITY-655 / CVE-2018-1000008** (PMD)
* **SECURITY-656 / CVE-2018-1000009** (Checkstyle)
* **SECURITY-657 / CVE-2018-1000010** (DRY)
* **SECURITY-658 / CVE-2018-1000011** (FindBugs)
* **SECURITY-695 / CVE-2018-1000012** (Warnings)

Multiple plugins based on [Static Analysis Utilities](https://plugins.jenkins.io/analysis-core) plugin are affected by an XML External Entity (XXE) processing vulnerability.
This allows attacker to configure build processes such that one of these plugins parses a maliciously crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

External entity resolution has been disabled for these plugins.

### CSRF vulnerability in Release plugin

**SECURITY-607 / CVE-2018-1000013**

Release plugin did not require form submissions to be submitted via POST, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability allowing attackers to trigger release builds.

Access to the form action URL now requires POST.

### CSRF vulnerability in Translation Assistance plugin

**SECURITY-507 / CVE-2018-1000014**

Translation Assistance plugin did not require form submissions to be submitted via POST, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability allowing attackers to override localized strings displayed to all users on the current Jenkins instance if the victim is a Jenkins administrator.

Access to the form action URL now requires POST.

### Incorrect permission checks in Pipeline: Nodes and Processes plugin allows executing builds on agents while lacking Computer/Build permission

**SECURITY-675 / CVE-2018-1000015**

On instances with [Authorize Project plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/authorize-project), the authentication associated with a build may lack the Computer/Build permission on some agents.
This did not prevent the execution of `node` blocks on those agents due to incorrect permissions checks in Pipeline: Nodes and Processes plugin.

Build permissions on agents are now properly enforced for `node` steps.

### XSS vulnerability in job configuration forms in Ant plugin

**SECURITY-624 and SECURITY-694**

Ant plugin failed to escape tool names it shows on job configuration screens, resulting in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that is exploitable only by Jenkins administrators.

This is the same vulnerability that was announced without a fix on [2017-12-05](/security/advisory/2017-12-05/).
Contrary to what we wrote in that security advisory, Ant Plugin shows both the JDK and Ant tools on the configuration screen, and the vulnerability in Ant plugin was responsible for both problems we confirmed in the previous advisory.

Ant plugin now correctly escapes tool names shown on the job configuration screen.
