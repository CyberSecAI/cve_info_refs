Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000015:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause lies in the Pipeline: Nodes and Processes plugin not properly enforcing build permissions on agents when used in conjunction with the Authorize Project plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Incorrect permission checks in the Pipeline: Nodes and Processes plugin.
- The authentication associated with a build may lack the Computer/Build permission on some agents.
- The `node` block executions on agents were not properly enforcing permissions due to the above.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on Jenkins agents without having the necessary Computer/Build permissions.
- This could lead to privilege escalation, data breaches, or denial-of-service attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

- An attacker would need to trigger a pipeline build that uses the `node` step.
- The build's authorization may lack the required Computer/Build permission on the target agent.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker would need to be able to create or trigger builds and have at least the ability to configure pipelines.
- They would also need knowledge of how to utilize the `node` step in pipelines.
- The Jenkins instance must be using both the Authorize Project plugin and the vulnerable version of the Pipeline: Nodes and Processes plugin.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability exists when the Authorize Project plugin is also in use, indicating a dependency on the interaction between these plugins.
- The advisory explicitly states that the fix involves properly enforcing build permissions on agents for `node` steps.
