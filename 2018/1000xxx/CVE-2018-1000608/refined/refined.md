Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000608:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The IBM z/OS Connector Plugin stored password credentials in plain text in its configuration files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Plaintext Storage of Credentials:** The plugin failed to encrypt or securely store passwords, leaving them vulnerable to exposure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Disclosure:** Attackers with access to the Jenkins controller's file system could read the configuration files and obtain the plaintext passwords.
- **Potential Unauthorized Access:** The exposed passwords could be used to gain unauthorized access to the connected z/OS systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File System Access:** An attacker with direct access to the Jenkins controller's file system could retrieve the configuration files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the Jenkins controller's file system. This typically requires some form of local system access.
- Additionally, this security advisory mentions that the password was transferred in plain text to administrators when accessing the global configuration form, which is an additional attack vector with less restrictions.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability existed in versions 1.2.6.1 and earlier of the IBM z/OS Connector Plugin.
- The fix implemented in version 2.0.0 and newer integrates with the Jenkins Credentials Plugin, which handles secure credential storage.
- The advisory notes that while the password was masked in the UI, it was still transmitted in plaintext.
