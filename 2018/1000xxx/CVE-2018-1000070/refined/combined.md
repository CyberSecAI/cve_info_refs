It's allows a remote execution, but it probably crashed for most people before it could execute anything. In the logs I see attempts to run a windows executable and to steal electrum wallet files.

[@PeterSurda](https://github.com/PeterSurda) god damn. Using eval() should be illegal by law.

This is used in encode() ... but still it is called on the data coming from network then?

Requesting CVE number for it? Remote arbitrary code execution in widely used application...

Sorry, something went wrong.

This still doesn't feel ideal. Although it isn't arbitrary code anymore, you still let untrusted data specify which method to call on an object. Is this a temporary fix or the final one?

I am open for suggestions on how to improve it. I haven't build the binaries yet, possibly I'll release 0.6.3.1 with an improved fix, but I had to move quickly.

I'd probably assert that `title()` is one of the known/expected values before invoking it, or something like that. In the longer run, it's probably better to make it a more formal message parser: see langsec/weird machines and so on: <http://langsec.org/>

yeah as [@copumpkin](https://github.com/copumpkin) mentioned this could need some input validation.

and maybe also check the [other evals](https://github.com/Bitmessage/PyBitmessage/blob/fd1a6c1fa14ab719f43d97ad52f464826fb32b4c/src/bitmessagecli.py#L379)? Usually there is not many reasons to use eval.

Yeah, `eval` is a huge no-no in security-sensitive software (so all of it, really). In some cases the input might effectively be trusted, but it's easier to just outlaw `eval` so people don't have to stare extra hard at code using it to make sure it's not stupid.

Did someone used message type `Vote` ever? [@copumpkin](https://github.com/copumpkin) [title()](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/stdtypes.html#str.title), if you have no such file or no such class in it - it will be ignored.

Oh, I'm sorry, I misunderstood what was going on. It still seems good to explicitly validate this sort of thing. If only so that future readers can see when behavior like this changes, and can be sure that it's actually running against an explicitly defined message schema rather than relying on reflective behavior against a living codebase.

[@g1itch](https://github.com/g1itch) vote doesn't really do anything, it's an example.

[@copumpkin](https://github.com/copumpkin) I'll restrict extended encoding to "message" type for the time being, it can be loosened later after a more thorough review.

To prevent serious damage from such kind of vulnerabilities, you should write SELinux/AppArmor/Firejail profiles and bundle it with the application.

[@PeterSurda](https://github.com/PeterSurda), I wanna know how this have happened that such a backdory function like `eval` have appeared in such a security-critical application as bitmessage. I wanna know which measures are you going to take to make this kind of backdoors never appear again.

IMHO at least we need a blacklist of functions which must not be used in bm and any of it dependencies. All the PRs using them must be automatically rejected. All the PR's introducing new dependencies must be rejected. Dependencies and all their dependencies must be checked and forked and freezed and installed only from this project's repos, not from pip. Only after creating an own fork of dependencies which involves manual checking a dependency may be used.

I also have some ideas about building security into python interpreter, I'm currently trying to convert my thoughts into a document.

[@KOLANICH](https://github.com/KOLANICH) And the bug appeared because I am a guy who decided to take care of an abandoned project that I found very important not realising the huge scope of such an endeavor. Luckily there are more contributors in the meantime who do review my code, and the workflow has slightly improved.

[@sigoa](https://github.com/sigoa) not only, I'm currently working on a draft of the spec combining taint checking, mandatory access control, capability-based security and permissions into a framework enforcing that

* no data from network and other untrusted sources will be passed into security-sensitive functions like `eval`
* no sensitive data will be leaked into untrusted destinations like net
* no sensitive data resulted in invocation of a privileged API will be available to any module not having a permission to read results from that API
* every module will have to explicitly declare the API inputs to which that it controls
* and I hope that the framework can be applied to real-world applications

but I have some problems with proofs because the functions to explicitly change taints spoil all the picture, in presence of these functions I cannot prove anything, in absence the scheme is complete garbage unusable in real world apps. For example a private key is a sensitive piece of data, that's why everything touched by it will also be marked as sensitive, even the digital signature which is in fact by default not sensitive assumming no vulnrs in crypto. To solve this issue we need to mark it as non-sensitive, but doing so spoils the whole picture, we cannot prove that the system is secure anymore.

For now I recommend to start implementing taint checking using some frameworks available for python.

Thank you [@KOLANICH](https://github.com/KOLANICH) , the security audit job is still open, but contributions that either harden the code directly, or provide a framework for hardening too. Since the vulnerability was revealed, I launched a multi-pronged approach, here are some of the highlights:

### Infrastructure

* infrastructure (build, bootstrap, website, ...) was hardened and separated from the development environment. This way, even if I get hacked, other people can continue developing, binaries can continue to be built, people can connect to the network. I now have a separate laptop for accessing the infrastructure
* my development environment was also hardened and I increased the use of smart cards for authentication and encryption

### Development

* all new code, including mine, has to be reviewed before being merged
* better integration with codacy, and I fine-tuned some settings
* existing code will have all the codacy complaints fixed before I do further development (well, maybe some can't be fixed entirely, but they will be treated)
* design documentation will be reverse-enginered from the code so that it's easier for new developers/reviewers to understand what's happening
* I'll do less development and work more on design/organisational layer

### Other things

* I spent about 2 weeks reading through CVs an interviewing developers, and recruited a company to help me with the development. This means more people fixing coding issues and reviewing the code
* I sent some money to tip4commit so that contributors can be better rewarded, and I want to institute a bug bounty program
* I got rid of ALL the evals in the code. There are still some `call`s, e.g. the apinotify or the `make` for autobuilding the C PoW. These are more difficult to get rid of, but at least they can be hardened somewhat

[@sigoa](https://github.com/sigoa) Yep, can't assign a label.

> design documentation will be reverse-enginered from the code so that it's easier for new developers/reviewers to understand what's happening

Could I ask you to write the docs to the message format in Kaitai Struct language (parser can be auto-generated further from the docs, it is machine-readable formal language)? Here is my draft (I have reverse-engineered it from the code and existing docs, but have not tested it anyhow) <https://github.com/KOLANICH/kaitai_struct_formats/blob/bitmessage/network/bitmessage.ksy>, I expect you to check and test it and develop further. If you wanna check it against a pcap dump inthe same repo you can find a parser for [pcap](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_formats/blob/pcapng/network/pcapng.ksy) and [pcapng](https://github.com/KOLANICH/kaitai_struct_formats/blob/pcapng/network/pcapng.ksy) formats and my lib <https://github.com/KOLANICH/Pipeline.py> (which in fact was created for the [similar task](https://github.com/KOLANICH/USBPcapOdinDumper) ) may be useful too.

> increased the use of smart cards

which ones?

> I now have a separate laptop for accessing the infrastructure

I hope without any backdoors by Intel/AMD/longsoon/any other chineese/taiwanese/russian company/etc?

> interviewing developers, and recruited a company to help me with the development

I see you are serious with it. Are you going to make business on it? But how are you going to make it sustainable? This will require money and I see no legitimate (backdors are certainly illegitimate) sources of money providing enough money for such a project (you know, most of people don't need decentralised systems, they only need fashionable centralised things: whatsapp, viber, telegram, instagram, prisma, Alexa, Cortana, Siri, iPhone, etc, and without a big market company will likely go bankrupt), maybe except a grant by Mozilla.

> Could I ask you to write the docs to the message format in Kaitai Struct

I'll look at it in more detail. It looks like a wire protocol specification, which is fine, but I want specification of both the Bitmessage system design as well as how PyBitmessage is put together (like what are the threads, what are they doing, and so on). For example the wire protocol specification cannot specify when an inv is being sent, what the handshake sequence looks like, and so on. It's also unclear to me at this point how TLS is supposed to be specified in Kaitai Struct.

> which ones? (smartcards, e.d.)

So far Yubikey and Nitrokey are being tested. I'd also consider Trezor and Nano Ledger S but they look like an overkill. I also have a separate code signing card (Win/OSX), forgot who the manufacturer is, but I want to replace it as I'm not happy with it.

> I hope without any backdoors by Intel/AMD/longsoon/any other chineese/taiwanese/russian company/etc?

I don't know any laptops guaranteed without backdoors, apart from some very old models which aren't practically usable anymore, or they can't be bought in a physical shop in Europe. The one I bought has a CPU that according to specifications doesn't have TXE. If that means that the ME is entirely absent I don't know. The closest to what I want is probably Purism Librem (which uses Coreboot and has ME disabled) but I don't know how to get it in a physical shop in Europe.

> Are you going to make business on it? But how are you going to make it sustainable? This will require money and I see no legit sources of money providing enough money for such a project, maybe except a grant by Mozilla.

I've been thinking about revenue possibilities for quite some time and looking for a co-founder for about a year. I now found someone and we're investigating a particular business plan (he on the business side, me on the technical side). The details will be announced in due time. There are other possible business plans that can be investigated when we see growth. Supporting the project through grants is a possibility but I don't see it as a sustainable one.

It's binary formats spec, not protocol. Protocol spec is yet to be created, IMHO verilog shkuld be used for protocols specs.

> but I want specification of both the Bitmessage system design as well as how PyBitmessage is put together

I only advised a part suitable for describing message format.

> It's also unclear to me at this point how TLS is supposed to be specified in Kaitai Struct.

I have not implemented tls messages. And I guess BM has nothing to do with tls itself, tls should be managed by tls libraries, not by PBM itself.

> I now found someone

I hope it's not government agencies or cybercriminals.

## [Hiding a comment](#hiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can hide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

If a comment is off-topic, outdated, or resolved, you may want to hide a comment to keep a discussion focused or make a pull request easier to navigate and review. Hidden comments are minimized but people with read access to the repository can expand them.

![Screenshot of a hidden comment. The only visible content is "This comment has been minimized", with a button to show the comment.](/assets/cb-13766/images/help/repository/hidden-comment.png)

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to hide.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Hide**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Hide" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42438/images/help/repository/comment-menu-hide.png)
3. Using the "Choose a reason" dropdown menu, choose a reason to hide the comment. Then select **Hide comment**.

   ![Screenshot of a comment showing a menu to select a reason to hide the comment: Spam, Abuse, Off Topic, Outdated, Duplicate, or Resolved.](/assets/cb-67538/images/help/repository/choose-reason-for-hiding-comment.png)

## [Unhiding a comment](#unhiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can unhide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to unhide.
2. On the right side of the comment, click  **Show comment**.
3. On the right side of the expanded comment, select the  dropdown menu, then click **Unhide**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment marked as spam. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Unhide" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-50118/images/help/repository/comment-menu-hidden.png)

## [Editing a comment](#editing-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can edit comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

It's appropriate to edit a comment and remove content that doesn't contribute to the conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Sometimes it may make sense to clearly indicate edits and their justification.

That said, anyone with read access to a repository can view a comment's edit history. The **edited** dropdown at the top of the comment contains a history of edits showing the user and timestamp for each edit.

![Screenshot of a comment by octo-user, which is partially redacted. In the header, next to "edited by octocat", a dropdown icon is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42069/images/help/repository/content-redacted-comment.png)

## [Redacting sensitive information](#redacting-sensitive-information)

Comment authors and anyone with write access to a repository can also delete sensitive information from a comment's edit history. For more information, see [Tracking changes in a comment](/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/tracking-changes-in-a-comment).

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to edit.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Edit**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Edit" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42473/images/help/repository/comment-menu-edit.png)
3. In the comment window, delete the content you'd like to remove, then type `[REDACTED]` to replace it.
4. At the bottom of the comment, type a note indicating that you have edited the comment, and optionally, why you edited the comment.
5. Click **Update comment**.

## [Deleting a comment](#deleting-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can delete comments on issues, pull requests, and commits. Organization owners, team maintainers, and the comment author can also delete a comment on a team page.

If a comment contains some constructive content that adds to the conversation in the issue or pull request, you can edit the comment instead.

Deleting a comment is your last resort as a moderator. It's appropriate to delete a comment if the entire comment adds no constructive content to a conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Deleting a comment creates a timeline event that is visible to anyone with read access to the repository. However, the username of the person who deleted the comment is only visible to people with write access to the repository. For anyone without write access, the timeline event is anonymized.

![Screenshot of a timeline event, which says "octo-org deleted a comment from hubot 6 minutes ago."](/assets/cb-10760/images/help/issues/anonymized-timeline-entry-for-deleted-comment.png)

Note

The initial comment (or body) of an issue or pull request can't be deleted. Instead, you can edit issue and pull request bodies to remove unwanted content.

### [Steps to delete a comment](#steps-to-delete-a-comment)

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to delete.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Delete**.
   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Delete" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42453/images/help/repository/comment-menu-delete.png)
3. Optionally, write a comment noting that you deleted a comment and why.

## Description

Bitmessage PyBitmessage version v0.6.2 (and introduced in or after commit 8ce72d8d2d25973b7064b1cf76a6b0b3d62f0ba0) contains a Eval injection vulnerability in main program, file src/messagetypes/**init**.py function constructObject that can result in Code Execution. This attack appears to be exploitable via remote attacker using a malformed message which must be processed by the victim - e.g. arrive from any sender on bitmessage network. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in v0.6.3.

More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
