Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-1000070:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the use of `eval()` in the `constructObject` function within the `src/messagetypes/__init__.py` file of the PyBitmessage application. This allowed for the execution of arbitrary code by injecting malicious code through a crafted message.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Eval Injection:** The primary weakness is the use of `eval()`, which interprets a string as code and executes it. This is dangerous because it allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code if the string is derived from user-controlled data (in this case, data from a network message).
- **Lack of Input Validation:** There was insufficient validation or sanitization of the input data, specifically the message type, before it was passed to `eval()`. This allowed an attacker to control the code being executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This could potentially lead to:
    - Complete system compromise.
    - Data theft or manipulation.
    - Installation of malware.
    - Denial of service.
- According to one of the developers, there were logs of attempts to run windows executables and steal electrum wallet files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Messages:** The attack vector is through specially crafted network messages sent to a PyBitmessage user. These messages are processed using the vulnerable `constructObject` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote and does not require any prior access to the victim's system.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send messages to a Bitmessage node on the network.
- **Crafted Message:** The attacker needs to create a malformed Bitmessage message containing malicious code that will be processed by the vulnerable `eval` statement.
- **No user interaction is required** beyond the user having the Bitmessage client open and running.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in version v0.6.2 of PyBitmessage and possibly earlier versions due to the commit history mentioned.
- It was fixed in version v0.6.3 by removing the usage of eval.
- There were suggestions to implement more formal message parsing and input validation to avoid similar vulnerabilities in the future.
- It was also suggested to use a blacklist of functions, including `eval`, that should not be used in the project.
- There were discussions about using static analysis tools and other security measures to further harden the application.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 8.8 (High), indicating its severity.
- The exploit is considered low complexity.
