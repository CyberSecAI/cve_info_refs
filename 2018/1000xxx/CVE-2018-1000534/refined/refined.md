The provided content is related to CVE-2018-1000534.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application was vulnerable to XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks due to the use of `html: true` in the MarkdownIt configuration, which allowed execution of arbitrary HTML within the application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Arbitrary HTML could be injected through markdown and rendered in the application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers could inject malicious scripts into notes.
- This could potentially lead to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious markdown content containing HTML tags.
- User would have to render a note containing the malicious markdown.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker must be able to create/modify a note with malicious markdown content.
- User must open/render the crafted note for the payload to be triggered.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by setting `html: false` in the MarkdownIt configuration, thus disabling arbitrary HTML rendering and preventing XSS attacks.
- A limited set of HTML tags such as `<br>` is now supported by replacing the string representation `&lt;br&gt;` with the `<br>` tag after the markdown has been rendered.
- The fix was implemented in commit `494e235e18659574f836f84fcf9f4d4fcdcfcf89`
