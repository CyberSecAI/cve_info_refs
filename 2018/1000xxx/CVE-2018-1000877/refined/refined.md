Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000877:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a double-free condition in the RAR decoder within the `libarchive` library. Specifically, the issue occurs in the `parse_codes()` function, where `realloc(rar->lzss.window, new_size)` is called with `new_size` equal to 0. When `realloc` is passed a size of 0 it frees the memory region and the cleanup function then also attempts to free the memory again, resulting in a double-free.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Double-Free:** The core vulnerability is a double free, where the same memory location is freed twice. This is a classic memory corruption vulnerability.
- **Improper Input Validation:** The vulnerability is triggered because the code doesn't properly validate or handle a `new_size` value of 0.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The double-free vulnerability can lead to a crash of the application, resulting in denial of service.
-  **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** The initial reports suggest the possibility of arbitrary code execution, however, there is no confirmed evidence of this exploitability.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Specially crafted RAR archive:** The vulnerability is triggered when a victim opens a specially crafted RAR archive file. The attacker can control aspects of the archive such as window size used in the realloc calculation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious RAR archive.
-   The attacker needs the victim to open the crafted RAR archive using a vulnerable version of `libarchive`.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `libarchive` versions from commit 416694915449219d505531b1096384f3237dd6cc onwards (release v3.1.0 onwards).
*   The vulnerability is located in the file `archive_read_support_format_rar.c`, specifically in the `parse_codes()` function.
* The fix involves adding a validation check before calling realloc, ensuring that realloc is only called if `new_size` is greater than 0.
*   Multiple vendors and distributions including Debian, Red Hat, SUSE, Fedora and Ubuntu were affected and have released patches for this CVE.
