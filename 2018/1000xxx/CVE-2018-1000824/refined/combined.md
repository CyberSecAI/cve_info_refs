## Description

[![@prodigysml](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16996819?u=8ac045207384ce660425a4fdded4a836e20988a2&v=4&size=48)](/prodigysml)[prodigysml](https://github.com/prodigysml)opened [on Sep 29, 2018](https://github.com/MegaMek/megamek/issues/1162#issue-365131233)
# The Issue

Object Deserialization Injection attacks utilise overly trusted user-controlled input, passed to deserialisation functions. The deserialisation of objects can trigger certain methods within the object, allowing the attacker to perform unauthorised actions like execution of code, disclosure of information, etc.

# Where the Issue Occurred

Displayed below is the code within the project, where the user input is passed into the deserialisation function:

[megamek/megamek/src/megamek/common/net/ObjectStreamConnection.java](https://github.com/MegaMek/megamek/blob/f28ccf9826aab5bdabe0e7631da0562bb79311de/megamek/src/megamek/common/net/ObjectStreamConnection.java#L67)

Line 67

[f28ccf9](/MegaMek/megamek/commit/f28ccf9826aab5bdabe0e7631da0562bb79311de)

|  | packet = (NetworkPacket) in.readObject(); |
| --- | --- |

The above code can be manipulated by specially crafted network packets.
