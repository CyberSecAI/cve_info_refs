The provided content describes a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Grafana query editor.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Grafana query editor for Graphite and InfluxDB does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the "FROM" field.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS: Malicious JavaScript code can be inserted into the "FROM" field and stored in the application's database. The code is then executed when the field is viewed by other users.
- Improper input sanitization: The application does not adequately sanitize the input provided to the "FROM" field in the query editor, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser: An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could allow them to steal cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive information.
- Account takeover: With access to session information, the attacker might be able to take over user accounts.
- Data manipulation: Depending on the specific permissions of the user, the attacker could also potentially manipulate or modify data within the Grafana platform.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious payload injected into the "FROM" field in the query editor.
- The attacker needs to have the permission to modify queries.
- The attack is triggered when a victim views the dashboard containing the malicious query.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs access to the Grafana query editor with the ability to create or edit queries.
- The attacker must be able to set the "FROM" field to a malicious payload.
- No other specific user privileges are mentioned.
