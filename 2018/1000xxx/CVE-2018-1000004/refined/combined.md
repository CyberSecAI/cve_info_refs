                 CVE-2018-1000199

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2015-9016

    Ming Lei reported a race condition in the multiqueue block layer
    (blk-mq).  On a system with a driver using blk-mq (mtip32xx,
    null_blk, or virtio_blk), a local user might be able to use this
    for denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-0861

    Robb Glasser reported a potential use-after-free in the ALSA (sound)
    PCM core.  We believe this was not possible in practice.

CVE-2017-5715

    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
    processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
    controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes
    running on the system.

    This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 2 (branch
    target injection) and is mitigated for the x86 architecture (amd64
    and i386) by using the "retpoline" compiler feature which allows
    indirect branches to be isolated from speculative execution.

CVE-2017-5753

    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
    processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
    controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes
    running on the system.

    This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 1
    (bounds-check bypass) and is mitigated by identifying vulnerable
    code sections (array bounds checking followed by array access) and
    replacing the array access with the speculation-safe
    array_index_nospec() function.

    More use sites will be added over time.

CVE-2017-13166

    A bug in the 32-bit compatibility layer of the v4l2 ioctl handling
    code has been found. Memory protections ensuring user-provided
    buffers always point to userland memory were disabled, allowing
    destination addresses to be in kernel space. On a 64-bit kernel a
    local user with access to a suitable video device can exploit this
    to overwrite kernel memory, leading to privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-13220

    Al Viro reported that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation could
    dereference a pointer before performing the necessary type check.
    A local user could use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2017-16526

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the UWB subsystem may dereference
    an invalid pointer in an error case.  A local user might be able
    to use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-16911

    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP vhci_hcd driver exposed
    kernel heap addresses to local users.  This information could aid the
    exploitation of other vulnerabilities.

CVE-2017-16912

    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver failed to
    perform a range check on a received packet header field, leading
    to an out-of-bounds read.  A remote user able to connect to the
    USB/IP server could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-16913

    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver failed to
    perform a range check on a received packet header field, leading
    to excessive memory allocation.  A remote user able to connect to
    the USB/IP server could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-16914

    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver failed to
    check for an invalid combination of fields in a received packet,
    leading to a null pointer dereference.  A remote user able to
    connect to the USB/IP server could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-18017

    Denys Fedoryshchenko reported that the netfilter xt_TCPMSS module
    failed to validate TCP header lengths, potentially leading to a
    use-after-free.  If this module is loaded, it could be used by a
    remote attacker for denial of service or possibly for code
    execution.

CVE-2017-18203

    Hou Tao reported that there was a race condition in creation and
    deletion of device-mapper (DM) devices.  A local user could
    potentially use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-18216

    Alex Chen reported that the OCFS2 filesystem failed to hold a
    necessary lock during nodemanager sysfs file operations,
    potentially leading to a null pointer dereference.  A local user
    could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-18232

    Jason Yan reported a race condition in the SAS (Serial-Attached
    SCSI) subsystem, between probing and destroying a port.  This
    could lead to a deadlock.  A physically present attacker could
    use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2017-18241

    Yunlei He reported that the f2fs implementation does not properly
    initialise its state if the "noflush_merge" mount option is used.
    A local user with access to a filesystem mounted with this option
    could use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2018-1066

    Dan Aloni reported to Red Hat that the CIFS client implementation
    would dereference a null pointer if the server sent an invalid
    response during NTLMSSP setup negotiation.  This could be used
    by a malicious server for denial of service.

CVE-2018-1068

    The syzkaller tool found that the 32-bit compatibility layer of
    ebtables did not sufficiently validate offset values. On a 64-bit
    kernel, a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user
    namespace) could use this to overwrite kernel memory, possibly
    leading to privilege escalation. Debian disables unprivileged user
    namespaces by default.

CVE-2018-1092

    Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image would
    trigger a null dereference when mounted.  A local user able
    to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this for denial of
    service.

CVE-2018-5332

    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not
    sufficiently validate RDMA requests, leading to an out-of-bounds
    write.  A local attacker on a system with the rds module loaded
    could use this for denial of service or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2018-5333

    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not properly
    handle an error case, leading to a null pointer dereference.  A
    local attacker on a system with the rds module loaded could
    possibly use this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-5750

    Wang Qize reported that the ACPI sbshc driver logged a kernel heap
    address.  This information could aid the exploitation of other
    vulnerabilities.

CVE-2018-5803

    Alexey Kodanev reported that the SCTP protocol did not range-check
    the length of chunks to be created.  A local or remote user could
    use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2018-6927

    Li Jinyue reported that the FUTEX_REQUEUE operation on futexes did
    not check for negative parameter values, which might lead to a
    denial of service or other security impact.

CVE-2018-7492

    The syzkaller tool found that the RDS protocol was lacking a null
    pointer check.  A local attacker on a system with the rds module
    loaded could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-7566

    Fan LongFei reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound)
    sequencer core, between write and ioctl operations.  This could
    lead to an out-of-bounds access or use-after-free.  A local user
    with access to a sequencer device could use this for denial of
    service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-7740

    Nic Losby reported that the hugetlbfs filesystem's mmap operation
    did not properly range-check the file offset.  A local user with
    access to files on a hugetlbfs filesystem could use this to cause
    a denial of service.

CVE-2018-7757

    Jason Yan reported a memory leak in the SAS (Serial-Attached
    SCSI) subsystem.  A local user on a system with SAS devices
    could use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2018-7995

    Seunghun Han reported a race condition in the x86 MCE
    (Machine Check Exception) driver.  This is unlikely to have
    any security impact.

CVE-2018-8781

    Eyal Itkin reported that the udl (DisplayLink) driver's mmap
    operation did not properly range-check the file offset.  A local
    user with access to a udl framebuffer device could exploit this to
    overwrite kernel memory, leading to privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-8822

    Dr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported that the ncpfs client
    implementation did not validate reply lengths from the server.  An
    ncpfs server could use this to cause a denial of service or
    remote code execution in the client.

CVE-2018-1000004

    Luo Quan reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound) sequencer
    core, between multiple ioctl operations.  This could lead to a
    deadlock or use-after-free.  A local user with access to a
    sequencer device could use this for denial of service or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-1000199

    Andy Lutomirski discovered that the ptrace subsystem did not
    sufficiently validate hardware breakpoint settings.  Local users
    can use this to cause a denial of service, or possibly for
    privilege escalation, on x86 (amd64 and i386) and possibly other
    architectures.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.16.56-1.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-trusty](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-trusty) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty for Precise ESM

## Details

USN-3798-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 14.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for Ubuntu

12.04 LTS.

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the key management subsystem in the Linux

kernel did not properly restrict adding a key that already exists but is

negatively instantiated. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2015-8539](/security/CVE-2015-8539))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the device

driver for XCeive xc2028/xc3028 tuners in the Linux kernel. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-7913](/security/CVE-2016-7913))

Pengfei Ding (丁鹏飞), Chenfu Bao (包沉浮), and Lenx Wei (韦韬)

discovered a race condition in the generic SCSI driver (sg) of the Linux

kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-0794](/security/CVE-2017-0794))

Eric Biggers discovered that the key management subsystem in the Linux

kernel did not properly restrict adding a key that already exists but is

uninstantiated. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-15299](/security/CVE-2017-15299))

It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference could be triggered in the

OCFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2017-18216](/security/CVE-2017-18216))

Luo Quan and Wei Yang discovered that a race condition existed in the

Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem of the Linux kernel when

handling ioctl()s. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system deadlock). ([CVE-2018-1000004](/security/CVE-2018-1000004))

范龙飞 discovered that a race condition existed in the Advanced Linux

Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem of the Linux kernel that could lead to

a use- after-free or an out-of-bounds buffer access. A local attacker with

access to /dev/snd/seq could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-7566](/security/CVE-2018-7566))

It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the NFC Logical Link

Control Protocol (llcp) implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-9518](/security/CVE-2018-9518))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-generic-lpae-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0.161.151](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-161.211~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-161-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-161.211~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-161.211~precise1)
* [linux-image-generic-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0.161.151](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-161.211~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-161-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-161.211~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-161.211~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A2390)

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

[Updated 16th August 2018]
The original errata text was missing reference to CVE-2018-5390 fix. We have updated the errata text to correct this issue. No changes have been made to the packages.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* Modern operating systems implement virtualization of physical memory to efficiently use available system resources and provide inter-domain protection through access control and isolation. The L1TF issue was found in the way the x86 microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions (a commonly used performance optimisation) in combination with handling of page-faults caused by terminated virtual to physical address resolving process. As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read privileged memory of the kernel or other processes and/or cross guest/host boundaries to read host memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3620, CVE-2018-3646)
* An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions past bounds check. The flaw relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code and the fact that memory writes occur to an address which depends on the untrusted value. Such writes cause an update into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to influence speculative execution and/or read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3693)
* A flaw named SegmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled specially crafted TCP packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive calls to tcp\_collapse\_ofo\_queue() and tcp\_prune\_ofo\_queue() functions by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions which could lead to a CPU saturation and hence a denial of service on the system. Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable open port, thus the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses. (CVE-2018-5390)
* kernel: kvm: vmx: host GDT limit corruption (CVE-2018-10901)
* kernel: Use-after-free in snd\_pcm\_info function in ALSA subsystem potentially leads to privilege escalation (CVE-2017-0861)
* kernel: Use-after-free in snd\_seq\_ioctl\_create\_port() (CVE-2017-15265)
* kernel: race condition in snd\_seq\_write() may lead to UAF or OOB-access (CVE-2018-7566)
* kernel: Race condition in sound system can lead to denial of service (CVE-2018-1000004)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Intel OSSIRT (Intel.com) for reporting CVE-2018-3620 and CVE-2018-3646; Vladimir Kiriansky (MIT) and Carl Waldspurger (Carl Waldspurger Consulting) for reporting CVE-2018-3693; Juha-Matti Tilli (Aalto University, Department of Communications and Networking and Nokia Bell Labs) for reporting CVE-2018-5390; and Vegard Nossum (Oracle Corporation) for reporting CVE-2018-10901.

Bug Fix(es):

* The Least recently used (LRU) operations are batched by caching pages in per-cpu page vectors to prevent contention of the heavily used lru\_lock spinlock. The page vectors can hold even the compound pages. Previously, the page vectors were cleared only if they were full. Subsequently, the amount of memory held in page vectors, which is not reclaimable, was sometimes too high. Consequently the page reclamation started the Out of Memory (OOM) killing processes. With this update, the underlying source code has been fixed to clear LRU page vectors each time when a compound page is added to them. As a result, OOM killing processes due to high amounts of memory held in page vectors no longer occur. (BZ#1575819)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

# USN-3631-2: Linux kernel (Xenial HWE) vulnerabilities

24 April 2018

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-3631-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu

14.04 LTS.

It was discovered that a buffer overread vulnerability existed in the

keyring subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use

this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2017-13305](/security/CVE-2017-13305))

It was discovered that the DM04/QQBOX USB driver in the Linux kernel did

not properly handle device attachment and warm-start. A physically

proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-16538](/security/CVE-2017-16538))

Luo Quan and Wei Yang discovered that a race condition existed in the

Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem of the Linux kernel when

handling ioctl()s. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system deadlock). ([CVE-2018-1000004](/security/CVE-2018-1000004))

Wang Qize discovered that an information disclosure vulnerability existed

in the SMBus driver for ACPI Embedded Controllers in the Linux kernel. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel

pointer addresses). ([CVE-2018-5750](/security/CVE-2018-5750))

范龙飞 discovered that a race condition existed in the Advanced Linux

Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem of the Linux kernel that could lead to

a use-after-free or an out-of-bounds buffer access. A local attacker with

access to /dev/snd/seq could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-7566](/security/CVE-2018-7566))

### Reduce your security exposure

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

The new kernel version is based on an upstream Linux kernel version 4.11. The offering is distributed with other updated packages, but most of the userspace is the standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Server RPM files.  For more information please refer to:  <https://access.redhat.com/articles/3158541> <https://access.redhat.com/articles/3158511>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1535315#c11)  Adam Mariš    2018-02-19 09:47:23 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the version of Linux kernel package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. This is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates of the product due to its life cycle. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/>.  This issue affects the versions of the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, its real-time kernel, Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 for ARM 64 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 for Power 9 LE. Future Linux kernel updates for the respective releases may address this issue.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1535315#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-04-10 05:12:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:0654 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0654](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A0654)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1535315#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-04-10 08:17:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:0676 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0676](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A0676)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1535315#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-04-10 09:41:47 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2018:1062 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:1062](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A1062)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1535315#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2018-08-14 18:25:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2018:2390 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2390](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018%3A2390)   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1535315#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-06-17 19:09:06 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2019:1483 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1483](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1483)   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1535315#c19)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-06-17 19:56:22 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2  Via RHSA-2019:1487 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1487](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1487)   ``` |  |

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's networking subsystem processed TCP Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) segments. While processing SACK segments, the Linux kernel's socket buffer (SKB) data structure becomes fragmented. Each fragment is about TCP maximum segment size (MSS) bytes. To efficiently process SACK blocks, the Linux kernel merges multiple fragmented SKBs into one, potentially overflowing the variable holding the number of segments. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the Linux kernel by sending a crafted sequence of SACK segments on a TCP connection with small value of TCP MSS, resulting in a denial of service (DoS). (CVE-2019-11477)
* kernel: race condition in snd\_seq\_write() may lead to UAF or OOB-access (CVE-2018-7566)
* kernel: Race condition in sound system can lead to denial of service (CVE-2018-1000004)
* Kernel: tcp: excessive resource consumption while processing SACK blocks allows remote denial of service (CVE-2019-11478)
* Kernel: tcp: excessive resource consumption for TCP connections with low MSS allows remote denial of service (CVE-2019-11479)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Bug Fix(es):

* Mistmach between 'tty->termios->c\_lflag' and 'ldata->icanon' for 'ICANON' (BZ#1708061)
* RHEL7: rwsem reader/writer mutual exclusion guarantee may not work (BZ#1709702)
* hardened usercopy is causing crash (BZ#1712311)
* [RHEL7] md\_clear flag missing from /proc/cpuinfo on late microcode update (BZ#1712991)
* [RHEL7] MDS mitigations are not enabled after double microcode update (BZ#1712996)
* WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 0 at kernel/jump\_label.c:90 \_\_static\_key\_slow\_dec+0xa6/0xb0 (BZ#1713002)
* [debug kernel] [x86\_64]INFO: possible circular locking dependency detected (BZ#1715326)
* RHEL-7.7: tty: termios\_rwsem possible deadlock (BZ#1715329)

Enhancement(s):

* [MCHP 7.7 FEAT] Update smartpqi driver to latest upstream (BZ#1709467)

## Solution

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a

Debian Bug     : 887106

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2017-0861

    Robb Glasser reported a potential use-after-free in the ALSA (sound)
    PCM core.  We believe this was not possible in practice.

CVE-2017-5715

    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
    processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
    controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes
    running on the system.

    This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 2 (branch
    target injection) and is mitigated for the x86 architecture (amd64
    and i386) by using the "retpoline" compiler feature which allows
    indirect branches to be isolated from speculative execution.

CVE-2017-13166

    A bug in the 32-bit compatibility layer of the v4l2 ioctl handling
    code has been found.  Memory protections ensuring user-provided
    buffers always point to userland memory were disabled, allowing
    destination addresses to be in kernel space.  On a 64-bit kernel
    (amd64 flavour) a local user with access to a suitable video
    device can exploit this to overwrite kernel memory, leading to
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2017-16526

    Andrey Konovalov reported that the UWB subsystem may dereference
    an invalid pointer in an error case.  A local user might be able
    to use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-16911

    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP vhci_hcd driver exposed
    kernel heap addresses to local users.  This information could aid the
    exploitation of other vulnerabilities.

CVE-2017-16912

    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver failed to
    perform a range check on a received packet header field, leading
    to an out-of-bounds read.  A remote user able to connect to the
    USB/IP server could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-16913

    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver failed to
    perform a range check on a received packet header field, leading
    to excessive memory allocation.  A remote user able to connect to
    the USB/IP server could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-16914

    Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver failed to
    check for an invalid combination of fields in a recieved packet,
    leading to a null pointer dereference.  A remote user able to
    connect to the USB/IP server could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-18017

    Denys Fedoryshchenko reported that the netfilter xt_TCPMSS module
    failed to validate TCP header lengths, potentially leading to a
    use-after-free.  If this module is loaded, it could be used by a
    remote attacker for denial of service or possibly for code
    execution.

CVE-2017-18203

    Hou Tao reported that there was a race condition in creation and
    deletion of device-mapper (DM) devices.  A local user could
    potentially use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-18216

    Alex Chen reported that the OCFS2 filesystem failed to hold a
    necessary lock during nodemanager sysfs file operations,
    potentially leading to a null pointer dereference.  A local user
    could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-1068

    The syzkaller tool found that the 32-bit compatibility layer of
    ebtables did not sufficiently validate offset values.  On a 64-bit
    kernel (amd64 flavour), a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability could use this to overwrite kernel memory, possibly
    leading to privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-1092

    Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image would
    trigger a null dereference when mounted.  A local user able
    to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this for denial of
    service.

CVE-2018-5332

    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not
    sufficiently validate RDMA requests, leading to an out-of-bounds
    write.  A local attacker on a system with the rds module loaded
    could use this for denial of service or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2018-5333

    Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not properly
    handle an error case, leading to a null pointer dereference.  A
    local attacker on a system with the rds module loaded could
    possibly use this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-5750

    Wang Qize reported that the ACPI sbshc driver logged a kernel heap
    address.  This information could aid the exploitation of other
    vulnerabilities.

CVE-2018-5803

    Alexey Kodanev reported that the SCTP protocol did not range-check
    the length of chunks to be created.  A local or remote user could
    use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2018-6927

    Li Jinyue reported that the FUTEX_REQUEUE operation on futexes did
    not check for negative parameter values, which might lead to a
    denial of service or other security impact.

CVE-2018-7492

    The syzkaller tool found that the RDS protocol was lacking a null
    pointer check.  A local attacker on a system with the rds module
    loaded could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-7566

    范龙飞 (Fan LongFei) reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound)
    sequencer core, between write and ioctl operations.  This could
    lead to an out-of-bounds access or use-after-free.  A local user
    with access to a sequencer device could use this for denial of
    service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-7740

    Nic Losby reported that the hugetlbfs filesystem's mmap operation
    did not properly range-check the file offset.  A local user with
    access to files on a hugetlbfs filesystem could use this to cause
    a denial of service.

CVE-2018-7757

    Jason Yan reported a memory leak in the SAS (Serial-Attached
    SCSI) subsystem.  A local user on a system with SAS devices
    could use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2018-7995

    Seunghun Han reported a race condition in the x86 MCE
    (Machine Check Exception) driver.  This is unlikely to have
    any security impact.

CVE-2018-8781

    Eyal Itkin reported that the udl (DisplayLink) driver's mmap
    operation did not properly range-check the file offset.  A local
    user with access to a udl framebuffer device could exploit this to
    overwrite kernel memory, leading to privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-8822

    Dr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported that the ncpfs client
    implementation did not validate reply lengths from the server.  An
    ncpfs server could use this to cause a denial of service or
    remote code execution in the client.

CVE-2018-1000004

    Luo Quan reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound) sequencer
    core, between multiple ioctl operations.  This could lead to a
    deadlock or use-after-free.  A local user with access to a
    sequencer device could use this for denial of service or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-1000199

    Andy Lutomirski discovered that the ptrace subsystem did not
    sufficiently validate hardware breakpoint settings.  Local users
    can use this to cause a denial of service, or possibly for
    privilege escalation, on x86 (amd64 and i386) and possibly other
    architectures.

Additionally, some mitigations for CVE-2017-5753 are included in this
release:

CVE-2017-5753

    Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
    processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
    controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes
    running on the system.

    This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 1
    (bounds-check bypass) and is mitigated by identifying vulnerable
    code sections (array bounds checking followed by array access) and
    replacing the array access with the speculation-safe
    array_index_nospec() function.

    More use sites will be added over time.

For Debian 7 "Wheezy", these problems have been fixed in version
3.2.101-1.  This version also includes bug fixes from upstream versions
up to and including 3.2.101.  It also fixes a regression in the
procfs hidepid option in the previous version (Debian bug #887106).

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

## Details

It was discovered that a buffer overread vulnerability existed in the

keyring subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use

this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2017-13305](/security/CVE-2017-13305))

It was discovered that the DM04/QQBOX USB driver in the Linux kernel did

not properly handle device attachment and warm-start. A physically

proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-16538](/security/CVE-2017-16538))

Luo Quan and Wei Yang discovered that a race condition existed in the

Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem of the Linux kernel when

handling ioctl()s. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system deadlock). ([CVE-2018-1000004](/security/CVE-2018-1000004))

Wang Qize discovered that an information disclosure vulnerability existed

in the SMBus driver for ACPI Embedded Controllers in the Linux kernel. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel

pointer addresses). ([CVE-2018-5750](/security/CVE-2018-5750))

范龙飞 discovered that a race condition existed in the Advanced Linux

Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem of the Linux kernel that could lead to

a use-after-free or an out-of-bounds buffer access. A local attacker with

access to /dev/snd/seq could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-7566](/security/CVE-2018-7566))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2018%3A0654)

## Topic

An update for kernel-alt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-alt packages provide the Linux kernel version 4.x.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: kernel-alt (4.14.0). (BZ#1492717)

Security Fix(es):

* An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). There are three primary variants of the issue which differ in the way the speculative execution can be exploited.

Variant CVE-2017-5715 triggers the speculative execution by utilizing branch target injection. It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory accesses may cause allocation into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to cross the syscall and guest/host boundaries and read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2017-5715, Important, ARM)

Variant CVE-2017-5753 triggers the speculative execution by performing a bounds-check bypass. It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory accesses may cause allocation into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to cross the syscall boundary and read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2017-5753, Important, ARM)

Variant CVE-2017-5754 relies on the fact that, on impacted microprocessors, during speculative execution of instruction permission faults, exception generation triggered by a faulting access is suppressed until the retirement of the whole instruction block. In a combination with the fact that memory accesses may populate the cache even when the block is being dropped and never committed (executed), an unprivileged local attacker could use this flaw to read privileged (kernel space) memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2017-5754, Important, ARM)

* kernel: memory leak when merging buffers in SCSI IO vectors (CVE-2017-12190, Moderate)
* kernel: net: double-free and memory corruption in get\_net\_ns\_by\_id() (CVE-2017-15129, Moderate)
* kernel: Incorrect updates of uninstantiated keys crash the kernel (CVE-2017-15299, Moderate)
* kernel: Missing capabilities check in net/netfilter/nfnetlink\_cthelper.c allows for unprivileged access to systemwide nfnl\_cthelper\_list structure (CVE-2017-17448, Moderate)
* kernel: Missing namespace check in net/netlink/af\_netlink.c allows for network monitors to observe systemwide activity (CVE-2017-17449, Moderate)
* kernel: Arbitrary stack overwrite causing oops via crafted signal frame (CVE-2017-1000255, Moderate)
* kernel: Stack information leak in the EFS element (CVE-2017-1000410, Moderate)
* kernel: Race condition in sound system can lead to denial of service (CVE-2018-1000004, Moderate)
* kernel: Buffer overflow in mp\_override\_legacy\_irq() (CVE-2017-11473, Low)
* kernel: Integer overflow in futex.c:futux\_requeue can lead to denial of service or unspecified impact (CVE-2018-6927, Low)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Red Hat would like to thank Google Project Zero for reporting CVE-2017-5715, CVE-2017-5753, and CVE-2017-5754; Vitaly Mayatskih for reporting CVE-2017-12190; Kirill Tkhai for reporting CVE-2017-15129; Michael Ellerman, Gustavo Romero, Breno Leitao, Paul Mackerras, and Cyril Bur for reporting CVE-2017-1000255; and Armis Labs for reporting CVE-2017-1000410.

PRODUCT： linux kernel
VERSION：   Most versions.some deadlock ,some uaf.2.6。I tested 2.6 versions, 3.10 versions, and 4.12
PROBLEMTYPE:  deadlock  or uaf
REFERENCES：<https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/b3defb791b26ea0683a93a4f49c77ec45ec96f10>
DESCRIPTION：
This vulnerability, which belong to UAF caused by race conditions,
can impact the majority of linux distribution(audio system).

In file seq_clientmgr.c, function snd_seq_write and
snd_seq_ioctl_set_client_pool can cause conditional competition problems
when multi-thread is used.

snd_seq_write calls snd_seq_cell_alloc to allocate memories for cell from
client->pool. When pool is exhausted, schedule is called to switch current
thread to another thread, and add current thread to a queue for waiting.

snd_seq_ioctl_set_client_pool calls snd_seq_pool_mark_closing to set
client->pool->closeing to 1, in order to prevent re-entrant. It also
calls snd_seq_queue_client_leave_cells to release cell. And it then calls
snd_seq_pool_done, first to release pool and allocate new pool and second
to set client->pool->closeing to 0. Function wake_up is both called in
snd_seq_queue_client_leave_cells and snd_seq_pool_done, to wake up the
thread in the waiting queue mentioned above, avoiding the use of any
wild pointer.

All is seemed to be well designed , but there is a trick:

-- Thread A --
step 1:
A calls snd_seq_write to exhaust pool.

step 2:
snd_seq_write calls func schedule to schedule threads, now go to Thread B.

-- Thread B --
step 1:
B calls snd_seq_ioctl_set_client_pool.

step 2:
snd_seq_ioctl_set_client_pool calls snd_seq_pool_mark_closing.
snd_seq_pool_mark_closing sets client->pool->closeing to 1.

step 3:
Then snd_seq_ioctl_set_client_pool calls snd_seq_queue_client_leave_cells.
snd_seq_queue_client_leave_cells release the memories of cells.
snd_seq_queue_client_leave_cells calls wake_up, now back to Thread A.

-- Back To Thread A --
step 1:
A will find out that client->pool->closeing is 1, so snd_seq_cell_alloc fails.

step 2:
Returning from snd_seq_cell_alloc to snd_seq_write. snd_seq_write also fails.

step 3:
A now call snd_seq_ioctl_set_client_pool.

step 4:
snd_seq_ioctl_set_client_pool calls snd_seq_pool_mark_closing.
snd_seq_pool_mark_closing sets client->pool->closeing to 1 again.

step 5:
Then snd_seq_ioctl_set_client_pool calls snd_seq_queue_client_leave_cells.
cell is already release by B.
And because no thread is in waiting queue, so wake_up will not be called.

step 6:
Then snd_seq_ioctl_set_client_pool calls snd_seq_pool_done.
snd_seq_pool_done release pool and allocate new pool.
snd_seq_pool_done sets client->pool->closeing to 0.
Now it's become reentrant.

step 8:
So after a call to snd_seq_ioctl_set_client_pool, pool is new.
Thread A can call snd_seq_write many times to exhaust the memories of pool.
Then A go to sleep, now switch to thread B.

-- Back To Thread B --
step 1:
Back to snd_seq_queue_client_leave_cells, after previous call to wake_up.

step 2:
Return to snd_seq_ioctl_set_client_pool.
snd_seq_ioctl_set_client_pool call snd_seq_pool_done.
snd_seq_pool_done release and allocate new pool.
now client->pool->closeing is already 0, and pool is new.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Now you see, the pool allocated by thread A is now released by thread B.
And thread B allocate new pool, which is the 3rd pool.

But in thread A, in snd_seq_cell_alloc called by snd_seq_write, the pool is
actually the 2cd pool, and meet a dead loop:

while (pool->free == NULL && ! nonblock && ! pool->closing)

Note the 2cd pool is released by thread B in B's snd_seq_ioctl_set_client_pool.

Further more, if serveral threads switch between sechedule and wake_up, there will be more obvious sequelae.

----------------------------------------------------

call stack:

thread a:
-> snd_seq_write
   -> snd_seq_client_enqueue_event
      -> snd_seq_event_dup
         -> snd_seq_cell_alloc
            -> schedule -> thread b

thread b:
-> snd_seq_ioctl_set_client_pool
   -> snd_seq_pool_mark_closing    (set closeing to 1)
   -> snd_seq_queue_client_leave_cells  (release cell)
      -> wake_up -> thread a

thread a:
-> snd_seq_ioctl_set_client_pool
   -> snd_seq_pool_mark_closing    (set closeing to 1 again)
   -> snd_seq_queue_client_leave_cells  (already release cell by thread b)
   -> snd_seq_pool_done    (release pool and allocate new pool, 2cd pool;
                            set closeing to 0)
-> snd_seq_write
   -> snd_seq_client_enqueue_event
      -> snd_seq_event_dup
         -> snd_seq_cell_alloc
            -> schedule -> thread b

thread b:
   back to snd_seq_queue_client_leave_cells, after func wake_up
   -> snd_seq_queue_client_leave_cells
   -> snd_seq_pool_done    (release pool and allocate new pool, 3rd pool;
                            set closeing to 0)
      (leave 2cd pool's cell unhandled)
      -> wake_up -> thread a:

thread a:
-> snd_seq_cell_alloc:
   while (pool->free == NULL && ! nonblock && ! pool->closing)
   meet dead loop, now pool in thread a is the 2cd pool, has been released,
   now is a wild pointer.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the key management subsystem in the Linux

kernel did not properly restrict adding a key that already exists but is

negatively instantiated. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2015-8539](/security/CVE-2015-8539))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the device

driver for XCeive xc2028/xc3028 tuners in the Linux kernel. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-7913](/security/CVE-2016-7913))

Pengfei Ding (丁鹏飞), Chenfu Bao (包沉浮), and Lenx Wei (韦韬)

discovered a race condition in the generic SCSI driver (sg) of the Linux

kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-0794](/security/CVE-2017-0794))

Eric Biggers discovered that the key management subsystem in the Linux

kernel did not properly restrict adding a key that already exists but is

uninstantiated. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-15299](/security/CVE-2017-15299))

It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference could be triggered in the

OCFS2 file system implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2017-18216](/security/CVE-2017-18216))

Luo Quan and Wei Yang discovered that a race condition existed in the

Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem of the Linux kernel when

handling ioctl()s. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system deadlock). ([CVE-2018-1000004](/security/CVE-2018-1000004))

范龙飞 discovered that a race condition existed in the Advanced Linux

Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem of the Linux kernel that could lead to

a use- after-free or an out-of-bounds buffer access. A local attacker with

access to /dev/snd/seq could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-7566](/security/CVE-2018-7566))

It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the NFC Logical Link

Control Protocol (llcp) implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-9518](/security/CVE-2018-9518))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

* Overview

Red Hat has been made aware of a new computer microprocessor hardware implementation (microarchitecture) issue similar to Spectre and Meltdown which has been reported to affect x86 microprocessors manufactured by Intel. Unprivileged attackers can use this flaw to bypass memory security restrictions in order to gain access to data stored in memory that would otherwise be inaccessible.  There are three pieces to this vulnerability. The first affects only Intel “SGX” secure enclaves and is mitigated through microcode updates independently of the operating system. The other two pieces require software-level mitigations performed by operating systems and hypervisors. Full mitigation from potential attack by untrusted guest virtual machines in an environment using virtualization will require specific action by a system administrator.

[CVE-2018-3620](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-3620) is the CVE identifier assigned to the operating system vulnerability for this issue. [CVE-2018-3646](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-3646) is the CVE identifier assigned to the virtualization aspect of the flaw. This issue is referred to as L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF) by the larger industry and as “Foreshadow” by the security researcher.

The L1 Terminal Fault vulnerability allows a malicious actor to bypass memory access security controls ordinarily imposed and managed by the operating system or hypervisor. An attacker can use this vulnerability to read any physical memory location that is cached in the [L1 data cache](https://access.redhat.com/bounce/?externalURL=https%3A%2F%2Flwn.net%2FArticles%2F252125%2F) of the processor. Normally, operating system and hypervisor managed “page tables” provide information to the processor about which memory locations should be accessible to an application, the operating system kernel itself, and guest virtual machine instances. These page tables are formed from page table entries (PTEs) that include a “present” bit indicating validity. In exploiting L1TF, an attacker abuses the Intel processor logic that recognizes valid PTEs.

The L1 data cache (typically 32KB in size) is the first level of a fast on-chip processor memory hierarchy that contains copies of data also held in the external (to the processor) main memory chips. Caches are populated as memory is used by programs, and are typically separated into multiple levels. A small and fast highest level (L1) cache is closest to the processor functional units that perform the actual calculations within a program, while progressively larger and slower caches are located conceptually further away. The L1 is shared between two peer hyperthreads within an Intel processor core. Each core also has a slightly larger L2 cache. The L3 (also called an LLC or Last Level Cache) is shared by all of the cores within the processor and is much larger (e.g. 32MB). Data moves from memory, to the L3, and toward the L1 when it is used.

Accesses to the cache memory within the processor chip are orders of magnitude faster than going out to main memory, so it is used to significantly enhance performance. The data cache is also populated as a side-effect of operations performed during speculative or Out-of-Order execution. As a result of this relative difference in the performance of the caches as compared with memory, it is possible for malicious software code to infer cache activity. This is known as side-channel analysis, and was popularized by Meltdown and Spectre. In those vulnerabilities, as in L1TF, specific software sequences, known as “gadgets” can be created that exploit a vulnerable processor to cause observable cache activity during speculation.

L1TF is similar to Meltdown, insomuch that it exploits how vulnerable processors implement a form of speculation, in this case during the searching of page tables (known as a table walk). The processor is designed to yield the most aggressive performance possible, so it speculates that page table entries are valid and permit access to the underlying memory location prior to completing the necessary validity checks. The processor will preemptively search its L1 data cache for any physical address matching bits in the page table entry, forwarding any match to dependent speculative operations. After a small time, the processor will detect that the page table entry is not valid and signal an internal “terminal fault”. The processor then unwinds (throws away) previously speculated results, but observable impact upon the cache remains.

In the case of virtualized guest instances, the L1TF vulnerability manifests because of an aspect of the implementation of a technology within Intel processors known as “Extended Page Tables” (EPT). This hardware performance feature allows hypervisors (such as KVM) to delegate part of the management of page tables to guest virtual machines. Each memory access is subject to two translations - first by the guest, and then by the host page tables. This saves the overhead caused by repeated assistance from the hypervisor, which used to be required prior to EPT. In vulnerable implementations, a malicious guest is able to create a “not present” page table entry that will shortcut the normal two stages of translation, resulting in the guest being able to read host hypervisor or other guest physical memory if a copy exists in the L1 data cache.

There are two attack patterns that end-users will need to protect against: a malicious user on a system reading data on the physical system or a malicious guest OS or container accessing information from other guests or the host. This vulnerability is similar to [CVE-2017-5754](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-5754) (aka “Meltdown”) but exploits an interaction between the Memory Management Unit (MMU) and the L1 Data Cache under speculation when performing virtual to physical memory address translation. Existing mitigations for previous microarchitectural vulnerabilities (“Meltdown,” aka “Variant 3”) are not sufficient to protect against this new vulnerability.

Red Hat strongly recommends that customers take corrective  actions, including manually enabling specific kernel parameters or potentially disabling features like Intel Hyper-Threading, after the available updates have been applied. More details can be found in the Mitigations section of this article.

## Background Information

Modern operating systems implement a ‘virtual memory’ scheme to efficiently use available main memory across multiple tasks/processes. Physical systems have fixed amounts of main memory which form the **physical address** space. This address space is divided into smaller managed units known as pages (e.g. 4KB). The operating system creates **virtual address** spaces for each running program (known as a process). Each virtual address is translated into an underlying physical address using a special piece of hardware within the processor, known as the Memory Management Unit (MMU). When a processor schedules a program for execution, its instructions and data are mapped into virtual addresses. Programs use virtual addresses to reference memory locations. The processor’s MMU uses a concept known as **Paging** to perform the translation between virtual addresses and their underlying mapped physical memory addresses.

![](https://access.redhat.com/sites/default/files/l1tf1_0.png)

The **Paging** technique translates each virtual address to a physical address by using hierarchical paging structures known as page tables. These translate portions of the virtual address using bits from the address as indexes into components of the page tables. Page tables are built from fixed size records/entries which hold a physical address pointing to either another paging structure entry or the mapped memory page. Along with the physical address, a paging structure entry also holds various attribute bits about the physical address. These include a bit indicating whether the page is present (**P flag**) in the physical memory or not (swapped out). A page table entry marked as not present is supposed to be ignored by the processor MMU logic.

##### Page Structure Entry:

The Intel Software Developers Manual (Volume 3, Chapter 4) defines the hardware paging structures used by Intel processors, including the 64-bit Page Table Entry (PTE) used to store the physical address during a virtual to physical address translation.

![](https://access.redhat.com/sites/default/files/l1ft2-2.png)

During address translation, the processor will walk through the page table structures, ultimately arriving upon a Page Table Entry that contains a possible physical translation for a particular virtual address. This address translation process terminates when the virtual address resolves to a mapped page frame in the physical memory OR when a paging structure entry indicates that the required page frame is **not present (P flag(bit zero) = 0)** in the main memory OR it has **reserved bits set**. Accessing the physical address from such an entry results in the page-fault exception (aka “terminal fault”).

While Red Hat's Linux Containers are not directly impacted by kernel issues, their security relies upon the integrity of the host kernel environment. Red Hat recommends that you use the most recent versions of your container images. The Container Health Index, part of the [Red Hat Container Catalog](https://access.redhat.com/containers/), can always be used to verify the security status of Red Hat containers. To protect the privacy of the containers in use, you will need to ensure that the Container host (such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux or [Atomic Host](https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/enterprise-linux-atomic-host-datasheet)) has been updated against these attacks. Red Hat has released an updated Atomic Host for this use case.

When a processor supports speculative execution of instructions, a speculative load from a virtual address which cannot be resolved to a physical address leads to a page-fault exception during its translation process. Before this page-fault exception is delivered, speculative execution of the load instruction uses the physical address from the **not present (P flag = 0)** OR **reserved bits set** paging structure entry to access the physical memory. If the physical memory location was cached in the L1 data cache, the speculative load reads data from an inappropriate physical memory location. As a result, subsequent speculative operations use this data and can have measurable impact upon the caches that an attacker can use to read unauthorized data.

An unprivileged system user or process could exploit the L1TF vulnerability to read data from arbitrary physical memory locations of the kernel and/or other processes running on the system provided that the data is first loaded into the L1 data cache. Since loads into the L1 data cache are an intrinsic component of the processor, a malicious attacker only has to wait for a program containing secrets of interest to load those secrets while performing normal operations. This can include cryptographic keys, and other data.

### Virtualization Attack Vector:

Virtualized guest environments compound the impact from exploiting this vulnerability. In virtualized environments, guests often run an operating system which manages memory as if it were running on a bare metal host machine. What the guest operating system perceives as physical memory is in reality a virtual address space on the host, created by the Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM, e.g. KVM), also known as a hypervisor. The hypervisor introduces a layer of memory virtualization to ensure that it has control over the true host physical memory and so that it can provide isolated virtual address spaces to numerous guests while managing their access to the host physical memory. This means that virtualized environments have two levels of memory translations.

![](https://access.redhat.com/sites/default/files/l1tf3_0.png)

To facilitate efficient translation of the Guest physical addresses to Host physical addresses, hardware processors have introduced the **E**xtended **P**age **T**able (**EPT**) feature.

EPT is similar to the hierarchical Paging structures used by the host operating system to translate virtual addresses to physical memory addresses. While translating Guest physical addresses to Host physical addresses, just like page-fault exceptions on the host, **EPT Violation** exceptions cause VM exits, indicating that the given guest physical address translation can not resolve to a host physical address OR the guest does not have permissions to access the given host memory.

Similar to the host, speculative execution of instructions by a guest user can leverage those EPT violations-induced VM exits to read data from host physical memory via cache side-channel attacks. Since the guest operating system can control guest physical address bits in the EPT paging entry, a guest user can target specific host physical addresses and read data via the L1 data cache, including arbitrary host kernel memory and/or memory of the other guests/processes running on the host.

### Simultaneous Multithreading Attack Vector:

Simultaneous multithreading (SMT) allows modern processors to improve system performance by executing more than one instruction stream simultaneously on separate logical processors. i.e. the CPU creates two or more logical processors with their own set of data registers, control registers, segment registers etc. which form their architectural state. These logical processors execute separate instruction streams while sharing the same execution engine, processor caches, TLB, system bus interface, etc.
![](https://access.redhat.com/sites/default/files/l1tf4.png)

Considering that two logical processors share the processor cache, any cache manipulation operation performed by one logical processor will be visible to the other one. Ie. an application/guest running on one logical processor could leverage L1TF and speculative execution of instructions to read arbitrary memory contents of other processes and the kernel from the shared data cache.

The simultaneous nature of Intel Hyper-threading means that flushing the cache on a peer logical processor when switching virtual machine instances running on it leaves a small window of time during which secrets might be reloaded by the peer and visible to a malicious attacker running code on the other logical processor. There is currently no standard way to guarantee that this cannot happen,

As a consequence, virtualized environments should not schedule two different virtual machines to share two logical processors from a single core. In addition, when a full Linux stack is running on the host, which is able to load its own secrets in response to events such as interrupts, it is not safe to enable hyperthreading if running untrusted guests on a logical processor.

## Performance impact

Mitigating L1TF in bare metal environments that do not use virtualization has negligible performance impact and does not require specific action beyond installing the updates.

Mitigating L1TF in virtualized environments requires that the hypervisor check whether to flush the L1 data cache (L1D) of potential secrets from other virtual machines (or the host) whenever it begins running virtual machine code. Depending upon the workload, it may also be necessary to disable Intel Hyper-threading, in order to prevent a malicious virtual machine running on one hyperthread from attacking another on its peer thread.

The L1 data cache makes data available to the CPU much faster than the main memory and (almost) all data loaded from memory must pass through it. Once the L1 data cache is flushed, the CPU needs to spend hundreds of cycles to repopulate those entries from lower level caches. This is expensive in terms of time spent on data access. In terms of relative efficiency, L1 data cache takes 1x CPU cycles, while the same data access from lower level caches could take 4x CPU cycles. Data access from main memory could take 60-70x or more cycles. Since data contained within the L1 is also contained within the higher level caches, it will typically be refilled from the L2 at only modest impact to performance. This overhead also increases external interrupt and other event latency.

Similarly, Hyper-Threading (an SMT implementation) simultaneously executes more than one instruction stream to gain system performance. Disabling these threads would drop the number of logical CPUs seen by the system by half, thus significantly reducing the overall compute throughput of a system and its performance.

Note the actual performance impact of these measures is subject to the workload and can vary from one workload to another. More details about the workload specific performance impact can be seen here:   [Performance considerations for L1 Terminal Fault](https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/L1TF-perf)

## Diagnose your vulnerability

Use the detection script to determine if your system is currently vulnerable to this flaw. To verify the legitimacy of the script, you can [download the detached GPG signature](https://access.redhat.com/sites/default/files/cve-2018-3620--2021-07-19-1207.sh.asc) as well, with the signing key on our [Product Security openPGP Keys](https://access.redhat.com/security/team/key) page . The current version of the script is **1.6**.

Additonally, two Ansible playbooks are provided below. The first, *CVE-2018-3620-fix\_disable\_ht.yml*, can be applied to systems which have not been updated to address L1TF to disable Hyper-Threading without restarting the system. The playbook will make an effort to determine if the system is acting as a hypervisor and has any running VMs, but be aware that offlining Hyper-Threading can cause unexpected behavior in applications with specific core/thread affinity. If the system's kernel doesn't include the necessary features, it will fail with a message to that effect. In that case, it is recommended that you update to the latest kernel and use the second playbook, which takes advantage of L1TF-aware kernel features.

To use the *CVE-2018-3620-fix\_disable\_ht.yml* playbook, simply call ansible-playbook with the hosts you'd like to change specified in the **HOSTS** extra var:
**ansible-playbook -e "HOSTS=webservers,db01,portal" CVE-2018-3620-fix\_disable\_ht.yml**

The second playbook, *CVE-2018-3620-apply\_settings.yml*, will help you enable mitigations provided by an L1TF-aware kernel. There are three settings you can specify:

* **FLUSH=1** will change the behavior of the kernel and the kvm-intel kernel module to flush the L1 data cache on every VM enter, not just those where the kernel detects that a flush is necessary. While there are performance implications, this will provide a stronger guarantee that information isn't shared between VMs, and should prevent information leaks such as ASLR derandomization. This setting should only be necessary if you are running a hypervisor with untrusted guest systems.
* **NOSMT=1** will disable Hyper-Threading, both for the live system and at boot time. As with the first playbook, an attempt is made to determine if there are active guests to prevent offlining threads which have set affinity.
* **FORCE=1** will, when combined with **NO****SMT=1**, prevent SMT from being re-enabled at runtime via the **/sys/devices/cpu/smt/control** interface. If **FORCE** is not specified, users with sufficient permissions can re-enable or disable SMT at runtime.

Additionally, the playbook provides a **RESET=1** argument which will remove the above mitigations, and return the system to its default behavior of enabled SMT and conditional L1 data cache flushes on VM enter. A reboot is necessary after using **RESET=1**.

To use *CVE-2018-3620-apply\_settings.yml*, specify the features you want to set in extra vars, as well as the systems you'd like to target in the **HOSTS** variable. For example:

To turn off SMT, but allow runtime changes, and to leave the default behavior of conditional L1 data cache flushes:
**ansible-playbook -e "HOSTS=webservers NOSMT=1" CVE-2018-3620-apply\_settings.yml**

To apply all mitigations and prevent runtime changes:
**ansible-playbook -e "HOSTS=vmserver01 FLUSH=1 NOSMT=1 FORCE=1" CVE-2018-3620-apply\_settings.yml**

To reset the L1TF settings to their default state:
**ansible-playbook -e "HOSTS=webservers RESET=1" CVE-2018-3620-apply\_settings.yml**

## Mitigation

Current mitigations include applying vendor software updates combined with hardware OEMs CPU microcode/firmware. All Red Hat customers should apply vendor solutions to patch their CPUs, system BIOS (as needed), and update the kernel as soon as patches are available.  All mitigations are enabled by default with the exception of disabling Hyper-Threading, which customers must take explicit manual steps to turn off. Customers are advised to take a risk-based approach in reviewing and reacting to this issue. Customers will need to assess the security risk and the range of mitigations and their performance impact to create mitigation strategy.  Systems that require high degrees of security and trust should be addressed first, and should be isolated from untrusted systems until such time as treatments can be applied to those systems to reduce the risk of exploit. Customers desiring to completely mitigate this issue will need to consider more securely managing and possibly disabling Hyper-Threading to close off all attack vectors.

### Mitigation/Remediation:

Complete mitigation of the L1 Terminal Fault requires three changes; Page Table Inversion (a small change to the kernel which is provided and enabled by default in updated kernels), Flushing the L1 Data Cache when switching between virtual machines, and possibly disabling SMT. Each of these changes independently provides some protection against different parts of an attack.

Page Table Inversion (which is NOT the same as the Page Table Isolation added in mitigating Meltdown) is performed by default when manipulating not present page table entries in updated kernels provided by Red Hat.

Flushing the L1 Data Cache is optional and can be implemented by updated microcode or by the updated kernel. It is currently enabled by default when running virtualized guest machines, but can be controlled by the user through kernel parameters.

SMT Disable is optionally used to secure an untrusted shared environment running virtual machines. This is implemented through software changes to the kernel to add a new control interface. It is also possible to disable Intel Hyper-threading in the BIOS firmware, but this is much more cumbersome and is not the recommended approach.

Remediation requires this three-pronged approach because the flaw has three contributing factors:

1. Not Present (**P flag = 0**) page table entry (PTE) OR one which has **reserved bits set** holds an uninitialised physical address. And that physical address is cached into the L1 data cache.
2. Updates caused by the speculative operations to the L1 data cache are not cleared. They can be observed by a subsequent process.
3. Simultaneous multi-threads (SMT) share the execution engine and the on-chip processor caches like L1 data and TLB caches.

### Page Table Inversion:

The processor speculatively accesses physical address from a Not Present PTE and if the contents of this physical address are cached into the L1 data cache, the memory access succeeds. Therefore, if the physical address’ contents were not cached, then said memory access would not leak data. The Page Table Inversion mitigation, updates the physical address in the Not Present PTEs, by setting the high order address bits, such that it points to a physical address that is not in memory and/or is uncacheable. Thus its contents can not be present in the L1 data cache.

Updated kernel package shows the current status of the system via the sysfs interface as shown:

> # cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/l1tf
> Mitigation: PTE Inversion; VMX: SMT vulnerable, L1D conditional cache flushes
> #

### Flush L1 Data Cache:

Intel x86 processors offer a IA32\_FLUSH\_CMD Machine Specific Register (MSR), when updated microcode is installed on the system. It can be used to invalidate L1 data cache. The support for IA32\_FLUSH\_CMD MSR can be seen from /proc/cpuinfo flags OR via the lscpu(1) command which lists CPU flags:

> # lscpu
> Flags:    … ssbd ibrs ibpb stibp spec\_ctrl intel\_stibp **flush\_l1d**
> #

If **flush\_l1d** flag is not available, please confirm that you have the updated microcode installed on the system and that system has been rebooted.

In case the updated microcode is not installed, **flush\_l1d** flag will not be available. The updated kernel would still flush the L1 data cache in software. This will be slower compared to the hardware **flush\_l1d** interface.

Updated kernel package introduces the following kernel and KVM module parameters to control L1TF mitigations:

> l1tf=[full/full,force/flush/flush,nosmt/flush,nowarn/off]

This is a kernel boot parameter to control mitigation of the L1TF issue on the affected CPUs. It can take one of the following values

> full:  enables all mitigations for the L1TF issue.

* Enables L1 data cache flush on every VM entry operation.
* Disables Hyper-Threading (SMT).

Both L1 data cache flush and SMT can be controlled at run time, after boot, via the sysfs interface.

> full,force: enables all mitigations for the L1TF issue.

* Enables L1 data cache flush on every VM entry operation.
* Disables Hyper-Threading (SMT).

The force parameter here prevents users from disabling above L1TF mitigations via the sysfs interface. Users cannot enable SMT at run time.

> flush: only enable L1 data cache flush

* Enables the default L1 data cache flush mitigation, which is to conditionally flush the L1 data cache.
* Does not disable Hyper-Threading (SMT).

Both can still be controlled via the sysfs interface. The hypervisor (KVM) issues a warning if a guest is started with insecure configurations like SMT enabled OR L1 data cache flush disabled.

> flush,nosmt: disables the Hyper-Threading (SMT)

* Enable conditional L1 data cache flush mitigation.
* Disable Hyper-Threading (SMT)

Both can still be controlled via the sysfs interface. The hypervisor (KVM) issues a warning if a guest is started with insecure configurations like SMT enabled OR L1 data cache flush disabled.

> flush,nowarn: similar to the flush option above, except the KVM module warnings about guests running with insecure configurations are suppressed.

> off: disables hypervisor mitigations, ie. KVM won’t flush the L1 data cache on VM entry.

Default l1tf boot parameter value is set to the flush mitigation option above.

kvm-intel.vmentry\_l1d\_flush: KVM module parameter to control L1 data cache flush operations on each VM entry. It can have possible values as shown:

always     L1D cache flush on every VMENTER.
   cond       Conditional L1D cache flush.
   never      Disable the L1D cache flush mitigation.

cond is trying to avoid L1D cache flushes on VMENTER if the code executed between VMEXIT and VMENTER is considered safe, i.e. is not bringing any
interesting information into L1D which might be exploited.

# cat  /sys/module/kvm\_intel/parameters/vmentry\_l1d\_flush
       cond
       #

This parameter is set to cond by default; it performs an L1 Data Cache flush upon selective VM entry instances. This should help to reduce the performance impact of the L1 data cache flush.

### Control SMT:

When simultaneous multithreading or Hyper-Threading technology is in use, unrelated threads running on the same core and sharing processor cache resources can read each other’s data from the L1 data cache by leveraging the L1TF issue. If you are running an untrusted shared environment you will want to consider disabling SMT as part of your mitigation strategy. Generally SMT can be enabled or disabled from system Bios.

The updated kernel packages introduce the new command line parameter nosmt.

> nosmt: Disable simultaneous multithreading (SMT) . It can be re-enabled at run time via a sysfs interface.
>
> nosmt=force: Disable simultaneous multithreading (SMT). It can not be re-enabled at run time.

NOTE: There are controls in the kernel sysfs interface to manage multithreading at run time. Though their use can lead to erroneous behavior when SMT is re-enabled. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to use either the BIOS settings or the kernel boot parameters listed above to enable/disable SMT. The runtime flags are described here only as a reference:

> /sys/devices/system/cpu/smt/active
> /sys/devices/system/cpu/smt/control

The **active** file above is a read-only interface. When the **active** file contains ‘**1**’, it means that SMT is enabled and sibling threads are online. When the kernel is booted with the ‘**nosmt**’ parameter, it essentially writes ‘**0**’ to the **active** file above.

The control file noted above is a read/write interface to control SMT. It can have the following values:

> on             :  SMT is enabled. Enable sibling threads if they were offline.
> off            :  SMT is disabled. Disable sibling threads if they were online.
> forceoff :  SMT is forcibly disabled and cannot be changed. It cannot be
>                  Controlled or changed at run time.
> notsupported: the processor does not support Hyper-Threading (SMT).

### Disable EPT:

Disabling Extended Page Tables (EPT) for KVM guests mitigates the L1TF issue, because it essentially lets the VMM/Hypervisor manage the address translations for the guest. If EPT is disabled, one does not need to disable Hyper-Threads (SMT) and flush L1 data cache as listed above.

**Please note**: disabling EPT will significantly hamper the system performance. It may not be a viable option.

EPT can be disabled in the hypervisor via the **kvm-intel.ept** parameter. It is enabled by default.

**Red Hat recommends customers apply the microcode/firmware update provided by your hardware or CPU vendor and also install these updated kernels as soon as possible. Software updates can be applied independently from the hardware microcode, but will not take effect until the CPU firmware has been updated.**

### Tuned

The new L1TF kernels provide controls to allow the user to disable Hyper-Threading either at runtime or at kernel boot time.  If either of those two methods are used, and the system is running any one of the following four tuned profiles:

cpu-partitioning
      realtime
      realtime-virtual-host
      realtime-virtual-guest

then an updated tuned will be needed.  This only impacts RHEL 7.4z and 7.5z. An updated tuned is not needed if Hyper-Threading is disabled in the BIOS.
