An attacker must be authenticated to perform this attack.

## Where the Issue Occurred

The following code snippet shows the SQL query being created with a tainted variable:

```
$res = sqlStatement("SELECT distinct(group_name) FROM layout_options WHERE " .
                     "form_id = '".$_GET['layout_id']."' ORDER BY group_name");

```
