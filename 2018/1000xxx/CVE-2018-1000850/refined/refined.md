  "CVE-2018-1000850": {
    "description": "A directory traversal vulnerability was found in retrofit that can allow for resource manipulation. An attacker can add or remove resources which should not be available to him.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of the `@Path` parameters when `encoded=true` is set, allowing for directory traversal.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Directory traversal",
      "Resource manipulation"
     ],
    "impact": "An attacker can manipulate resources by accessing information or commands outside of set permissions. This could lead to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of resources.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted request containing path traversal sequences like `../` in the `@Path` parameters when encoded is set to true."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to an application using the vulnerable version of Retrofit, and manipulate the path parameters."
