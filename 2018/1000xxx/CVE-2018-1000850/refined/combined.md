| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1666415#c0)  Laura Pardo    2019-01-15 18:40:40 UTC  ``` FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.7 might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by leveraging failure to block the slf4j-ext class from polymorphic deserialization.   References: <https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2097> <https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-2.9.7>  Upstream Patch: <https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/87d29af25e82a249ea15858e2d4ecbf64091db44>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1666415#c1)  Laura Pardo    2019-01-15 18:40:51 UTC  ``` Created jackson-databind tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1666416](show_bug.cgi?id=1666416 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-14718 jackson-databind: arbitrary code execution in slf4j-ext class [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1666415#c10)  Doran Moppert    2019-02-08 05:30:37 UTC  ``` Statement:  This vulnerability in jackson-databind involves exploiting [CVE-2018-1088](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1088) against slf4j, which was fixed in Red Hat products through the errata referenced at <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-8088>. Applications that link only slf4j versions including that fix are not vulnerable to this vulnerability.  Red Hat Satellite 6 is not affected by this issue, since its candlepin component doesn't bundle slf4j-ext jar.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1666415#c11)  James Hebden    2019-02-14 05:18:02 UTC  ``` Even though slf4j in part of OpenDaylight-parent aggregator, the versions included are not vulnerable versions, and specifically the slf4j-ext library is not in use.   ```  [Comment

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

# Path Traversal on Retrofit

Sat, Nov 24, 2018
> **Update**: CVE created [CVE-2018-1000850](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1000850). For some reason, the wording on the CVE is quite confusing. That is not what I submitted. Hope they fix it soon.

[Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit/) is a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java developed by Square, Inc. It is a very popular library with over 30k starts in Github and more than 120 contributors.

I found a path traversal vulnerability when using `encoded=true` on `@Path` parameters. Below is an unit test reproducing the issue. This test was added on `RequestFactoryTest` class (it is not upstream though).

```
@Test public void getWithEncodedPathSegmentsSecurity() {

    class Example {
        @GET("/foo/bar/{ping}/") //
            Call<ResponseBody> method(@Path(value = "ping", encoded = true) String ping) {
            return null;
        }
    }

    Request request = buildRequest(Example.class, "../baz/pong/more");
    assertThat(request.method()).isEqualTo("GET");
    assertThat(request.headers().size()).isZero();
    assertThat(request.url().toString()).isEqualTo("http://example.com/foo/baz/pong/more/");
    assertThat(request.body()).isNull();
}
```

Given the type safety provided by the library, the issue does not affect GET requests that much. If the results returned by the path traversal are different from what was the original code was designed to parse, it will occur a deserialisation issue. For example, if the original URL was `/repository/{id}` and an attacker sends an id like `../user/1` the URL requested by retrofit will be `/user/1`. When parsing the response, Retrofit will be expecting a data structure mapping a repository not a user. Therefore, causing a deserialisation issue.

However, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`s and any requests that change the server will be affected. The deserialisation happens only after getting the response. The HTTP request at this point would have been completed and would have applied the intending effect caused by the path traversal. In the example above, if the request was a `DELETE` rather than a `GET` the attacker would have been successful in send a `DELETE` request on a user rather than a repository.

`POST` and `PUT` are not so easily exploitable, they are more dependable on the context of how they were designed. If there are two similar REST resources in the same API, it is perfectly possible to use one of the endpoints to request to `POST` or `PUT` on a different (but similar) resource.

Square has fixed the issue [here](https://github.com/square/retrofit/commit/b9a7f6ad72073ddd40254c0058710e87a073047d). Square also has released the fix on version 2.5.0. The vulnerability was introduce in a [very early commit](https://github.com/square/retrofit/commit/01d6fb1a133cea6fac18f2ef1ecab1cbee86b569). Which means all versions bellow 2.5.0 are vulnerable.

# Change Log

## [Unreleased](https://github.com/square/retrofit/compare/2.11.0...HEAD)

**New**

* First-party converters now support deferring serialization to happen when the request body is written (i.e., during HTTP execution) rather than when the HTTP request is created. In some cases this moves conversion from a calling thread to a background thread, such as in the case when using `Call.enqueue` directly.

  The following converters support this feature through a new `createStreaming()` factory:

  + Wire

**Changed**

* Nothing yet!

**Fixed**

* Nothing yet!

## [2.11.0](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/2.11.0) - 2024-03-28

**New**

* The built-in `OptionalConverterFactory` is now public to allow installing it before other converters which consume all types (e.g., Moshi, Gson, Jackson, etc.).

**Fixed**

* Ensure that exceptions thrown from failure to parse method annotations can be observed by multiple threads/callers. Previously only the first caller would see the actual parsing exception and other callers would get a cryptic `ClassCastException`.

## [2.10.0](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/2.10.0) - 2024-03-18

**New**

* Support using `Unit` as a response type. This can be used for non-body HTTP methods like `HEAD` or body-containing HTTP methods like `GET` where the body will be discarded without deserialization.
* kotlinx.serialization converter!

  This was imported from [github.com/JakeWharton/retrofit2-kotlinx-serialization-converter/](https://github.com/JakeWharton/retrofit2-kotlinx-serialization-converter/) and remains unchanged from its 1.0.0 release.

  The Maven coordinates are `com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-kotlinx-serialization`.
* JAXB 3 converter!

  The Maven coordinates are `com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-jaxb3`.
* `@Header`, `@Headers`, and `@HeaderMap` can now set non-ASCII values through the `allowUnsafeNonAsciiValues` annotation property. These are not technically compliant with the HTTP specification, but are often supported or required by services.
* Publish a BOM of all modules. The Maven coordinates are `com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit-bom`.
* `Invocation` now exposes the service `Class<?>` and the instance on which the method was invoked. This disambiguates the source when service inheritence is used.
* A response type keeper annotation processor is now available for generating shrinker rules for all referenced types in your service interface. In some cases, it's impossible for static shrinker rules to keep the entirety of what Retrofit needs at runtime. This annotation processor generates those additional rules. For more info see [its README](https://github.com/square/retrofit/tree/trunk/retrofit-response-type-keeper#readme).

**Changed**

* Add shrinker rules to retain the generic signatures of built-in types (`Call`, `Response`, etc.) which are used via reflection at runtime.
* Remove backpressure support from RxJava 2 and 3 adapters. Since we only deliver a single value and the Reactive Streams specification states that callers must request a non-zero subscription value, we never need to honor backpressure.
* Kotlin `Retrofit.create` function now has a non-null lower bound. Even if you specified a nullable type before this function would never return null.
* Suspend functions now capture and defer all `Throwable` subtypes (not just `Exception` subtypes) to avoid Java's `UndeclaredThrowableException` when thrown synchronously.
* Eagerly reject `suspend fun` functions that return `Call<Body>`. These are never correct, and should declare a return type of `Body` directly.
* Support for Java 14-specific and Java 16-specific reflection needed to invoke default methods on interfaces have been moved to separate versions of a class through a multi-release jar. This should have no observable impact other than the jar now contains classes which target Java 14 and Java 16 bytecode that might trip up some static analysis tools which are not aware of multi-release jars.
* Parameter names are now displayed in exception messages when available in the underlying Java bytecode.
* Jackson converter now supports binary formats by using byte streams rather than character streams in its implementation. Use the `create(ObjectMapper, MediaType)` overload to supply the value of the `Content-Type` header for your format.

**Fixed**

* Do not include synthetic methods when doing eager validation.
* Use per-method rather than per-class locking when parsing annotations. This eliminates contention when multiple calls are made in quick succession at the beginning of the process lifetime.

## [2.9.0](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/2.9.0) - 2020-05-20

* New: RxJava 3 adapter!

  The Maven coordinates are `com.squareup.retrofit2:adapter-rxjava3`.

  Unlike the RxJava 1 and RxJava 2 adapters, the RxJava 3 adapter's `create()` method will produce asynchronous HTTP requests by default. For synchronous requests use `createSynchronous()` and for synchronous on a scheduler use `createWithScheduler(..)`.

## [2.8.2](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/2.8.2) - 2020-05-18

* Fix: Detect running on the Android platform by using system property rather than the presence of classes.
  This ensures that even when you're running on the JVM with Android classes present on the classpath you
  get JVM semantics.
* Fix: Update to OkHttp 3.14.9 which contains an associated Android platform detection fix.

## [2.8.1](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-2.8.1) - 2020-03-25

* Fix: Do not access `MethodHandles.Lookup` on Android API 24 and 25. The class is only available
  on Android API 26 and higher.

## [2.8.0](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-2.8.0) - 2020-03-23

* New: Add `Call.timeout()` which returns the `okio.Timeout` of the full call.
* Fix: Change `Call.awaitResponse()` to accept a nullable response type.
* Fix: Support default methods on Java 14+. We had been working around a bug in earlier versions of
  Java. That bug was fixed in Java 14, and the fix broke our workaround.

## [2.7.2](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-2.7.2) - 2020-02-24

* Fix: Update to OkHttp 3.14.7 for compatibility with Android R (API 30).

## [2.7.1](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-2.7.1) - 2020-01-02

* Fix: Support 'suspend' functions in services interfaces when using 'retrofit-mock' artifact.

## [2.7.0](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-2.7.0) - 2019-12-09

**This release changes the minimum requirements to Java 8+ or Android 5+.**
See [this blog post](https://cashapp.github.io/2019-02-05/okhttp-3-13-requires-android-5) for more information on the change.

* New: Upgrade to OkHttp 3.14.4. Please see [its changelog for 3.x](https://square.github.io/okhttp/changelog_3x/).
* Fix: Allow service interfaces to extend other interfaces.
* Fix: Ensure a non-null body is returned by `Response.error`.

## [2.6.4](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-2.6.4) - 2020-01-02

* Fix: Support 'suspend' functions in services interfaces when using 'retrofit-mock' artifact.

## [2.6.3](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-2.6.3) - 2019-12-09

* Fix: Change mechanism for avoiding `UndeclaredThrowableException` in rare cases from using `yield`
  an explicit dispatch which ensures that it will work even on dispatchers which do not support yielding.

## [2.6.2](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-2.6.2) - 2019-09-23

* Fix: Avoid `IOException`s being wrapped in `UndeclaredThrowableException` in rare cases when using
  `Response<..>` as a return type for Kotlin 'suspend' functions.

## [2.6.1](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-2.6.1) - 2019-07-31

* Fix: Avoid `IOException`s being wrapped in `UndeclaredThrowableException` in rare cases.
* Fix: Include no-content `ResponseBody` for responses created by `Response.error`.
* Fix: Update embedded R8/ProGuard rules to not warn about nested classes used for Kotlin extensions.

## [2.6.0](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-2.6.0) - 2019-06-05

* New: Support `suspend` modifier on functions for Kotlin! This allows you to express the asynchrony of HTTP requests
  in an idiomatic fashion for the language.

  ```
  @GET("users/{id}")
  suspend fun user(@Path("id") id: Long): User
  ```

  Behind the scenes this behaves as if defined as `fun user(...): Call<User>` and then invoked with `Call.enqueue`.
  You can also return `Response<User>` for access to the response metadata.

  Currently this integration only supports non-null response body types. Follow
  [issue 3075](https://github.com/square/retrofit/issues/3075) for nullable type support.
* New: **`@Tag`** parameter annotation for setting tags on the underlying OkHttp `Request` object. These can be read
  in `CallAdapter`s or OkHttp `Interceptor`s for tracing, analytics, varying behavior, and more.
* New: **`@SkipCallbackExecutor`** method annotation will result in your `Call` invoking its `Callback` on the
  background thread on which the HTTP call was made.
* New: Support OkHttp's `Headers` type for `@HeaderMap` parameters.
* New: Add `Retrofit.Builder.baseUrl(URL)` overload.
* Fix: Add embedded R8/ProGuard rule which retains Retrofit interfaces (while still allowing obfuscation). This
  is needed because R8 running in 'full mode' (i.e., not in ProGuard-compatibility mode) will see that there are
  no subtypes of these interfaces and rewrite any code which references instances to null.
* Fix: Mark `HttpException.response()` as `@Nullable` as serializing the exception does not retain this instance.
* Fix: Fatal errors (such as stack overflows, out of memory, etc.) now propagate to the OkHttp `Dispatcher` thread
  on which they are running.
* Fix: Ensure JAX-B converter closes the response body when an exception is thrown during deserialization.
* Fix: Ignore static methods when performing eager validation of interface methods.
* Fix: Ensure that calling `source()` twice on the `ResponseBody` passed to a `Converter` always returns the same
  instance. Prior to the fix, intermediate buffering would cause response data to be lost.

## [2.5.0](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-2.5.0) - 2018-11-18

* New: Built-in support for Kotlin's `Unit` type. This behaves the same as Java's `Void` where the body
  content is ignored and immediately discarded.
* New: Built-in support for Java 8's `Optional` and `CompletableFuture` types. Previously the 'converter-java8'
  and 'adapter-java8' dependencies were needed and explicitly adding `Java8OptionalConverterFactory` and/or
  `Java8CallAdapterFactory` to your `Retrofit.Builder` in order to use these types. Support is now built-in and
  those types and their artifacts are marked as deprecated.
* New: `Invocation` class provides a reference to the invoked method and argument list as a tag on the
  underlying OkHttp `Call`. This can be accessed from an OkHttp interceptor for things like logging, analytics,
  or metrics aggregation.
* New: Kotlin extension for `Retrofit` which allows you call `create` passing the interface type only as
  a generic parameter (e.g., `retrofit.create<MyService>()`).
* New: Added `Response.success` overload which allows specifying a custom 2xx status code.
* New: Added `Calls.failure` overload which allows passing any `Throwable` subtype.
* New: Minimal R8 rules now ship inside the jar requiring no client configuration in the common case.
* Fix: Do not propagate fatal errors to the callback. They are sent to the thread's uncaught
  exception handler.
* Fix: Do not enqueue/execute an otherwise useless call when the RxJava type is disposed by `onSubscribe`.
* Fix: Call `RxJavaPlugins` assembly hook when creating an RxJava 2 type.
* Fix: Ensure both the Guava and Java 8 `Optional` converters delegate properly. This ensures that converters
  registered prior to the optional converter can be used for deserializing the body type.
* Fix: Prevent `@Path` values from participating in path-traversal. This ensures untrusted input passed as
  a path value cannot cause you to make a request to an un-intended relative URL.
* Fix: Simple XML converter (which is deprecated) no longer wraps subtypes of `RuntimeException`
  or `IOException` when it fails.
* Fix: Prevent JAXB converter from loading remote entities and DTDs.
* Fix: Correctly detect default methods in interfaces on Android (API 24+). These still do not work, but
  now a correct exception will be thrown when detected.
* Fix: Report more accurate exceptions when a `@QueryName` or `@QueryMap` precedes a `@Url` parameter.
* Update OkHttp dependency to 3.12.

## [2.4.0](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-2.4.0) - 2018-03-14

* New: `Retrofit.Builder` exposes mutable lists of the added converter and call adapter factories.
* New: Call adapter added for Scala's `Future`.
* New: Converter for JAXB replaces the now-deprecated converter for Simple XML Framework.
* New: Add Java 9 automatic module names for each artifact corresponding to their root package.
* Fix: Do not swallow `Error`s from callbacks (usually `OutOfMemoryError`).
* Fix: Moshi and Gson converters now assert that the full response was consumed. This prevents
  hiding bugs in faulty adapters which might not have consumed the full JSON input which would
  then cause failures on the next request over that connection.
* Fix: Do not conflate OkHttp `Call` cancelation with RxJava unsubscription/disposal. Prior to
  this change, canceling of a `Call` would prevent a cancelation exception from propagating down
  the Rx stream.

## [2.3.0](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-2.3.0) - 2017-05-13

* **Retrofit now uses `@Nullable` to annotate all possibly-null values.** We've
  added a compile-time dependency on the JSR 305 annotations. This is a
  [provided](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html) dependency and does not need to be included in
  your build configuration, `.jar` file, or `.apk`. We use
  `@ParametersAreNonnullByDefault` and all parameters and return types are
  never null unless explicitly annotated `@Nullable`.

  **Warning: this release is source-incompatible for Kotlin users.**
  Nullability was previously ambiguous and lenient but now the compiler will
  enforce strict null checks.
* New: Converters added for Java 8's and Guava's `Optional` which wrap a potentially-nullable
  response body. These converters still rely on normal serialization library converters for parsing
  the response bytes into an object.
* New: String converters that return `null` for an `@Query` or `@Field` parameter are now skipped.
* New: The mock module's `NetworkBehavior` now throws a custom subclass of `IOException` to more
  clearly indicate the exception's source.
* RxJava 1.x converter updated to 1.3.0 which stabilizes the use of `Completable`.
* Fix: Add explicit handling for `OnCompleteFailedException`, `OnErrorFailedException`, and
  `OnErrorNotImplementedException` for RxJava 1.x to ensure they're correct delivered to the
  plugins/hooks for handling.
* Fix: `NoSuchElementException` thrown when unsubscribing from an RxJava 1.x `Single`.

## [2.2.0](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-2.2.0) - 2017-02-21

* RxJava 2.x is now supported with a first-party 'adapter-rxjava2' artifact.
* New: `@QueryName` annotation allows creating a query parameter with no '=' separator or value.
* New: Support for messages generated by Protobuf 3.0 or newer when using the converter for Google's
  protobuf.
* New: RxJava 1.x call adapter now correctly handles broken subscribers whose methods throw exceptions.
* New: Add `toString()` implementations for `Response` and `Result`.
* New: The Moshi converter factory now offers methods for enabling null serialization and lenient
  parsing.
* New: Add `createAsync()` to RxJava 1.x call adapter factory which executes requests using
  `Call.enqueue()` using the underlying HTTP client's asynchronous support.
* New: `NetworkBehavior` now allows setting an error percentage and returns HTTP errors when triggered.
* `HttpException` has been moved into the main artifact and should be used instead of the versions
  embedded in each adapter (which have been deprecated).
* Promote the response body generic type on `CallAdapter` from the `adapt` method to the enclosing
  class. This is a source-incompatible but binary-compatible change which is only relevant if you are
  implementing your own `CallAdapter`s.
* Remove explicit handling of the now-defunct RoboVM platform.
* Fix: Close response on HTTP 204 and 205 to avoid resource leak.
* Fix: Reflect the canceled state of the HTTP client's `Call` in Retrofit's `Call`.
* Fix: Use supplied string converters for the `String` type on non-body parameters. This allows user
  converters to handle cases such as when annotating string parameters instead of them always using
  the raw string.
* Fix: Skip a UTF-8 BOM (if present) when using the converter for Moshi.

## [2.1.0](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-2.1.0) - 2016-06-15

* New: `@HeaderMap` annotation and support for supplying an arbitrary number of headers to an endpoint.
* New: `@JsonAdapter` annotations on the `@Body` parameter and on the method will be propagated to Moshi
  for creating the request and response adapters, respectively.
* Fix: Honor the `Content-Type` encoding of XML responses when deserializing response bodies.
* Fix: Remove the stacktrace from fake network exceptions created from retrofit-mock's `NetworkBehavior`.
  They had the potential to be misleading and look like a library issue.
* Fix: Eagerly catch malformed `Content-Type` headers supplied via `@Header` or `@Headers`.

## [2.0.2](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-2.0.2) - 2016-04-14

* New: `ProtoConverterFactory.createWithRegistry()` method accepts an extension registry to be used
  when deserializing protos.
* Fix: Pass the correct `Call` instance to `Callback`'s `onResponse` and `onFailure` methods such
  that calling `clone()` retains the correct threading behavior.
* Fix: Reduce the per-request allocation overhead for the RxJava call adapter.

## [2.0.1](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-2.0.1) - 2016-03-30

* New: Support OkHttp's `HttpUrl` as a `@Url` parameter type.
* New: Support iterable and array `@Part` parameters using OkHttp's `MultipartBody.Part`.
* Fix: Honor backpressure in `Observable`s created from the RxJavaCallAdapterFactory.

## [2.0.0](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-2.0.0) - 2016-03-11

Retrofit 2 is a major release focused on extensibility. The API changes are numerous but solve
shortcomings of the previous version and provide a path for future enhancement.

Because the release includes breaking API changes, we're changing the project's package name from
`retrofit` to `retrofit2`. This should make it possible for large applications and libraries to
migrate incrementally. The Maven group ID is now `com.squareup.retrofit2`. For an explanation of
this strategy, see Jake Wharton's post, [Java Interoperability Policy for Major Version
Updates](http://jakewharton.com/java-interoperability-policy-for-major-version-updates/).

* **Service methods return `Call<T>`.** This allows them to be executed synchronously or
  asynchronously using the same method definition. A `Call` instance represents a single
  request/response pair so it can only be used once, but you can `clone()` it for re-use.
  Invoking `cancel()` will cancel in-flight requests or prevent the request from even being
  performed if it has not already.
* **Multiple converters for multiple serialization formats.** API calls returning different
  formats (like JSON, protocol buffers, and plain text) no longer need to be separated into
  separate service interfaces. Combine them together and add multiple converters. Converters are
  chosen based on the response type you declare. Gson is no longer included by default, so you will
  always need to add a converter for any serialization support. OkHttp's `RequestBody` and
  `ResponseBody` types can always be used without adding one, however.
* **Call adapters allow different execution mechanisms.** While `Call` is the built-in mechanism,
  support for additional ones can be added similar to how different converters can be added.
  RxJava's `Observable` support has moved into a separate artifact as a result, and support for
  Java 8's `CompletableFuture` and Guava's `ListenableFuture` are also provided as additional
  artifacts.
* **Generic response type includes HTTP information and deserialized body.** You no longer have to
  choose between the deserialized body and reading HTTP information. Every `Call` automatically
  receives both via the `Response<T>` type and the RxJava, Guava, and Java 8 call adapters also
  support it.
* **@Url for hypermedia-like APIs.** When your API returns links for pagination, additional
  resources, or updated content they can now be used with a service method whose first parameter
  is annotated with `@Url`.

Changes from beta 4:

* New: `RxJavaCallAdapterFactory` now supports service methods which return `Completable` which
  ignores and discards response bodies, if any.
* New: `RxJavaCallAdapterFactory` supports supplying a default `Scheduler` which will be used
  for `subscribeOn` on returned `Observable`, `Single`, and `Completable` instances.
* New: `MoshiConverterFactory` supports creating an instance which uses lenient parsing.
* New: `@Part` can omit the part name and use OkHttp's `MultipartBody.Part` type for supplying
  parts. This lets you customize the headers, name, and filename and provide the part body in a
  single argument.
* The `BaseUrl` interface and support for changeable base URLs was removed. This functionality
  can be done using an OkHttp interceptor and a sample showcasing it was added.
* `Response.isSuccess()` was renamed to `Response.isSuccessful()` for parity with the name of
  OkHttp's version of that method.
* Fix: Throw a more appropriate exception with a message when a resolved url (base URL + relative
  URL) is malformed.
* Fix: `GsonConverterFactory` now honors settings on the `Gson` instance (like leniency).
* Fix: `ScalarsConverterFactory` now supports primitive scalar types in addition to boxed for
  response body parsing.
* Fix: `Retrofit.callbackExecutor()` may now return an executor even when one was not explicitly
  provided. This allows custom `CallAdapter.Factory` implementations to use it when triggering
  callbacks to ensure they happen on the appropriate thread for the platform (e.g., Android).

## [2.0.0-beta4](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-2.0.0-beta4) - 2016-02-04

* New: `Call` instance is now passed to both `onResponse` and `onFailure` methods of `Callback`. This aids
  in detecting when `onFailure` is called as a result of `Call.cancel()` by checking `Call.isCanceled()`.
* New: `Call.request()` returns (optionally creating) the `Request` object for the call. Note: If this is
  called before `Call.execute()` or `Call.enqueue()` this will do relatively expensive work synchronously.
  Doing so in performance-critical sections (like on the Android main thread) should be avoided.
* New: Support for the release version of OkHttp 3.0 and newer.
* New: `adapter-guava` module provides a `CallAdapter.Factory` for Guava's `ListenableFuture`.
* New: `adapter-java8` module provides a `CallAdapter.Factory` for Java 8's `CompleteableFuture`.
* New: `ScalarsConverterFactory` (from `converter-scalars` module) now supports parsing response bodies
  into either `String`, the 8 primitive types, or the 8 boxed primitive types.
* New: Automatic support for sending callbacks to the iOS main thread when running via RoboVM.
* New: Method annotations are now passed to the factory for request body converters. This allows converters
  to alter the structure of both request bodies and response bodies with a single method-level annotation.
* Each converter has been moved to its own package under `retrofit2.converter.<name>`. This prevents type
  collisions when many converters are simultaneously in use.
* Fix: Exceptions thrown when unable to locate a `CallAdapter.Factory` for a method return type now
  correctly list the `CallAdapter.Factory` instances checked.
* Fix: Ensure default methods on service interfaces can be invoked.
* Fix: Correctly resolve the generic parameter types of collection interfaces when subclasses of those
  collections are used as method parameters.
* Fix: Do not encode `/` characters in `@Path` replacements when `encoded = true`.

## [2.0.0-beta3](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-2.0.0-beta3) - 2016-01-05

* New: All classes have been migrated to the `retrofit2.*` package name. The Maven groupId is now
  `com.squareup.retrofit2`. This is in accordance with the
  [Java Interoperability Policy for Major Version Updates](http://jakewharton.com/java-interoperability-policy-for-major-version-updates/).
  With this change Retrofit 2.x can coexiest with Retrofit 1.x in the same project.
* New: Update to use the OkHttp 3 API and OkHttp 3.0.0-RC1 or newer is now required. Similar to the previous
  point, OkHttp has a new package name (`okhttp3.*`) and Maven groupId (`com.squareup.okhttp3`) which allow
  it to coexist with OkHttp 2.x in the same project.
* New: String converters allow for custom serialization of parameters that end up as strings (such as `@Path`,
  `@Query`, `@Header`, etc.). `Converter.Factory` has a new `stringConverter` method which receives the
  parameter type and annotations and can return a converter for that type. This allows providing custom
  rendering of types like `Date`, `User`, etc. to a string before being used for its purpose. A default
  converter will call `toString()` for any type which retains the mimics the previous behavior.
* New: OkHttp's `Call.Factory` type is now used as the HTTP client rather than using the `OkHttpClient` type
  directly (`OkHttpClient` does implement `Call.Factory`). A `callFactory` method has been added to both
  `Retrofit.Builder` and `Retrofit` to allow supplying alternate implementations of an HTTP client. The
  `client(OkHttpClient)` method on `Retrofit.Builder` still exists as a convenience.
* New: `isExecuted()` method returns whether a `Call` has been synchronously or asynchronously executed.
* New: `isCanceled()` method returns whether a `Call` has been canceled. Use this in `onFailure` to determine
  whether the callback was invoked from cancellation or actual transport failure.
* New: `converter-scalars` module provides a `Converter.Factory` for converting `String`, the 8 primitive
  types, and the 8 boxed primitive types as `text/plain` bodies. Install this before your normal converter
  to avoid passing these simple scalars through, for example, a JSON converter.
* New: `Converter.Factory` methods now receive a `Retrofit` instance which also now has methods for querying
  the next converter for a given type. This allows implementations to delegate to others and provide
  additional behavior without complete reimplementation.
* New: `@OPTIONS` annotation more easily allows for making OPTIONS requests.
* New: `@Part` annotation now supports `List` and array types.
* New: The `@Url` annotation now allows using `java.net.URI` or `android.net.Uri` (in addition to `String`)
  as parameter types for providing relative or absolute endpoint URLs dynamically.
* New: The `retrofit-mock` module has been rewritten with a new `BehaviorDelegate` class for implementing
  fake network behavior in a local mock implementation of your service endpoints. Documentation and more
  tests are forthcoming, but the `SimpleMockService` demonstrates its use for now.
* Fix: Forbid Retrofit's `Response` type and OkHttp's `Response` type as the response body type given to
  a `Call` (i.e., `Call<Response>`). OkHttp's `ResponseBody` type is the correct one to use when the raw
  body contents are desired.
* Fix: The Gson converter now respects settings on the supplied `Gson` instance (such as `serializeNulls`).
  This requires Gson 2.4 or newer.
* The Wire converter has been updated to the Wire 2.0 API.
* The change in 2.0.0-beta2 which provided the `Retrofit` instance to the `onResponse` callback of `Callback`
  has been reverted. There are too many edge cases around providing the `Retrofit` object in order to allow
  deserialization of the error body. To accommodate this use case, pass around the `Retrofit` response
  manually or implement a custom `CallAdapter.Factory` does so automatically.

## [2.0.0-beta2](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-2.0.0-beta2) - 2015-09-28

* New: Using a response type of `Void` (e.g., `Call<Void>`) will ignore and discard the response body. This
  can be used when there will be no response body (such as in a 201 response) or whenever the body is not
  needed. `@Head` requests are now forced to use this as their response type.
* New: `validateEagerly()` method on `Retrofit.Builder` will verify the correctness of all service methods
  on calls to `create()` instead of lazily validating on first use.
* New: `Converter` is now parameterized over both 'from' and 'to' types with a single `convert` method.
  `Converter.Factory` is now an abstract class and has factory methods for both request body and response
  body.
* New: `Converter.Factory` and `CallAdapter.Factory` now receive the method annotations when being created
  for a return/response type and the parameter annotations when being created for a parameter type.
* New: `callAdapter()` method on `Retrofit` allows querying a `CallAdapter` for a given type. The
  `nextCallAdapter()` method allows delegating to another `CallAdapter` from within a `CallAdapter.Factory`.
  This is useful for composing call adapters to incrementally build up behavior.
* New: `requestConverter()` and `responseConverter()` methods on `Retrofit` allow querying a `Converter` for
  a given type.
* New: `onResponse` method in `Callback` now receives the `Retrofit` instance. Combined with the
  `responseConverter()` method on `Retrofit`, this provides a way of deserializing an error body on `Response`.
  See the `DeserializeErrorBody` sample for an example.
* New: The `MoshiConverterFactory` has been updated for its v1.0.0.
* Fix: Using `ResponseBody` for the response type or `RequestBody` for a parameter type is now correctly
  identified. Previously these types would erroneously be passed to the supplied converter.
* Fix: The encoding of `@Path` values has been corrected to conform to OkHttp's `HttpUrl`.
* Fix: Use form-data content disposition subtype for `@Multipart`.
* Fix: `Observable` and `Single`-based execution of requests now behave synchronously (and thus requires
  `subscribeOn()` for running in the background).
* Fix: Correct `GsonConverterFactory` to honor the configuration of the `Gson` instances (such as not
  serializing null values, the default).

## [2.0.0-beta1](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-2.0.0-beta1) - 2015-08-27

* New: `Call` encapsulates a single request/response HTTP call. A call can by run synchronously
  via `execute()` or asynchronously via `enqueue()` and can be canceled with `cancel()`.
* New: `Response` is now parameterized and includes the deserialized body object.
* New: `@Url` parameter annotation allows passing a complete URL for an endpoint.
* New: OkHttp is now required as a dependency. Types like `TypedInput` and `TypedOutput` (and its
  implementations), `Request`, and `Header` have been replaced with OkHttp types like `RequestBody`,
  `ResponseBody`, and `Headers`.
* New: `CallAdapter` (and `Factory`) provides extension point for supporting multiple execution
  mechanisms. An RxJava implementation is provided by a sibling module.
* New: `Converter` (and `Factory`) provides extension point for supporting multiple serialization
  mechanisms. Gson, Jackson, Moshi, Protobuf, Wire, and SimpleXml implementations are provided by sibling
  modules.
* Fix: A lot of things.
* Hello Droidcon NYC 2015!

## [1.9.0](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-1.9.0) - 2015-01-07

* Update to OkHttp 2.x's native API. If you are using OkHttp you must use version 2.0 or newer (the latest
  is 2.2 at time of writing) and you no longer need to use the `okhttp-urlconnection` shim.
* New: Allow disabling Simple XML Framework's strict parsing.
* New: `@Header` now accepts a `List` or array for a type.
* New: `@Field` and `@FieldMap` now have options for enabling or disabling URL encoding of names and values.
* Fix: Remove query parameters from thread name when running background requests for asynchronous use.

## [1.8.0](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-1.8.0) - 2014-11-18

* Update to RxJava 1.0. This comes with the project's 'groupId' change from `com.netflix.rxjava` to
  `io.reactivex` which is why the minor version was bumped.

## [1.7.1](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-1.7.1) - 2014-10-23

* Fix: Correctly log `null` request arguments for `HEADERS_AND_ARGS` log level.

## [1.7.0](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-1.7.0) - 2014-10-08

* New: `RetrofitError`'s `getKind()` now disambiguates the type of error represented.
* New: `HEADERS_AND_ARGS` log level displays parameters passed to method invocation along with normal
  header list.
* New: `@Part` and `@PartMap` now support specifying the `Content-Transfer-Encoding` of their respective
  values.
* New: `@Path`, `@Query`, and `@QueryMap` now have options for enabling or disabling URL encoding on
  names (where appropriate) and values.
* `@Header` now accepts all object types, invoking `String.valueOf` when neccesary.
* Attempting to use a `@Path` replacement block (`{name}`) in a query parameter now suggested `@Query` in
  the exception message.
* Fix: Correct NPE when `Content-Type` override is specified on requests without a body.
* Fix: `WireConverter` now correctly throws `ConversionException` on incorrect MIME types for parity with
  `ProtoConverter`.
* Fix: Include `Content-Type` on AppEngine requests.
* Fix: Account for NPE on AppEngine when the response URL was not automatically populated in certain cases.
* Fix: `MockRestAdapter`'s RxJava support now correctly schedules work on the HTTP executor, specifically
  when chaining multiple requests together.
* Experimental RxJava support updated for v0.20.

## [1.6.1](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-1.6.1) - 2014-07-02

* Fix: Add any explicitly-specified 'Content-Type' header (via annotation or param) to the request even
  if there is no request body (e.g., DELETE).
* Fix: Include trailing CRLF in multi-part uploads to work around a bug in .NET MVC 4 parsing.
* Fix: Allow `null` mock exception bodies and use the success type from the declared service interface.

## [1.6.0](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-1.6.0) - 2014-06-06

* New: `@Streaming` on a `Response` type will skip buffering the body to a `byte[]` before delivering.
* When using OkHttp, version 1.6.0 or newer (including 2.0.0+) is now required.
* The absence of a response body and an empty body are now differentiated in the log messages.
* Fix: If set, the `RequestInterceptor` is now applied at the time of `Observable` subscription rather
  than at the time of its creation.
* Fix: `Callback` subtypes are now supported when using `MockRestAdapter`.
* Fix: `RetrofitError` now contains a useful message indicating the reason for the failure.
* Fix: Exceptions thrown when parsing the response type of the interface are now properly propagated.
* Fix: Calling `Response#getBody` when `null` body now correctly returns instead of throwing an NPE.
* Experimental RxJava support updated for v0.19.
* The `Content-Type` and `Content-Length` headers are no longer automatically added to the header list
  on the `Request` object. This reverts erroneous behavior added in v1.5.0. Custom `Client` implementations
  should revert to adding these headers based on the `TypedInput` body of the `Request`.

## [1.5.1](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-1.5.1) - 2014-05-08

* New: `@PartMap` annotation accepts a `Map` of key/value pairs for multi-part.
* Fix: `MockRestAdpater` uses the `ErrorHandler` from its parent `RestAdapter`.
* Experimental RxJava support updated for v0.18 and is now lazily initialized.

## [1.5.0](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-1.5.0) - 2014-03-20

* New: Support for AppEngine's [URL Fetch](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/urlfetch/)
  HTTP client.
* New: Multipart requests of unknown length are now supported.
* New: HTTP `Content-Type` can be overridden with a method-level or paramter header annotation.
* New: Exceptions from malformed interface methods now include detailed information.
* Fix: Support empty HTTP response status reason.
* If an `ErrorHandler` is supplied it will be invoked for `Callback` and `Observable` methods.
* HTTP `PATCH` method using `HttpUrlConnection` is no longer supported. Add the
  [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp) jar to your project if you need this behavior.
* Custom `Client` implementations should no longer set `Content-Type` or `Content-Length` headers
  based on the `TypedInput` body of the `Request`. These headers will now be added automatically
  as part of the standard `Request` header list.

## [1.4.1](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-1.4.1) - 2014-02-01

* Fix: `@QueryMap`, `@EncodedFieldMap`, and `@FieldMap` now correctly detect `Map`-based parameter
  types.

## [1.4.0](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-1.4.0) - 2014-01-31

* New: `@Query` and `@EncodedQuery` now accept `List` or arrays for multiple values.
* New: `@QueryMap` and `@EncodedQueryMap` accept a `Map` of key/value pairs for query parameters.
* New: `@Field` now accepts `List` or arrays for multiple values.
* New: `@FieldMap` accepts a `Map` of name/value pairs for form URL-encoded request bodies.
* New: `Endpoint` replaces `Server` as the representation of the remote API root. The `Endpoints`
  utility class contains factories methods for creating instances. `Server` and `ChangeableServer`
  are now deprecated.
* `SimpleXmlConverter` and `JacksonConverter` now have a default constructor.
* `Response` now includes the URL.
* Fix: Hide references to optional classes to prevent over-eager class verifiers from
  complaining (e.g., Dalvik).
* Fix: Properly detect and reject interfaces which extend from other interfaces.

## [1.3.0](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-1.3.0) - 2013-11-25

* New: Converter module for SimpleXML.
* New: Mock module which allows simulating real network behavior for local service interface
  implementations. See 'mock-github-client' example for a demo.
* New: RxJava `Observable` support! Declare a return type of `Observable<Foo>` on your service
  interfaces to automatically get an observable for that request. (Experimental API)
* Fix: Use `ObjectMapper`'s type factory when deserializing (Jackson converter).
* Multipart POST requests now stream their individual part bodies.
* Log chunking to 4000 characters now only happens on the Android platform.

## [1.2.2](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-1.2.2) - 2013-09-12

* Fix: Respect connection and read timeouts on supplied `OkHttpClient` instances.
* Fix: Ensure connection is closed on non-200 responses.

## [1.2.1](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-1.2.1) - 2013-08-30

* New: Converter for [Wire protocol buffers](https://github.com/square/wire)!

## [1.2.0](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-1.2.0) - 2013-08-23

* New: Additional first-party converters for Jackson and Protocol Buffers! These are provided
  as separate modules that you can include and pass to `RestAdapter.Builder`'s `setConverter`.
* New: `@EncodedPath` and `@EncodedQuery` annotations allow provided path and query params that
  are already URL-encoded.
* New: `@PATCH` HTTP method annotation.
* Fix: Properly support custom HTTP method annotations in `UrlConnectionClient`.
* Fix: Apply `RequestInterceptor` during method invocation rather than at request execution time.
* Change `setDebug` to `setLogLevel` on `RestAdapter` and `RestAdapter.Builder` and provide
  two levels of logging via `LogLevel`.
* Query parameters can now be added in a request interceptor.

## [1.1.1](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-1.1.1) - 2013-06-25

* Fix: Ensure `@Headers`-defined headers are correctly added to requests.
* Fix: Supply reasonable connection and read timeouts for default clients.
* Fix: Allow passing `null` for a `@Part`-annotated argument to remove it from the multipart
  request body.

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-1.1.0) - 2013-06-20

* Introduce `RequestInterceptor` to replace `RequestHeaders`. An interceptor provided to the
  `RestAdapter.Builder` will be called for every request and allow setting both headers and
  additional path parameter replacements.
* Add `ErrorHandler` for customizing the exceptions which are thrown when synchronous methods
  return non-200 error codes.
* Properly parse responses which erroneously omit the "Content-Type" header.

## [1.0.2](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-1.0.2) - 2013-05-23

* Allow uppercase letters in path replacement identifiers.
* Fix: Static query parameters in the URL are now correctly appended with a separating '?'.
* Fix: Explicitly allow or forbid `null` as a value for method parameters.
  + `@Path` - Forbidden
  + `@Query` - Allowed
  + `@Field` - Allowed
  + `@Part` - Forbidden
  + `@Body` - Forbidden
  + `@Header` - Allowed

## [1.0.1](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-1.0.1) - 2013-05-13

* Fix: Correct bad regex behavior on Android.

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/square/retrofit/releases/tag/parent-1.0.0) - 2013-05-13

Initial release.

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Forbid path traversal ('.' and '..') as [@path](https://github.com/path) parameters.

They're likely to have the unintended effect. For example, passing ".."
to [@delete](https://github.com/delete) /account/book/{isbn}/ yields [@delete](https://github.com/delete) /account/.

# Retrofit

A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.

For more information please see [the website](https://square.github.io/retrofit/).

## Download

Download [the latest JAR](https://search.maven.org/remote_content?g=com.squareup.retrofit2&a=retrofit&v=LATEST) or grab from Maven central at the coordinates `com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.11.0`.

Snapshots of the development version are available in [Sonatype's `snapshots` repository](https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/).

Retrofit requires at minimum Java 8+ or Android API 21+.

## R8 / ProGuard

If you are using R8 the shrinking and obfuscation rules are included automatically.

ProGuard users must manually add the options from
[retrofit2.pro](https://github.com/square/retrofit/blob/master/retrofit/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/retrofit2.pro).
You might also need [rules for OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/r8_proguard/) which is a dependency of this library.
