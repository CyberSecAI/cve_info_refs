Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**1. Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of sanitization of SVG files during the upload process in the `uploadFileAction()` function within the `index.php` file of WonderCMS.

**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. By uploading a malicious SVG file containing JavaScript code, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary scripts in the victim's browser when the SVG is accessed.

**3. Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This allows the attacker to:
    -   Steal cookies, session tokens or other sensitive information
    -   Redirect the victim to a malicious website
    -   Deface the website
    -   Perform actions on behalf of the victim
    -   Potentially perform a range of other malicious activities.

**4. Attack vectors:**

-   **File upload:** The attack vector involves uploading a specially crafted SVG file to the server via the file upload functionality of the CMS.

**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   **Authenticated access (Admin):** The attacker needs to be logged in to the WonderCMS admin panel to access the file upload functionality and upload the malicious SVG file.
-   **Knowledge of vulnerable upload:** The attacker needs to know how to upload a SVG file.
