Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000193:

**1. Verification:**

The content from `jenkins.io` directly references `SECURITY-786 / CVE-2018-1000193`. This confirms that the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The Jenkins built-in user database allowed user registration without proper sanitization of user names, permitting the inclusion of control characters.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Insufficient input validation on user registration.
    *   Lack of sanitization of user names allowing control characters
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker could register user names that would be visually confusing to administrators, as they could appear to be different users.
    *   Users registered with control characters could be difficult or impossible to delete through the web UI.
*  **Attack vectors:**
    * An attacker with the ability to register a user account (typically done via a web interface).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to access the Jenkins instance and register new users. This often requires the registration feature to be enabled.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the user registration process of the built-in Jenkins user database.
*   The fix implements a restriction on user names, allowing only alphanumeric characters, dashes, and underscores.
*   Administrators can customize the restriction using the `hudson.security.HudsonPrivateSecurityRealm.ID_REGEX` system property, which allows a custom regex to define valid characters in a username.
    
**Summary:**

CVE-2018-1000193 is a low severity vulnerability that stems from insufficient input validation in the user registration process of Jenkins. An attacker able to create a new user could create usernames with control characters, making those usernames confusing and difficult to delete. A patch that sanitizes usernames is available.
