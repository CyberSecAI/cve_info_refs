Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000116:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A heap corruption vulnerability exists within the `net-snmp` framework. This vulnerability occurs while parsing the Protocol Data Unit (PDU) *before* the authentication process takes place.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can crash the `snmpd` process, leading to a denial of service.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potentially):** The vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the `snmpd` service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks by sending crafted SNMP messages.
- The vulnerability is triggered during the PDU parsing stage, which happens prior to authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
-  The attacker needs to be able to send crafted SNMP messages to the targeted system running vulnerable `net-snmp` service.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability is included in net-snmp version 5.7.2.1+dfsg-1+deb8u1 for Debian 7 "Wheezy".
- The vulnerability also affects the oldstable distribution (jessie) and has been fixed in the same version. The stable distribution (stretch) has been fixed before release.
- The vulnerability was identified in two separate Debian Security Advisories, DLA 1317-1 and DSA 4154-1.
