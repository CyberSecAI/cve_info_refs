- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Credentials Binding plugin, when specifying passwords and secrets as environment variables, fails to properly escape `$` characters in password values. Jenkins resolves references to other environment variables within the environment variables passed to a build. This can lead to a transformed value (e.g., `p4$w0rd` from `p4$$w0rd`) being passed to the build and displayed in the build log, revealing the actual password.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of escape characters in password values leading to unintended transformations. Secret value disclosure through build logs.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers with access to the build logs can reconstruct the actual password value from the transformed one. This is an information disclosure vulnerability, specifically, a credentials leak.
- **Attack vectors**:  An attacker can observe the transformed password value in the build logs, if the build definition is using an environment variable for credential storage and it has a `$` in the value
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have access to the build logs to view the exposed secret.
