- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The DRY plugin, along with several other static analysis plugins, was vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin parsed XML files without disabling external entity resolution, leading to the XXE vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers could configure build processes to parse maliciously crafted files, potentially extracting secrets from the Jenkins controller, performing server-side request forgery (SSRF), or causing denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by configuring a build process that uses a crafted XML file that includes external entities.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to configure build processes in Jenkins.
