{
  "CVE-2018-1000414": {
    "Root cause": "A URL used to save configuration files based on form submissions did not require POST requests.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "CSRF"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could potentially manipulate configuration files by exploiting the lack of POST request validation.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker could craft a malicious link or web page that, when visited by an authenticated user, would trigger the vulnerable URL to save configuration files.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user to trigger the malicious request. The user must have permissions to save the configuration files in question."
