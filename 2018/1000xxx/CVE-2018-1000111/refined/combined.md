This plugin adds the Subversion support (via SVNKit) to Jenkins.

# Basic Usage

Once this plugin is installed, you'll see Subversion as one of the options in the SCM section of job configurations. See inline help for more information about how to use it.

### Usage with Server Certificates

An important note for those wanting to use client certificates to authenticate to your subversion server. Your PKCS12 cert file must not have a blank passphrase or a blank export password as it will cause authentication to fail. Refer to [SVNKit:0000271](http://issues.tmatesoft.com/issue/SVNOLD-271 "SVNKit:0000271") for more details.

# Advanced Features/Configurations

## Proxy

You can set the proxy in C:/Users/<user>/AppData/Roaming/Subversion/servers (Windows) or ~/.subversion/servers (Linux)

*(Jenkins as a service on Windows : C:\Windows\SysWOW64\config\systemprofile\AppData\Roaming\Subversion\servers)*

> There's a tension between doing this in Jenkins vs following the existing Subversion convention â€” the former has a benefit of being available on all the agents. In this case, the proxy is a system dependent setting, which might be different between different agents, so I think it makes sense to keep it in ~/.subversion/servers. (See <https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-4041>)

## Post-commit hook

Jenkins can poll Subversion repositories for changes, and while this is reasonably efficient, this can only happen up to every once a minute, so you may still have to wait a full minute before Jenkins detects a change.

To reduce this delay, you can set up [a post commit hook](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.reposadmin.create.html#svn.reposadmin.create.hooks) so the Subversion repository can notify Jenkins whenever a change is made to that repository. To do this, put the following script in your `post-commit` file (in the $REPOSITORY/hooks directory):

```
REPOS="$1"
REV="$2"
UUID=`svnlook uuid $REPOS`
/usr/bin/wget \
  --header "Content-Type:text/plain;charset=UTF-8" \
  --post-data "`svnlook changed --revision $REV $REPOS`" \
  --output-document "-" \
  --timeout=2 \
  http://server/subversion/${UUID}/notifyCommit?rev=$REV

```

Notice the rev=$REV parameter, this tells Jenkins to check out exactly the revision which was reported by the hook. If your job has multiple Subversion module locations defined, this may lead to inconsistent checkouts - so it's recommended to leave out '?rev=$REV' in that case.
 You may also want to leave out the '?rev=$REV' parameter if you are using Maven to release your projects and do not want Jenkins to build the intermediate prepare-release commit (ie: the released artifacts).
 See [JENKINS-14254](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-14254) for details.

Jobs on Jenkins need to be configured with the SCM polling option to benefit from this behavior. This is so that you can have some jobs that are never triggered by the post-commit hook (in the $REPOSITORY/hooks directory), such as release related tasks, by omitting the SCM polling option. The configured polling can have any schedule (probably infrequent like monthly or yearly). The net effect is as if polling happens out of their usual cycles.

For this to work, your Jenkins has to allow anonymous read access (specifically, "Job > Read" access) to the system. If access control to your Jenkins is more restrictive, you may need to specify the username and password, depending on how your authentication is configured.

If your Jenkins uses the "Prevent Cross Site Request Forgery exploits" security option, the above request will be rejected with 403 errors ("No valid crumb was included"). The crumb needed in this request can be obtained from the URL `http:``//server/crumbIssuer/api/xml` (or `/api/json`). This can be included in the wget call above with something like this:

```
--header `wget -q --output-document - \
  'http://server/crumbIssuer/api/xml?xpath=concat(//crumbRequestField,":",//crumb)'`

```

### Considerations

Since `wget` by default retries up to **20 times** when not succeeding within the given timeout, `--timeout=2` on a slow SVN server may cause Jenkins to scan the repository many more times than needed, further slowing down the SVN Server which after a while makes Jenkins unresponsive.

Possible solutions to this problem are to increase the timeout, to add a lower maximum number of retries using the argument `--retries=3` or to make the `wget` call asynchronous (and thus ignoring any communication errors) by adding `2>&1 &` last on the `wget` call.

Having the timeout too low can also cause your commits to hang and throw either 502 errors if you are behind a proxy, or post-commit errors if not. Increasing the timeout until you no longer see wget retrying should fix the issue.

### More robust \*nix post-commit hook example

The basic script above is fine if your server does not do authentication or you have no problem providing anonymous read access to Jenkins (as well as anonymous read to all the individual jobs you want to trigger if you are using project-based matrix authorization). Here is a script that includes the more robust security concepts hinted at in the basic example.

```
#!/bin/sh
REPOS="$1"
REV="$2"

# No environment is passed to svn hook scripts; set paths to external tools explicitly:
WGET=/usr/bin/wget
SVNLOOK=/usr/bin/svnlook

# If your server requires authentication, it is recommended that you set up a .netrc file to store your username and password
# Better yet, since Jenkins v. 1.426, use the generated API Token in place of the password
# See https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Authenticating+scripted+clients
# Since no environment is passed to hook scripts, you need to set $HOME (where your .netrc lives)
# By convention, this should be the home dir of whichever user is running the svn process (i.e. apache)
HOME=/var/www/

UUID=`$SVNLOOK uuid $REPOS`
NOTIFY_URL="subversion/${UUID}/notifyCommit?rev=${REV}"
CRUMB_ISSUER_URL='crumbIssuer/api/xml?xpath=concat(//crumbRequestField,":",//crumb)'

function notifyCI {
    # URL to Jenkins server application (with protocol, hostname, port and deployment descriptor if needed)
    CISERVER=$1

    # Check if "[X] Prevent Cross Site Request Forgery exploits" is activated
    # so we can present a valid crumb or a proper header
    CONTENT_TYPE_HEADER="--header Content-Type:text/plain;charset=UTF-8"
    CRUMB=`$WGET --auth-no-challenge --output-document - ${CISERVER}/${CRUMB_ISSUER_URL}`
    if [ "$CRUMB" != "" ]; then CRUMB_HEADER="--header $CRUMB"; fi

    $WGET \
        --auth-no-challenge \
        $CONTENT_TYPE_HEADER \
        $CRUMB_HEADER \
        --post-data "`$SVNLOOK changed --revision $REV $REPOS`" \
        --output-document "-"\
        --timeout=2 \
        ${CISERVER}/${NOTIFY_URL}
}

# The code above was placed in a function so you can easily notify multiple Jenkins servers:
notifyCI "http://myPC.company.local:8080"
notifyCI "http://jenkins.company.com:8080/jenkins"

```

The script above takes care of the Prevent Cross Site Request Forgery exploits option if you have it enabled on your server. If you do not have that option enabled, the extra wget call is harmless, but feel free to remove it if you do not need it. The script above also requires that you set up a .netrc file in the home directory of the user you are running subversion as (either the svnserve process or httpd). For more info on .netrc file syntax, look [here](http://www.mavetju.org/unix/netrc.php). The script above makes it easy to notify multiple Jenkins servers of the same SVN commit. If you have a .netrc file, it keeps it easy even if they have different admin users set up. If you don't want to mess with a .netrc file, you could just hard-code the user and password (or API Token) info in the file and add --username=user and --password="pass" flags to the wget calls.

### Windows specific post-commit hook

The above script is difficult under the Windows command processor seeing as there is no support for backtick output extraction and there is no built in wget command. Instead the following contents can be added to `post-commit.bat` (in the $REPOSITORY/hooks directory):

```
SET REPOS=%1
SET REV=%2
SET CSCRIPT=%windir%\system32\cscript.exe
SET VBSCRIPT=C:\Repositories\post-commit-hook-jenkins.vbs
SET SVNLOOK=C:\Subversion\svnlook.exe
SET JENKINS=http://server/
REM AUTHORIZATION: Set to "" for anonymous acceess
REM AUTHORIZATION: Set to encoded Base64 string, generated from "user_id:api_token"
REM                found on Jenkins under "user/configure/API token"
REM                User needs "Job/Read" permission on Jenkins
SET AUTHORIZATION=""
"%CSCRIPT%" "%VBSCRIPT%" "%REPOS%" %2 "%SVNLOOK%" %JENKINS% %AUTHORIZATION%

```

The batch file relies on the following VBScript being available in the file designated by the `VBSCRIPT` variable above:

```
repos         = WScript.Arguments.Item(0)
rev           = WScript.Arguments.Item(1)
svnlook       = WScript.Arguments.Item(2)
jenkins       = WScript.Arguments.Item(3)
authorization = WScript.Arguments.Item(4)

Set shell = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell")

Set uuidExec = shell.Exec(svnlook & " uuid " & repos)
Do Until uuidExec.StdOut.AtEndOfStream
  uuid = uuidExec.StdOut.ReadLine()
Loop
Wscript.Echo "uuid=" & uuid

Set changedExec = shell.Exec(svnlook & " changed --revision " & rev & " " & repos)
Do Until changedExec.StdOut.AtEndOfStream
  changed = changed + changedExec.StdOut.ReadLine() + Chr(10)
Loop
Wscript.Echo "changed=" & changed

url = jenkins + "crumbIssuer/api/xml?xpath=concat(//crumbRequestField,"":"",//crumb)"
Set http = CreateObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP")
http.open "GET", url, False
http.setRequestHeader "Content-Type", "text/plain;charset=UTF-8"
if not authorization = "" then
  http.setRequestHeader "Authorization", "Basic " + authorization
end if
http.send
crumb = null
if http.status = 200 then
  crumb = split(http.responseText,":")
end if

url = jenkins + "subversion/" + uuid + "/notifyCommit?rev=" + rev
Wscript.Echo url

Set http = CreateObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP")
http.open "POST", url, False
http.setRequestHeader "Content-Type", "text/plain;charset=UTF-8"
if not authorization = "" then
  http.setRequestHeader "Authorization", "Basic " + authorization
end if
if not isnull(crumb) then
  http.setRequestHeader crumb(0),crumb(1)
end if
http.send changed
if http.status <> 200 then
  Wscript.Echo "Error. HTTP Status: " & http.status & ". Body: " & http.responseText
end if

```

## Perform Polling from the Controller

JIRA [JENKINS-5413](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-5413) documents problems with running the SCM polling trigger on agents. Version 1.21 of the Subversion plugin can perform the polling on the Jenkins controller if the hudson.scm.SubversionSCM.pollFromMaster system property is set to true.

## Subversion Revision and URL information as Environment Variables

The Subversion SCM plugin exports the svn revisions and URLs of the build's subversion modules as environment variables. These are $SVN\_REVISION\_n and $SVN\_URL\_n, where n is the 1-based index of the module in the configuration.

For backwards compatibility if there's only a single module, its values are also exported as $SVN\_REVISION and $SVN\_URL.

Note that the revision number exposed is the 'last-changed' revision number of the particular directory and not the current revision of the repository. (See [What are these two revision numbers in svn info?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9354877/what-are-these-two-revision-numbers-in-svn-info))

## Kerberos authentication

To connect to a Kerberos authenticated SVN repository see the [Subversion Plugin HTTPS Kerberos authentication](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Subversion%2BPlugin%2BHTTPS%2BKerberos%2Bauthentication) page.

# TroubleShooting

Someone suggested in the Jenkins IRC channel that if you are getting an error and a long svnkit stack trace that looks like:

```
 ERROR: svn: authentication cancelled

org.tmatesoft.svn.core.SVNCancelException: svn: authentication cancelled

```

Then,

* Try to delete (back up) the ~/.subversion folder and retry the build. Apparently mixing the command line svn client checkouts with those of your Jenkins jobs messes it up.
* See <http://blog.vinodsingh.com/2009/08/hudson-svn-authentication-cancelled.html> for details.

You could try to enable verbose log over the plugin an SVNKit library, to do that add a logger to those loggers with log level ALL , it is really verbose so just after configure it make the test and change the log level again to ERROR or INFO.

* svnkit
* svnkit-network
* svnkit-wc
* hudson.scm.SubversionSCM

## lightweight checkout capability for Subversion on Multibranch Pipeline projects and Externals support

Lightweight checkout capability for Subversion on Multibranch Pipeline projects does not support externals, so in order to use Subversion plugin in a Multibranch Pipeline project with a repository with externals, you should disable the lightweight checkout capability by setting the property `-Djenkins.scm.impl.subversion.SubversionSCMFileSystem.disable=<true/false>`

## Descriptions

### Environment Injector Plugin before 1.91 stored sensitive build variables

**SECURITY-248**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`envinject`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/envinject)**

**Description:**

EnvInject plugin stores environment variables in order to visualize them in the "Injected Environment Variables" view.
Sensitive build variables, typically passwords, are exempt from this behavior.
Plugin versions older than 1.91 (released on Mar 08, 2015) however did not exempt sensitive variables, and persisted them on disk too.
Such persisted sensitive variables may be displayed by any release of this plugin for builds run before it was updated to version 1.91 or newer.

While the bug persisting sensitive build variables has been addressed in release 1.91, there is no fix addressing this problem for historical build data.

You may be affected by this sensitive data exposure issue if all of the following are true:

* You define sensitive environment variables globally, per node, or per job.
* You have ever used Environment Injector Plugin 1.90 or older.
* You still have build records created while Environment Injector Plugin 1.90 or older was installed and enabled.

To prevent the further exposure of sensitive build variables, we recommend that you take the following steps if you are affected by this:

* Disable the visualization of Injected Environment variables in the global configuration.
  After this change the data will be accessible only to those ones who have access to raw build.xml files.
  This is a reversible action that can be applied immediately, and can be reverted once youâ€™ve purged the data on disk (below).
* Remove the sensitive data from disk by manually removing corresponding entries from `injectedEnvVars.txt` files, or deleting the `injectedEnvVars.txt` files in old build directories.
* Rotate all secrets that have potentially been exposed.
### Coverity Plugin stored keystore and private key passwords in plain text

**SECURITY-260
/
CVE-2018-1000104**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`coverity`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/coverity)**

**Description:**

The Coverity Plugin stored passwords unencrypted as part of its configuration.
This allowed users with Jenkins controller local file system access and Jenkins administrators to retrieve the stored password.
The latter could result in exposure of the passwords through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

The Coverity Plugin now integrates with [Credentials Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials) to store passwords, and automatically migrates existing passwords.

### Improper access control in Gerrit Trigger Plugin allowed unauthorized users to read some server configuration information

**SECURITY-402
/
CVE-2018-1000105**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`gerrit-trigger`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gerrit-trigger)**

**Description:**

Missing permission checks in Gerrit Trigger Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read permission to access a form that showed the configuration of Gerrit servers in Jenkins.
The key file password was only shown in its encrypted form, if configured.
Other options were plainly visible.

The missing permission check has been added.

### Improper access control in Gerrit Trigger Plugin allowed unauthorized users to modify global Gerrit Server configurations

**SECURITY-403
/
CVE-2018-1000106**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`gerrit-trigger`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gerrit-trigger)**

**Description:**

Missing permission checks in Gerrit Trigger Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read permission to perform the following actions:

* Configure Gerrit servers
* Connect and disconnect configured Gerrit servers

The missing permission checks have been added.

### Improper access control allowed users without ManageOwnership permission to change job ownership metadata in Job and Node ownership Plugin

**SECURITY-498
/
CVE-2018-1000107**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ownership`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ownership)**

**Description:**

Job and Node ownership Plugin did not prevent the ownership metadata being overwritten when a job or node configuration was updated from the CLI or using the remote API (`POST config.xml`).

This allowed users with Job/Configure permission but without ManageOwnership/Jobs permission to change job ownership metadata, and users with Computer/Configure but without ManageOwnership/Nodes to change node ownership metadata.

Changes to job or node ownership metadata via remote API now require ManageOwnership/Jobs or ManageOwnership/Nodes permission, respectively.
Changes to job or node ownership via CLI require Overall/Administer permission.

### Azure Slave Plugin bundled outdated httpclient library with denial of service vulnerability

**SECURITY-554
/
CVE-2015-5262**

**Severity (CVSS):**
medium

**Affected plugin:
[`azure-slave-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/azure-slave-plugin)**

**Description:**

The Azure Slave Plugin bundles a version of the httpclient library that is vulnerable to [CVE-2015-5262](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-5262).

As the plugin has been deprecated in favor of [Azure VM Agents Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/azure-vm-agents) in 2016, there are no plans to release a fix.
It has been removed from distribution per request by the former maintainers.

### Reflected cross-site-scripting vulnerability in report URL of CppNCSS Plugin

**SECURITY-712
/
CVE-2018-1000108**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`cppncss`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/cppncss)**

**Description:**

CppNCSS Plugin did not properly escape the report name and graph name, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.

Report name and graph name are now properly escaped.

### Unprivileged users are able to enumerate credential IDs in Google Play Android Publisher Plugin

**SECURITY-715
/
CVE-2018-1000109**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`google-play-android-publisher`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/google-play-android-publisher)**

**Description:**

Google Play Android Publisher Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring a job to select the one theyâ€™d like to use to authenticate with the Google Play API.

This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credential IDs.
Those could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

Additionally, a related form validation function would allow verification whether a specified credential is valid for use with the Google Play API.

Enumeration of credentials IDs and validation of specified credentials in this plugin now requires the permission to have the ExtendedRead permission (when that permission is enabled; otherwise Configure permission) to the job in whose context credentials are being accessed.

### Disclosure of user names and node names to unauthorized users through post-commit hook URL in Git Plugin

**SECURITY-723
/
CVE-2018-1000110**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`git`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/git)**

**Description:**

The class handling unauthenticated Git post-commit hook notification requests at the `/git/` path unnecessarily extended another type that handled requests to the `Ã¢Â€Â¦/search/` sub-path.

This allowed submission of search queries to Jenkins, and getting a list of search results usually available to anyone with Overall/Read permission.
In current Jenkins releases, those are typically the names of known users (both actual users of Jenkins, and known SCM committers) and nodes (built-in node and agents).

The class handling requests to `/git/` no longer extends the class handling requests to the `Ã¢Â€Â¦/search/` sub-path, therefore any such requests will fail.

### Disclosure of user names and node names to unauthorized users through post-commit hook URL in Subversion Plugin

**SECURITY-724

CVE-2018-1000111**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`subversion`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/subversion)**

**Description:**

The class handling unauthenticated Subversion post-commit hook notification requests at the `/subversion/` path unnecessarily extended another type that handled requests to the `Ã¢Â€Â¦/search/` sub-path.

This allowed submission of search queries to Jenkins, and getting a list of search results usually available to anyone with Overall/Read permission.
In current Jenkins releases, those are typically the names of known users (both actual users of Jenkins, and known SCM committers) and nodes (built-in node and agents).

The class handling requests to `/subversion/` no longer extends the class handling requests to the `Ã¢Â€Â¦/search/` sub-path, therefore any such requests will fail.

### Disclosure of user names and node names to unauthorized users through post-commit hook URL in Mercurial Plugin

**SECURITY-726

CVE-2018-1000112**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`mercurial`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/mercurial)**

**Description:**

The class handling unauthenticated Mercurial post-commit hook notification requests at the `/mercurial/` path unnecessarily extended another type that handled requests to the `Ã¢Â€Â¦/search/` sub-path.

This allowed submission of search queries to Jenkins, and getting a list of search results usually available to anyone with Overall/Read permission.
In current Jenkins releases, those are typically the names of known users (both actual users of Jenkins, and known SCM committers) and nodes (built-in node and agents).

The class handling requests to `/mercurial/` no longer extends the class handling requests to the `Ã¢Â€Â¦/search/` sub-path, therefore any such requests will fail.

### Stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in TestLink Plugin

**SECURITY-731
/
CVE-2018-1000113**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`testlink`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/testlink)**

**Description:**

Users with Job/Configure permission were able to configure TestLink reports to display arbitrary unescaped HTML e.g. in test case names.

The plugin now properly escapes its HTML output.

### Promoted Builds Plugin allowed unauthorized users to run some promotion processes

**SECURITY-746
/
CVE-2018-1000114**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`promoted-builds`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/promoted-builds)**

**Description:**

Users with Job/Read access were able to approve and re-execute promotion processes with a manual promotion condition that did not specify a list of users allowed to manually approve the promotion.

The plugin now requires users to have the Promotion/Promote permission to be able to approve or re-execute a promotion with manual condition that does not specify a list of users allowed to approve it.

The following additional changes to permission enforcement were implemented in this update to make condition enforcement consistent for the three actions Approve, Re-Execute, and Force:

|  | Some of these changes allow users to act on some promotions they were not able to act on in 2.x releases of this plugin. |
| --- | --- |

1. Users with just the Promotion/Promote permission are no longer allowed to re-execute or force promotions with a manual condition that specifies a list of users, unless the user is on that list.
2. Administrators are now able to approve any promotion with a manual condition.
3. Users specified in a manual promotion condition are now allowed to force this promotion.
