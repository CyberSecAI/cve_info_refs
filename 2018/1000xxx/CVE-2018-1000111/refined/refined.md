Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000111:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Subversion plugin's post-commit hook notification handler (`/subversion/` path) incorrectly extended a class designed for handling search requests (`.../search/` sub-path). This led to unintended behavior where requests to `/subversion/` could trigger search queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper access control:** The plugin didn't properly restrict access to the search functionality, allowing unauthenticated users to trigger search queries by sending requests to the `/subversion/` endpoint. This vulnerability is a type of information disclosure.
- **Incorrect class inheritance:** The root cause is that the handler for the post-commit hook was incorrectly inheriting the functionality of a search handler.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to enumerate user and node names within the Jenkins instance by sending crafted requests to the `/subversion/` endpoint. This information, normally available only to users with Overall/Read permission, could be leveraged for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** Attackers could send unauthenticated HTTP requests to the Jenkins server's `/subversion/` endpoint. The post-commit hook is designed to be called by the subversion server when a commit occurs, however the vulnerability allowed any unauthenticated request to be used.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the Jenkins server.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability existed because the class handling `/subversion/` requests extended a class intended for `/search/` requests.
- The fix involved ensuring the `/subversion/` handler no longer extends the search handler class.
- This issue was resolved in Subversion Plugin version 2.10.3
- Similar vulnerabilities were identified in the Git (CVE-2018-1000110) and Mercurial (CVE-2018-1000112) plugins.
