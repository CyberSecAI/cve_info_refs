The provided content relates to CVE-2018-1000137.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of CSRF protection in the `users.php` file, specifically within the password reset functionality. The application directly uses GET parameters for critical operations like password changes, without proper verification of the request's origin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The application does not validate the origin of password change requests, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
Direct usage of GET parameters for password change operation. This can be easily exploited with a crafted link or form.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can force a password reset for an administrator account by crafting a malicious HTML page, thus gaining unauthorized access. In the specific case outlined, the admin's password can be forced to a value of "12345678".

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a malicious webpage or link that is loaded in a victim's browser while they are authenticated to the vulnerable application. Specifically, a form is crafted with the necessary parameters (`id`, `force_password`, and `new_password`) and auto-submitted.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to:
1.  Have knowledge of the vulnerable application's URL.
2.  Be able to craft HTML and JavaScript to form a malicious form and auto-submit it.
3.  The victim needs to be logged into the i-librarian application when the attack is triggered.
