The provided content is related to CVE-2018-1000023.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly handle unexpected input data sent to the `/insight-api/tx/send` endpoint, resulting in an error message that includes the full file path of the node application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Full Path Disclosure (FPD). The application reveals sensitive information (full server paths) in error messages.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain knowledge of the server's internal directory structure, which could aid in further attacks, such as identifying configuration files, other vulnerabilities, or sensitive data locations.

**Attack vectors:** Sending unexpected or malformed data to the `/insight-api/tx/send` endpoint. Specifically, the issue occurs when the `rawtx` parameter is not a valid transaction hex string.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any special privileges.
