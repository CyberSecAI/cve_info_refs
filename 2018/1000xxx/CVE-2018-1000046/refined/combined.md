### @tjlang **[tjlang](/tjlang)** commented [Aug 1, 2017](#issue-247184174)

v1.4 Major Changes (08/01/2017):

1. Removed gzip and pickle dependencies, and added h5py dependency.
2. Due to security risk associated with pickle module, changed the

   temporary block data file to HDF5 format. This revised the

   RawDataStorage class.
3. Some documentation improvements.

Sorry, something went wrong.
