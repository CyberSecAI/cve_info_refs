Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000184:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing permission check in a form validation method within the GitHub Plugin. This allowed unauthorized users to trigger a server-side request forgery (SSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The plugin allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to make Jenkins send a POST request to a URL specified by the attacker.
- **Missing Permission Check:** The form validation method lacked proper authorization checks, allowing users with insufficient privileges to trigger the vulnerability.
- **CSRF Vulnerability:** The form validation method did not require POST requests, making it susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with Overall/Read access to Jenkins could cause the Jenkins server to send a POST request to an arbitrary URL, potentially enabling them to interact with internal systems or perform other malicious actions.
- The server-side request forgery could lead to information disclosure, data modification, or denial of service depending on the attacker-controlled URL.
- The form validation would return a generic success message if the requestâ€™s HTTP response code indicates success, and return the HTTP status code otherwise, this could aid an attacker in probing the response to the SSRF.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker would need Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
- The attacker would need to craft a malicious request targeting the vulnerable form validation method with the malicious URL.
- The attack is initiated by sending a request to the Jenkins server which causes it to send a POST request to an arbitrary URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
- No additional permissions are necessary to exploit the vulnerability, provided they can reach Jenkins.
- No specific user interaction is required beyond gaining access.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is addressed by requiring POST requests for form validation and by enforcing the Overall/Administer permission.
- The advisory mentions this vulnerability was reported by Thomas de Grenier de Latour.
- This CVE was part of a larger security advisory that addressed vulnerabilities in several Jenkins plugins.
