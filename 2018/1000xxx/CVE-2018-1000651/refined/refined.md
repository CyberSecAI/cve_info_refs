Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000651:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the use of an XML parser that is not properly configured to disable external entities (XXE). The code utilizes `XMLReader` without disabling external entity processing.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The core vulnerability is that the XML parser processes external entities. This occurs because the `XMLReader` is used without setting a feature to prevent resolving external entities.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Disclosure of confidential data:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive information by referencing local files.
-   **Denial of service (DoS):** Malicious XML can cause the application to consume excessive resources, leading to DoS.
-   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Attackers can force the server to make requests to internal or external resources.
-   **Port scanning:** The attacker can scan ports from the perspective of the server.
-   Other system impacts: This may include other unforeseen impacts on the system depending on the environment.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is through processing malicious XML input which contains a reference to an external entity.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to submit XML input that is processed by the vulnerable XML parser in the application.
- The attacker does not necessarily need to be local but should be able to send a request to the server containing the malicious XML.

**Additional notes:**

- The vulnerability exists in `stroom/stroom-core-server/src/main/java/stroom/entity/util/XMLUtil.java` at lines 114-117.
- The code snippet uses `XMLReader` directly without disabling external entities.
- The issue was reported on 23rd July 2018.
- The blog post was published on 8th August 2018 and CVE was applied for on the same day.
