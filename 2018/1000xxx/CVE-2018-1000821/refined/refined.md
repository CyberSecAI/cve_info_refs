Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000821:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the use of an insecurely configured XML parser within the `ImportFromSMathStudio.java` file of the microMathematics application. The `DocumentBuilderFactory` is used to parse XML input without disabling external entity processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The application is vulnerable to XXE injection because it processes XML input without disabling external entities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the XXE vulnerability can lead to:
- **Disclosure of confidential data:** Attackers can potentially read sensitive files from the server's filesystem.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Malicious XML could cause the server to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The attacker can force the server to make requests to other internal or external servers.
- **Port Scanning:** An attacker can use the server to perform port scans of internal networks.
- **Other System Impacts:** The vulnerability can potentially be used as a stepping stone for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious SMathStudio file containing an XML payload with a reference to an external entity.
- The application, upon parsing this file, will process the external entity, triggering the XXE vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted SMathStudio file to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker does not necessarily require prior authentication or privileges within the system, they only need to be able to pass the malicious XML file as input to the vulnerable application.
