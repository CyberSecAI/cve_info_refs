Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000833:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of the `unserialize()` function in PHP. The application directly deserializes user-provided input without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Object Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a PHP Object Injection. The application receives base64-decoded data from the `probe` parameter in the request, which is then directly passed to the `unserialize()` function.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** The code does not sanitize or validate the input before deserialization, making it vulnerable to manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By crafting a malicious serialized PHP object, an attacker can trigger arbitrary code execution on the server when the object is deserialized. This is possible if the application contains classes with "magic methods" like `__wakeup` or `__destruct` which may be used to trigger OS level commands.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** The deserialization process might trigger other actions, such as information disclosure, depending on the classes available in the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Parameter:** The attack vector is through the `probe` parameter in the HTTP request. The attacker crafts a malicious payload, base64-encodes it, and sends it as the value of the `probe` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker also needs to know the structure of a valid PHP serialized object and how to craft a malicious one.
*   Knowledge of existing classes within the application that could have exploitable "magic methods" to trigger code execution upon deserialization is necessary for more effective exploitation.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `web/skins/classic/views/onvifprobe.php` file, specifically at line 216.
*   The issue was reported on October 24, 2018, and a blog post about it was published on October 28, 2018.
*   The provided information goes beyond the official CVE description by detailing the exact location and nature of the vulnerability, as well as the attack vector.
