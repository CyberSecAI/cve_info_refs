Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2018-1000506:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Metronet Tag Manager plugin's settings page did not properly validate the nonce when saving options, specifically the Google Tag Manager code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):**  The plugin failed to check the nonce on option settings page, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks. This allowed an attacker to submit malicious settings using a crafted request without the victim's consent.
- **Unescaped Output:** The plugin outputs the Google Tag Manager code without escaping, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Injection:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into the Google Tag Manager code, which would execute in the browsers of all users visiting the website.
- **Admin Browser Control:** By injecting JavaScript, an attacker could control an administrator's browser, potentially enabling them to perform actions that an admin user can do, such as modifying site content, adding malicious code, or taking over the entire site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A crafted HTML form can be used to submit malicious settings to the plugin.
- A successful attack can be carried out by tricking an administrator into visiting a malicious webpage or by using other methods to execute malicious code in an administrator's browser

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not require authentication to exploit this vulnerability directly, but needs to be able to trick an authenticated admin user into interacting with malicious content.
- The attacker can be remote, as the vulnerability can be exploited through network requests.
