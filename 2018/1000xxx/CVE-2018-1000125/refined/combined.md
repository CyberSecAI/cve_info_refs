## Description

[![@dmak](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/366965?v=4&size=48)](/dmak)[dmak](https://github.com/dmak)opened [on Jan 30, 2018](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-jwt/issues/2#issue-292726226)

Please doublecheck this is a valid issue. According to [JWS §4.1.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-signature-41#section-4.1.1) "alg" Header Parameter MUST be present and MUST be understood and processed by implementations.

In my opinion that means that if "alg" is not "none", then signature must be present and verified. Attached

[JwtTest.java.txt](https://github.com/inversoft/prime-jwt/files/1677222/JwtTest.java.txt) demonstrates the problem.
