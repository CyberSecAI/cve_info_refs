Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2018-1000125:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the library not properly checking for the presence of a signature when a signature algorithm is specified in the JWT header. According to the JWS specification, if the "alg" header parameter is present and is not "none", a signature must be present and verified.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The library allows a JWT to be decoded without a valid signature, even when the header specifies a signing algorithm.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could forge a JWT by setting a signing algorithm but providing no signature, potentially leading to unauthorized access or other security breaches where JWT validation is relied upon for authorization.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted JWT that has a signing algorithm specified in the header but lacks a signature.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to create and supply a modified JWT with the above conditions. No specific network position or other system access appears to be required beyond being able to submit this JWT to the vulnerable system.

**Additional Details:**
The provided content contains a "CHANGES" file log, where the fix for CVE-2018-1000125 is mentioned in version 1.3.0: "Fixed potential security issue that may allow a JWT to be decoded without a valid signature." The issue #2 reported on Github details this problem.
