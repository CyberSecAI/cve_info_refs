The provided content relates to CVE-2018-1000138.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insufficient check on the host provided in a URL. Specifically, the code attempts to prevent SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) by checking if the host is 'localhost'. However, this check can be bypassed by using wildcard DNS services like xip.io, which resolve to the local IP.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate input validation: The code uses a simple string comparison (`$host === 'localhost'`) which is easily bypassed by using domain names that resolve to the same IP, like `127.0.0.1.xip.io`.
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): The application makes a request to an arbitrary URL based on user-controlled input without proper validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can force the server to make requests to internal resources, potentially leading to information disclosure or denial of service.
- The server could be used as a proxy to scan internal infrastructure or interact with services not accessible directly from the outside.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is the `form_new_file_link` parameter in the `ajaxsupplement.php` script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make POST requests to the `ajaxsupplement.php` endpoint with a valid `PHPSESSID` cookie.
- The attacker must supply a malicious URL through the `form_new_file_link` parameter, which bypasses the localhost check. For example, `http://127.0.0.1.xip.io:1337/ssrf`.
